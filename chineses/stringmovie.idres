movie_40_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I feel dizzy. Did someone spike my medicine?
movie_40_3=<font color="#ffff00">Doctor Xue: </font>Don't worry. The medicine works. After it takes effect, all will be well.

movie_41_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>!
movie_41_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Where are the sounds of the Qin and Zheng from?
movie_41_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> It's coming from this room.
movie_41_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>The sound of the Qin is quiet but not serene, slow but not tranquil. Who is playing it?
movie_41_5=<font color="#ffff00">Doctor Xue: </font>I have heard the sound of the qin many times, but I've never seen anyone play it.
movie_41_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Maybe the expert doesn't want to be bothered.
movie_41_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Why does this music sound so sad?
movie_41_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Doctor Xue, may I go along with you?
movie_41_9=<font color="#ffff00">Doctor Xue: </font>I have to leave and find the sheriff. Make your own way.
movie_41_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Well. Thank you for your help, Doctor Xue. I'll repay your kindness in the future.
movie_41_11=<font color="#ffff00">Doctor Xue: </font>No need for such formalities. Don't forget to find me in the Boat House.
movie_41_12=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I'm willing to part with it.
movie_41_13=<font color="#00FFFF">Why do I still hear the qin? I'd better tell my Shifu about it.</font>
movie_42_1=<font color="#00FFFF">I hear footsteps outside the door.</font>
movie_42_2=<font color="#ffff00">Little Acolyte: </font>Zu Jing!
movie_42_3=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>What's wrong? Why are you so panicked?
movie_42_4=<font color="#ffff00">Little Acolyte: </font>A Wanderer's Valley disciple has come here with a message from his leader. He wants to have a duel with the masters of our temple.
movie_42_5=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>Eh, our temple has never associated with such an Evil Sect. This people must provoke deliberately. Where is he now?
movie_42_6=<font color="#ffff00">Little Acolyte: </font>He is waiting behind the palace.
movie_42_7=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>Eh, you should be careful when you deal with this matter.
movie_42_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Let me test his martial arts.
movie_43_1=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Jing: </font>Our temple is so unlucky.
movie_43_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> What happened?
movie_43_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Jing: </font>Amitabha. What's the matter?
movie_43_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Abbot has asked me to learn martial arts from you.
movie_43_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Jing: </font>Zu Jing is not willing to teach right now.
movie_43_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Why did you say that?
movie_43_7=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Jing: </font>I am embarrassed to say this, but my first disciple practiced martial arts for 20 years and lost to his younger brother in a duel.
movie_43_8=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Jing: </font>He's been depressed ever since.
movie_43_9=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Jing: </font>Zu Jing reproached himself bitterly about this whole thing. If he wasn't so strict with him in his early years, he wouldn't regret it now. So Zu Jing won't teach others martial arts in order to avoid wasting others' time. Amitabha.
movie_43_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> So you're saying that as long as I continue to work hard and also think of a way to lift Brother Qingshan's spirits, you'll teach me how to fight?
movie_43_11=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Jing: </font>Amitabha. Zu Jing, don't hope that he still makes things difficult for himself. But if you can make him calm down, he will teach you all the martial arts he knows.
movie_43_12=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I'll give it a try.
movie_44_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Thank you for teaching me these skills.
movie_44_2=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Jing: </font>Amitabha. Martial Nephew, no need to be so polite. It is Zu Jing's job. But Zu Jing has made things difficult for you because of his own matters. It is a shameful matter.
movie_44_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Jing: </font>We should all devote ourselves to saving all living creatures.
movie_44_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Do not blame yourself.
movie_45_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Amitabha...
movie_45_2=<font color="#00FFFF">A bell is ringing in the distance...</font>
movie_45_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> What's this bell sound I hear?
movie_45_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Jing: </font>It sounds like the temple bell. The Abbot might want us t? gather at the back hill. We don't know what the matter is.
movie_46_1=<font color="#ffff00">Little Acolyte: </font>Amitabha! Abbot Xuanhuai is here!
movie_46_2=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>Amitabha.
movie_46_3=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>Certain disciples stood out enough in the competition to practice in the martial arts house.
movie_46_4=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>In consultation with the Hermit Monks, they will be promoted and can begin practicing in the martial arts house as of today.
movie_46_5=<font color="#00FFFF">I occasionally hear a shrill voice in the crowd.</font>
movie_46_6=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>The list of disciples who can practice in the martial arts house is: Qing Cheng, Qing Hong, Qing Xuan, servants and...
movie_46_7=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>That concludes the list. I hope all of you will strive to practice diligently. Amitabha.
movie_46_8=<font color="#ffff00">All Disciples: </font>Amitabha, we are in compliance with Abbot's Instruction.
movie_46_9=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>The disciples who aren't chosen this time should perform Zazen and think of the difference between you and others in order to make progress.
movie_46_10=<font color="#ffff00">All Disciples: </font>Amitabha, we are in compliance with Abbot's Instruction.
movie_46_11=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>Eh, well, since everybody knows about this, please leave.
movie_47_1=<font color="#ffff00">Little Acolyte: </font>Elder Zujing, the abbot would like to discuss an important matter with you.
movie_47_2=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Jing: </font>Amitabha. Since Abbot invites you, you just go there.
movie_47_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Yes, elder.
movie_48_1=<font color="#00FFFF">Are those footsteps I hear?</font>
movie_48_2=<font color="#ffff00">Little Acolyte: </font>Elder, something's wrong.
movie_48_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Chan: </font>What's wrong? Why so panicked?
movie_48_4=<font color="#ffff00">Little Acolyte: </font>Elder, Qing Yuan found a strange weapon hidden in the training room.
movie_48_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Chan: </font>Oh? What Hidden Weapon is it? Take it to me and let me take a look.
movie_48_6=<font color="#00FFFF">You're looking carefully, Zuchan.</font>
movie_48_7=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Chan: </font>Hmm. It does not belong to our temple. Where is Qing Yuan?
movie_48_8=<font color="#ffff00">Little Acolyte: </font>He's training. You can find him in the training hall.
movie_48_9=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Chan: </font>Go ask him to come here.
movie_48_10=<font color="#ffff00">Little Acolyte: </font>Yes. I will follow the elder's orders.
movie_48_11=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Elder, what's this?
movie_48_12=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Chan: </font>It looks like a flying smoking pipe. It does not belong to our temple.
movie_48_13=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Which school does it belong to?
movie_48_14=<font color="#ffff00">Zu Chan: </font>I don't know about it. Maybe Abbot knows it.
movie_49_1=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>Judging from its patterns, this hidden weapon is quite poisonous. Only evil sects would dare to use it.
movie_49_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Evil Sect? Is it related with Rainbow Hell?
movie_49_3=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>This can't be right... Although I must say, this hidden weapon was created using some quite unusual forging skills. I'll have to think here...
movie_49_4=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>...
movie_49_5=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>This Hidden Weapon is small and special. I think it does not belong to Royal Guards. Then, shouldn't it be...
movie_49_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>It probably isn't Wanderer's Valley.
movie_49_7=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>It is possible.
movie_49_8=<font color="#00FFFF">I hear footsteps outside the door.</font>
movie_49_9=<font color="#ffff00">Little Acolyte: </font>Elder, something's wrong.
movie_49_10=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>Amitabha. Why are you so panicked?
movie_49_11=<font color="#ffff00">Little Acolyte: </font>Hmm. Three Elder Brothers who were ordered to guard the almsgiver of Wanderer's Valley have come back. All of them are injured seriously.
movie_49_12=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>What?
movie_49_13=<font color="#ffff00">Little Acolyte: </font>I heard he was with that almsgiver at Fengwan Forest when he was attacked.
movie_49_14=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Amitabha, how did things end up like this? Abbot, I'll go to Fengwan Forest now and catch this thief.
movie_49_15=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>It's not urgent. There is another thing you need to do.
movie_50_1=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Lingyou: </font>Hang in there, senior fellow apprentice. We're returning to Wudang Mountain now, so let Shifu help you. You have to hold out a little longer.
movie_50_2=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Xuanchen: </font>*Cough cough*. I... I...
movie_50_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font><font color="#00FFFF"> Something seems wrong with those Wudang disciples. I should see if I could help... </font>
movie_50_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Amitabha. Judging from your apparel, I'm assuming you are disciples of Wudang. Are you in trouble? Can I help you?
movie_50_5=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Lingyou: </font>Amitayus Buddha, you people are engaged in the same pursuit with Shaolin. We escorted a Wanderer's Valley thief to Yanyu Villa but were attacked by a mysterious person veiled in black.
movie_50_6=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Lingyou: </font>We managed to ward them off, but my elder brother was seriously injured. I really hope he survives this.
movie_50_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Amitabha. Did not you take emergency medicine with you?
movie_50_8=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Lingyou: </font>My Elder Brother poisoned and we don't have the antidote. My Eldest Martial Brother tried to go after the enemy, and I'm stuck here.
movie_50_9=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> We are schoolmates and should help each other. Please tell me the prescription, Wudang Taoist. I'll help you find it.
movie_51_1=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Lingyou: </font>Take this pill, senior fellow apprentice. You will get better soon.
movie_51_2=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Xuanchen: </font>*Cough cough* Ah, I have troubled you. I will come and thank you later.
movie_51_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Amitabha. When our schoolmates are in trouble, it is our duty to assist them. Moreover, our monks will be merciful. You don't need to behave in this way.
movie_51_4=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Lingyou: </font>All right, so what do you do here?
movie_51_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> The monks never boast. I come here for my three Elder Brothers who have been attacked when they escorted Wanderer's Valley thieves.
movie_51_6=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Lingyou: </font>Shaolin also encountered this? Not such a simple matter after all.
movie_51_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>You were both attacked here. Do you have any clues?
movie_51_8=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Lingyou: </font>We are also puzzled. But our Elder Brother has already gone after that group of people headed for Hanshan Temple. We don't know what he found.
movie_51_9=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Amitabha. If that's how things are, I suppose I'll go look.
movie_52_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>I'm not tired, Abbot. How do you think I should handle this matter?
movie_52_2=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>The reputation of Wanderer's Valley is not good.
movie_52_3=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>We'd better pay close attention to them.
movie_52_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Yes, Abbot.
movie_52_5=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>I will send others to all great schools to inform them to be on guard. You're very tired the whole way, Martial Nephew, and it's time to have a good rest.
movie_52_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Abbot, I'm not tired. I can still do many things.
movie_52_7=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>He-he, it's very kind you have this intention. But I think you should focus on training now, Martial Nephew. During the time you went out of the temple, you delayed many trainings and daily lessons. So it's not good if it goes on like this.
movie_52_8=<font color="#ffff00">Abbot Xuanhuai: </font>Before we don't know the purpose of Wanderer's Valley, you should reinforce martial training and daily lessons, Martial Nephew. You should be recognized by your peers earlier and improve your status in the temple. In future, you can be arranged to do more important things.
movie_52_9=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I'll keep your instructions in mind, Abbot.
movie_53_21=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font><font color="#00FFFF">What are they talking about? I'll go ask them.</font>
movie_54_1=<font color="#ffff00">Woman: </font>Little Taoist, let me in!
movie_54_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font><font color="#00FFFF"> Is that a woman's voice outside the door?</font>
movie_54_3=<font color="#ffff00">Woman: </font>Did you not hear me? Go away!
movie_54_4=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist: </font>Lady, you really ought to leave. I won't let you in.
movie_54_5=<font color="#ffff00">Woman: </font>I can't believe it! I've come from afar to learn martial arts. Why won't you let me in? Has Wudang become like Shaolin? Do you only accept monks?
movie_54_6=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist: </font>It's not that we reject women, no no.
movie_54_7=<font color="#ffff00">Woman: </font>Now that female disciples are able to join, why won't you let me in?
movie_54_8=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist: </font>Hold on, Lady. Can I finish?
movie_54_9=<font color="#ffff00">Woman: </font>No! Let us be martial sisters in the future. Help me out, won't you?
movie_54_10=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist: </font>Wudang is a tranquil place but it is not suitable for a lady. I advise you to leave the premises.
movie_54_11=<font color="#ffff00">Woman: </font>Everybody has their shortcomings. I have a temper, so I've come to tame it through cultivation.
movie_54_12=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist: </font>All right, I don't want to say much. Pardon my bluntness, but there's no way you could ever become a Wudang Disciple.
movie_54_13=<font color="#ffff00">Woman: </font>Hmm! Let's Leader Immortal decide for himself if he ca? take me as his disciple! It's none of your buniness, Little Taoist
movie_54_14=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist: </font>You are exceedingly unreasonable, lady. I don't want to split hairs over the fact that you plotted against my Elder Brother, but if you don't give it up soon, I might have to resort to less polite measures.
movie_54_15=<font color="#ffff00">Woman: </font>If word of this gets out, Wudang's reputation will suffer.
movie_54_16=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist: </font>What a wicked tongue you have! You, you...
movie_54_17=<font color="#ffff00">Woman: </font>Shut it, you! If you don't let me in, I'll stay right here!
movie_54_18=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font><font color="#00FFFF"> I'd better ask Elder Brother Ling Qingzi what's wrong.</font>
movie_5017_1=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}:</font> It's good to be back.
movie_5017_3=<font color="#f790ce">Tangmen Disciples:</font>Hello, initiate.

movie_5017_8=<font color="#f790ce">Tang Qiu:</font>(sighs) All right.
movie_5017_9=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Qiu:</font>Three days ago, I saw Tang Guanqun kill someone.
movie_5017_10=<font color="#f790ce">Villager:</font> (coughing) What was that? What did you feed me?
movie_5017_11=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Guanqun:</font> Poison, of course. I'm a Tangmen, you fool. What did you expect?
movie_5017_12=<font color="#f790ce">Villager:</font> It hurts. IT HURTS!
movie_5017_13=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Guanqun:</font> Hmm. Good batch.
movie_5017_14=<font color="#f790ce">Tang Qiu:</font> Why would he test poisons on living people?
movie_5017_15=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Qiu:</font> What do you think? What shoud I do?
movie_5017_16=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>We can report him. Or we can handle him ourselves.
movie_5017_17=<font color="#f791ce">Tang Qiu:</font> Hmm. Give me a moment to think.
movie_5017_18=<font color="#f792ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Of course, brother.
movie_5017_19=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Qiu:</font> Thank you.

movie_447_2=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Yishan:</font> This colored glaze cup is nice too. It'd be better if the petals were just a bit smaller. I'm so lucky this time. It's my first time to get so many good things since I was engaged in this business.
movie_447_3=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Yishan:</font> You... Who are you?
movie_448_1=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Wuyan:</font> Elder Brother Tie, we should stop them if we want to rescue the two kids.
movie_448_2=<font color="#ffff00">Tie Bi:</font>  Miss Qiu, don't worry! The spies of our mountain stronghold cover are everywhere. I'll let you know if there is any sign of trouble.
movie_448_3=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Wuyan:</font>Elder Brother Tie, thanks for your help!
movie_448_4=<font color="#ffff00">Subordinate</font> Report! It's been reported that a group of soldiers escorting two kids are passing through Yuanmen.
movie_448_5=<font color="#ffff00">Tie Bi:</font> We'll set off. We won't let these bandits get away!
movie_449_1=<font color="#ffff00">Jia Chao:</font> As Eunuch Cao expected, Zhou Zhi'an and those guys entered the Longmen Inn and they intended to leave through Longmen Pass.
movie_449_2=<font color="#ffff00">Cao Chong:</font> In my opinion, we should surround the inn immediately and kill all of them.
movie_449_3=<font color="#ffff00">Chang Xiaochi:</font> No! We haven't made it clear. So we shouldn't act hastily. Let's wait for the army of Eunuch Cao!
movie_449_4=<font color="#ffff00">Cao Chong:</font> But what should we do if they escape?
movie_449_5=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Xiaojiang:</font>Well let's do it this way. Jia Chao and I will go to Longmen Inn first. We can check the details and stall Zhou Zhi'an for a while. You can wait for Eunuch Cao here. When the main forces arrive, we'll kill all of them.
movie_449_6=<font color="#ffff00">Chang Xiaochi:</font> That's a great idea! They can't escape from Longmen Pass as long as Cao Chong and I are here.
movie_450_1=<font color="#ffff00">Spy:</font> Eunuch Jia, Zhou Zhi'an's followers live in the inn and nothing happened up to now.
movie_450_2=<font color="#ffff00">Jia Chao:</font> I got it! He can't escape from our East Chamber's control since Xiaojiang and I are taking charge of the matter. You can go now!
movie_450_3=<font color="#ffff00">Spy:</font> Then I'll go!
movie_450_4=<font color="#ffff00">Jia Chao:</font> There's nothing here. You can go too.
movie_450_5=<font color="#ffff00">Jia Chao:</font> Watch your mouth! One slip and you'll be brutally reminded of what the East Chamber is capable of.
movie_451_1=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Wuyan:</font> Brother Tie, Xiaoqin, bring the two kids to the inn. Fellow swordsmen, go to the cart shop and take a carriage.

movie_453_4=<font color="#ffff00">Desert Sword King: </font>If I released you, they would all laugh at me and I'd be shamed.

movie_453_8=<font color="#ffff00">Steward Hua: </font>Hu lin and Su Bing, don't worry about me. You should break through the tight encirclement to contact the officer. Zhou Zhi'an has arrived at the Longmen Inn. Dispatch the men to rescue him. I'm afraid he will be in danger if it is late. Go now!
movie_453_9=<font color="#ffff00">Su Bing: </font>Keeper Hua, don't worry. Leave it to us. You should take care and wait for us. We will bring help here.

movie_453_11=<font color="#ffff00">Hu Lin: </font>Su Bing, we should not disregard Steward Hua!
movie_453_12=<font color="#ffff00">Su Bing: </font>Yes, but the two of us can do nothing.
movie_453_13=<font color="#ffff00">Hu Lin: </font>In my opinion, you should trace them and see where they have taken the Steward Hua. I will call for aid myself. Then I can know where we should rescue him.
movie_453_14=<font color="#ffff00">Su Bing: </font>Okay! You take care! I will leave markings on the path as I go. You can find me according to the marks when you get help.

movie_455_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Miss Bi Lu, please stand up. Horse thieves have no scruples, and there's no evil act they won't commit! I'd say anybody has the right to punish them. What are your plans?
movie_455_3=<font color="#ffff00">Bi Lu:</font> My heart is free from worry and obligation. I'd like to wander around with Master Zhu.

movie_456_1=<font color="#ffff00">Chang Xiaochi:</font> Zhou Zhi'an is cunning. He must be plotting to trap the enemy. If we set out too soon, we might ruin Eunuch Cao's big plan.
movie_456_2=<font color="#ffff00">Cao Chong:</font>So you're afraid that Zhou Zhi'an? Pff.  If we can't deal with him for colluding with people withint the organization and outside of it, how could we possibly save the face of the four leaders of East Chamber? Hmm?
movie_456_3=<font color="#ffff00">Chang Xiaochi:</font> Don't underestimate the enemy. I heard that there is a place called <font color="#ff0000">Helan Mountain</font> in the southeast. It's 50 miles from here. A gang of cunning horse thieves live there.
movie_456_4=<font color="#ffff00">Chang Xiaochi:</font> We just need to tell the thugs and they'll be willing to spearhead the attack. What do you think?
movie_456_5=<font color="#ffff00">Chao Chong:</font>Good idea. That gives me the chance to see if Zhou Zhi'an can live up to his reputation.
movie_457_1=<font color="#ffff00">Chao Zhengqing:</font> We have to put a stop to this now. If we don't kill those two kids, they will cause problems one day.
movie_458_1=<font color="#ffff00">Liba Ye'er:</font> Cao Zhengqing has a great plan. If he marches with me to Jinling to pillage the Ming Dynasty, I'll help him seize the throne.

movie_485_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Ziji: </font>Hmm.This matter goes back to a time before I came to this village.
movie_485_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Ziji: </font>I used to be a master assassin, guided by my Seven Invisible Movements. I would kill just about anyone if the price was right.
movie_485_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Ziji: </font>But I was as lonely as a ghost. Killing people was the only thing that made me happy, but that happiness was only temporary. I suffered from intense loneliness.
movie_485_6=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Ziji: </font>I became afraid of killing people gradually. I was afraid of the loneliness I felt after killing people, but I didn't have a choice. I was a killer. I couldn't control my life.

movie_485_10=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Ziji: </font>The villagers were so gentle and kind. I was filled with a happiness that I have never felt before. I became a part of their lives over time. I went fishing and sold fish with them quite often.
movie_485_11=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Ziji:</font> Then I met Yue'e and we had a baby. Happiness came so easily back then, and that was the life I wanted. I swore I would stay out of trouble. I wanted to start over.
movie_485_12=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Ziji:</font> I had committed a grave sin. How could I solve all my problems by running away?
movie_485_13=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Ziji:</font> Those people came here seeking revenge. Although I didn't kill these villagers with my own hands, it was my fault they died.
movie_485_14=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Ziji: </font>I can't remember how many people I have killed. I don't know how many more enemies will come to me to seek revenge. If I stay here, I will just cause the people to suffer.

movie_485_16=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Ziji:</font> After I calm these villagers down, I'll take my wife and children to live in seclusion, far away from this mess.

Metal generates water, water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal; Metal restricts wood, wood restricts earth, earth restricts water, water restricts fire, fire restricts metal. The skills of the five elements are mutually restraining.
movie_1003_11=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>The flag lord Tian Feng of the five elements is a kung fu master but is rather domineering. If I'm not mistaken, he wants to control Green Cloud Castle and refuses to let other manage it with him. If we can't survive the Five-Element Array, we won't last a minute in Green Cloud Castle.
movie_1004_1=<font color="#ffff00">Tian Feng: </font>It seems the Five-Element Array has been broken by a group of younger members. Am I still qualified to deal with the matters of Green Cloud Castle?
movie_1004_2=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>With all due respect, you're wrong. I may not know much about kung fu, but I do know a bit about the five elements, the eight diagrams and the Qimen arrays. I doubt you'll be able to handle them!
movie_1004_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Thank Flag Lord Tian for being merciful.
movie_1004_4=<font color="#ffff00">Tian Feng: </font>Hmm, it is!
movie_1004_5=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>Also, I've been invited by Lord Shen and have no hostility. Flag Lord Tian, I find that all the people in Green Cloud Castle belong to you. I don't see even one person of the Shen Family.
movie_1004_6=<font color="#ffff00">Tian Feng: </font>I've just arrived at Green Cloud Castle. People are attacking anyone they come across. Our Five-Element flag has cleaned up the people in the forecourt and is gone to investigate in the back.
movie_1004_7=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>How about working it out in two different directions? The first thing is to find out who's in charge of Green Cloud Castle.
movie_1004_8=<font color="#ffff00">Tian Feng: </font>Okay!
movie_1004_9=<font color="#ffff00">Tian Feng:</font>Okay!
movie_1004_10=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng:</font> {@0:}, let's go find the intermediary of Green Cloud Castle.
movie_1005_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>You're here, Mr. Qiu. Do you find something?
movie_1005_3=<font color="#ffff01">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>Nine of the rods on one side of the railing of the pavilion are well worn. It's obvious that people pass by them frequently.
movie_1005_4=<font color="#ffff02">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>The nine squares in this pavilion are drawn according to the pattern on the back of the mythical turtle that emerged from the waters of Luoyang.
movie_1005_5=<font color="#ffff03">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>The magic square was drawn according to the nine strange drawings on the holy tortoise's back. The main character of the Nine Palace is that the nine figures added up to fifteen vertically, horizontally and diagonally.
movie_1005_7=<font color="#ffff01">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>Four... Nine... Two... Three... Five... Seven... Eight... One... Six...
movie_1006_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Mr. Qiu, Flag Lord Tian, you already got here. Who is this person?
movie_1006_2=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>This is Shen Qingyun, the lord of Green Cloud Castle.
movie_1006_3=<font color="#ffff00">Tian Feng: </font>Lord Shen, what on earth's the matter?
movie_1006_4=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Qingyun: </font>It's a long story. I feel shocked and terrified every time I mention this matter. It was on Tomb-sweeping Day this year when the Shen Family was worshipping its ancestors...
movie_1006_5=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Qingyun: </font>At that time, people started noticing the unusual butterflies. Three days later, my wife died...
movie_1006_6=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Qingyun: </font>From then on, many servants believed Shen Family was inauspicious and fled.
movie_1006_7=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Qingyun: </font>The next day, scores of butterflies attacked Green Cloud Castle. I fled to the basement with my family. The servants who were not able to escape were bitten to death or went crazy in the yard.
movie_1006_8=<font color="#ffff00">Tian Feng: </font>Were there some indications before that matter?
movie_1006_9=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Qingyun: </font>I am not sure whether you believe in ghosts.
movie_1006_10=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>If you believe it, it exists. If you don't believe it, it does not exist…
movie_1006_11=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Qingyun: </font>Tomb-sweeping Day is the anniversary of my father's death. He was killed by butterflies eight years ago.
movie_1006_12=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Qingyun: </font>My father didn't believe in ghosts at that time and stole treasures from Luoyang Xiangshan King's grave. In the eight years that passed, nothing unusual happened. Then one day…
movie_1006_13=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Qingyun: </font>These things are much too strange. I feel shocked every time I recall them.
movie_1006_14=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>Don't be too worried, elder brother Shen. We need to give the matter more thought.
movie_1006_15=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Qingyun: </font>Huh? you've come from afar, why not take it easy and relax first. In Mr. Qiu's opinion, we should give the matter further thought.
movie_1006_16=<font color="#ffff01">Shen Qingyun: </font>Xiaoyue, take each of them to rest up.
movie_1007_1=<font color="#ffff00">Madamn Shen: </font>Save him soon, save him soon!
movie_1007_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Lord Shen...
movie_1007_3=<font color="#ffff00">Tian Feng: </font>Madamn Shen, step aside. Let's break down the door.
movie_1007_4=<font color="#ffff00">Tian Feng: </font>{@IDName:Player}, What are you doing there? Help me open this door by force!
movie_1008_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Ah, Mr. Qiu, you would know this: What are the backgrounds of Sun Tian, Guo Di and Xue Ren?
movie_1008_2=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>Rumor has it that ten years ago there used to be a hermit named Hentian. His kung fu was formidable and he knew the Qimen array well.
movie_1008_3=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>He had four disciples called the Fire Cloud Four Brothers. They were mentioned in your letter.
movie_1008_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Are they really as powerful as people have said?
movie_1008_5=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>Xue Ren was called Thousand Hands and was a master of hidden weapons. He could wield them so quickly and so spontaneously that even Tangmen folk keep their distance from him.
movie_1008_6=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>The Brother Di Gou Di, who was called Holy Fire, was more powerful than Xue Ren.
movie_1008_7=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>As for Brother Tian Sun Tian, or "Penetrating Cloud", no one has ever seen his true features.
movie_1008_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Since these three people are so skilled, could their master the elder Hentian be even more skilled? How come I've never heard of this person?
movie_1008_9=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng: </font>It's strange that for almost five years no one has heard anything about him. He is eccentric, aloof and proud.
movie_1008_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Mr. Qiu, in your opinion, is Green Cloud Castle related to Fire Cloud Villa?
movie_1008_11=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Sheng the Drunkard: </font>It's possible. I hope we can clear things up when the people arrive from Fire Cloud Villa.
movie_1008_12=Three days later...
movie_1009_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Xiaoyue, it's you! What have you done?
movie_1009_2=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng:</font>She isn't Xiaoyue.
movie_1009_3=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng:</font>Am I right? Madame Shen...
movie_1009_4=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng: </font>If I hadn't seen the twin dumb maids at the same time in the Qingyun Castle, I wouldn't have noticed that someone might hide his identity in disguise of the dumb maid.
movie_1009_5=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng:</font>As a matter of fact, the foul smell at the scene of murdering is the medicine that controls the butterflies. This butterfly-controlling skill has broadened my field of vision. Unexpectedly the whole thing is but a trap...
movie_1009_6=<font color="#ffff00">Madame Shen:</font> Drunkard Qiusheng lives up to his reputation. You may have been useful to me before, but now none of you will leave this place alive!
movie_1009_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Escort Mr. Qiu out.
movie_1010_1=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng: </font>The whole thing is a trap, but I just don't get it; why are you doing this, Madame Shen?
movie_1010_2=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng: </font>Watch out!
movie_1010_3=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng: </font>You know this secret weapon?
movie_1010_4=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}:</font>That day, I investigated the death of Boss Shi of the Baqiao Bookstore. At the time when I was forcing Mr. Xu to tell me the chief plotter behind the scenes. He was killed by the same secret weapon. Could they be the same person?
movie_1010_5=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng: </font>This person seems to be familiar with the secret room of Qingyun Castle.
movie_1010_6=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng: </font>Seeing from the skills of this man, he is probably from the Huoyun Villa. Could the Huoyun Three Brothers have arrived?
movie_1011_1=<font color="#ffff00">Guo Di: </font>The Qingyun Castle has suffered a butterfly invasion and now Shen Qingyun sent a carrier pigeon asking us to come post haste. What's going on?
movie_1011_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xue Ren: </font>I've heard of the butterfly disaster. Who knew that people as skilled as Shen Qingyun could be killed like that.
movie_1011_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xue Ren: </font>You seem different lately. Are you up to something?
movie_1011_4=<font color="#ffff00">Guo Di: </font>As long as we focus on Huoyon Villa, we will one day rule!
movie_1011_5=<font color="#ffff00">Xue Ren: </font>Second brother, usually Brother Sun comes very early in the morning. Why we haven't seen him now?
movie_1011_6=<font color="#ffff00">Guo Di: </font>I think I just saw Brother Sun pass by. What's he doing?
movie_1011_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xue Ren: </font>Second brother, don't you think all the things here are strange? There are so many new faces in Qingyun Castle. Even Tian Feng, Chief of the Five-Color Flag, and Drunkard Qiusheng, author of Qiusheng Essays, are here. And then there's that mysterious iron man who passed by...
movie_1011_8=<font color="#ffff00">Xue Ren: </font>This feels like a trap...
movie_1011_9=<font color="#ffff00">Guo Di: </font>Well, we must find what we're looking for.
movie_1011_10=<font color="#ffff00">Xue Ren: </font>Then how about the others in Qingyun Castle?
movie_1011_11=<font color="#ffff00">Guo Di:</font>Either Huoyun's friends or Huoyun's enemies. After we find the thing we need, we'll kill them all. No one shall leave Qingyun Castle alive.
movie_1011_12=<font color="#ffff00">Guo Di: </font>Third brother, you'd better search the refining room carefully. I'm going to take a look at the gunpowder room.
movie_1011_13=<font color="#ffff00">Xue Ren: </font>Don't worry.
movie_1011_14=<font color="#ffff00">Guo Di: </font>Go!
movie_1012_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Hmm, Sun Tian, where are you going today?
movie_1012_2=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng: </font>That isn't Sun Tian.
movie_1012_3=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng: </font>I know everything, Chief Shen!
movie_1012_4=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Qingyun:</font> I underestimated you.
movie_1012_5=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng:</font> Chief Shen, did Huoyun Village not hatch a secret plan five years ago to produce an extremely powerful weapon?
movie_1012_6=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng:</font> His death must have been faked to hide his research!
movie_1012_7=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Zhen:</font>I've underestimated you.
movie_1012_8=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng: </font>The Huoyun Three Brothers also underestimated you. To do in your three older brothers, you set a trap by using your madam's butterfly-controlling skill and kill the informers of your brothers in Qingyun Castle.
movie_1012_9=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng:</font> He used Xu to spread the butterfly murder rumor, then killed him.
movie_1012_10=<font color="#ffff00">Tian Feng: </font>The butterfly attack eight years ago is clearly just a rumor! People thought you were killed by the butterflies, and left just me and {@0:} to deal with Huoyun Villa.
movie_1012_11=<font color="#ffff00">Tian Feng:</font>Because you had expected Guo Di and Xue Ren to come find the powerful killing weapon after they heard of your death. Then you could sit and watch them fight, and gain from it without getting your hands dirty. Disguise yourself as Sun Tian and divert their attention.
movie_1012_12=<font color="#ffff00">Xue Ren: </font>Fourth brother, what's wrong in the world?
movie_1012_13=<font color="#ffff00">Guo Di:</font> My elder brother has been missing and you have his weapon. Murderer!
movie_1012_14=<font color="#ffff00">Guo Di: </font>Wu Zhen, we trusted you then and moved the secret plan of Huoyun Villa to Qingyun Castle, asking you to keep the unfinished Huoyun Automatic Fire Gun. Why do you have to do it this way?
movie_1012_15=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Zhen: </font>Trust? If you trusted me, you wouldn't have sent so many people to keep an eye on me.
movie_1012_16=<font color="#ffff00">Xue Ren: </font>Fourth brother, we're all fellow kin. We're just doing this to protect you, so you can research the metal for the Successive Shooting Fire Gun in peace.
movie_1012_17=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Zhen: </font>With his disciples? One mountain is not big enough for two, let alone four people! You'll destroy this place and I'll be left with nothing.
movie_1012_18=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Zhen: </font>You're only using me, and after all is done you will treat me the way you treated the master that year. Then you three will fight and kill each other.
movie_1012_19=<font color="#ffff00">Xue Ren: </font>Fourth brother, don't forget that you were also involved in the plot against our master. You also trapped him in the Tianmen Divine Array using the skills you learned from him. You killed Brother Sun to get his key, didn't you?
movie_1012_20=<font color="#ffff00">Guo Di: </font>Fourth brother, how is the Huoyun Automatic Fire Gun progressing?
movie_1012_21=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Zhen: </font>After five years, I've finally found a type of metal that can endure the intense heat of the gun when it fires.
movie_1012_22=<font color="#ffff00">Xue Ren: </font>So the Huoyun Automatic Fire Gun is a success. Can you show us now?
movie_1012_23=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Zhen: </font>Well there's just this one little flaw. After successive firing, the heat from the bore takes forever to dissipate.
movie_1012_24=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Zhen: </font>The old man must have kept something from me. After you're all dead, I'll get all four of the keys. I must go ask the old man, heh heh.
movie_1012_25=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng: </font>Wu Zhen, you're very cunning.
movie_1012_26=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Zhen: </font>Drunkard Qiusheng, I planned to keep you alive because I thought you were useful, but now you serve no purpose and you know too much. Go to hell!
movie_1012_27=<font color="#ffff00">Xue Ren: </font>Fourth brother, no...
movie_1012_28=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Zhen: </font>So hot!
movie_1012_29=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>What else do you have?
movie_1012_30=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Zhen: </font>Any hope you had is gone!
movie_1013_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Mr. Qiu, could these be the four keys Wu Zhen was talking about?
movie_1013_2=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng: </font>Oh? Do you remember the dragon carving that you can see when you first enter Qingyun Castle? There are four holes in it, and these four things can enable the Huoyun Four Brothers to keep the keys separately. There must be great secrets at hand.
movie_1013_3=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng:</font>It's better to not be late. Try to put these four pieces into the four gaps.
movie_1014_1=Heh heh heh...
movie_1014_2=<font color="#ffff00">Chou Hentian: </font>My good disciples!
movie_1014_3=<font color="#ffff00">Chou Hentian: </font>As your master, I've taught you all my skills. How can you treat me like this?
movie_1014_4=<font color="#ffff00">Chou Hentian: </font>I am free again!
movie_1014_5=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng: </font>It's Elder Hentian! He's been imprisoned here all along!
movie_1014_6=<font color="#ffff00">Chou Hentian:</font>My good disciples, where are they?
movie_1014_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Chuanyun Sun Tian, Shenhuo Guo Di, and Qianshou Xue Ren were all killed by Wu Zhen so I killed him.
movie_1014_8=<font color="#ffff00">Chou Hentian:</font>Wretched cur, what do you know? So you too are meddling in the affairs of Huoyun Village? Even if my disciples have been committing crimes, I'm the only one who can punish them! Give me my disciple back!
movie_1015_1=<font color="#ffff00">Zui Qiusheng:</font> Could this be the legendary Tianmen Divine Array?
movie_1015_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Tianmen Divine Array?
movie_1015_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zui Qiusheng:</font>"Qi" means the three Qis, Yi, Bing and Ding; "Men" means the 8 gates, Stop, Life, Injury, Du, Blood, Death, Shock and Kai; "Dun" means to hide; "Jia" means the 6 Jias, Jia Zi, Jia Shu, Jia Shen, Jia Wu, Jia Chen and Jia Yin. Jia is the most important one among the ten Heavenly Stems, and it's invisible, hiding behind the Six Yi. "Six Yi" means Wu, Ji, Gen, Xin, Ren and Kui.
movie_1015_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zui Qiusheng:</font>The hiding principles: Jia Zi hides behind Wu earth; Jia Shu hides behind Ji earth; Jia Shen hides behind Geng metal; Jia Wu hides behind Xin metal; Jia Chen hides behind Ren water; and Jia Yin hides behind Kui water.
movie_1015_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zui Qiusheng:</font>The six Jias hide behind the six Yi respectively, namely Jia Zi Wu, Jia Shu Ji, Jia Shen Geng, Jia Wu Xin, Jia Chen Ren and Jia Yin Kui. These are the permanent rules.
movie_1015_6=<font color="#ffff00">Zui Qiusheng:</font>The six Jias hide behind the six Yi respectively, sharing the space of the Nine Palaces and Eight Diagrams with the three Qis (Yi, Bing and Ding). The three Qis and six Yi and ten Heavenly Stems distribute in the Nine Palaces and Eight Diagrams, pactising clockwise and counterclockwise and forming the 18 patterns of Yin hiding and Yang hiding, i.e. the eighteen arrays. In Chi Men Dun Jia, this is called Yang Hiding Nine Patterns and Yin Hiding Nine Patterns, totally eighteen patterns. These are the eighteen settled patterns of the Earth Plate.
movie_1015_7=<font color="#ffff00">Zui Qiusheng:</font>Yang hiding means six Yi clockwise and three Chi counterclockwise. In other words, from the first to the ninth palaces, the sequence is Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, Ren, Kui, Ding, Bing and Yi.  Yin hiding means six Yi counterclockwise and three Chi clockwise. In other words, from the first to the ninth palaces, the sequence is the opposite to Yang hiding.
movie_1015_8=<font color="#ffff00">Zui Qiusheng:</font> The Tianmen Divine Array is based on the eight diagrams.

movie_1015_14=<font color="#ffff00">Zui Qiusheng:</font>No, though the array is perfectly designed, it's not fatal everywhere. If you're lucky enough, you will be able to turn the corner and be safe.
movie_1015_15=<font color="#ffff00">Drunkard Qiusheng:</font>The eight immortals go with or against the winds of the eight gates, and the nine stars travel in and out of the nine palaces. If I know the theories of Yin and Yang well, I'll be master of heaven and earth.

movie_498_11=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>We still have a lot of the Tatar army's rations here. Let's burn it up just to make things difficult for them.
movie_498_12=<font color="#ffff00">Garrison: </font>Good thinking. That'll definitely motivate our troops.
movie_498_13=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>All right then. Let's discuss the details.
movie_512_1=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Jitun: </font>Go!
movie_512_2=<font color="#ffff00">Liu Fangshuo: </font>It's too late to go.
movie_512_3=<font color="#ffff00"> Tartar Military officer: </font>Marshal, the enemy was ambushed during the night attack. See to it that our brothers wipe them out.
movie_512_4=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu Er'tuo: </font>That's good.
movie_512_5=<font color="#ffff00">Liu Fangshuo: </font>We have General Fang to thank for our victory.
movie_512_6=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu Er'tuo: </font>Come General Fang, have a bowl of wine and rest up. We can torture this scum tomorrow.
movie_512_7=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Jitun: </font>Your loathing for the enemy is as deep as the sea. But thousands civilians are innocent. To do these things, would it be in keeping with the example set by your father, Fang Xiaoru?
movie_512_8=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Wuhen: </font>Shut up! You don't deserve to mention my father's name! If it weren't for you, how could our Fang Family end up slaying ten tribes?
movie_512_9=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Wuhen: </font>You deceived me! I treated a thief as my father all these years, and I was so disloyal and unfilial.
movie_512_10=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Jitun: </font>Your father sacrificed everything for the state and the people. He fought tirelessly against the turncoat army.
movie_512_11=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Jitun: </font>Your father would have been so ashamed of all the destruction you've caused.
movie_512_12=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Jitun: </font>Everything is there now. It's not necessary to judge who is right and who is wrong in the battles. We might have betrayers or rotten kings, but as long as all the people live a peaceful and happy life, it will be all right. If your father were still alive he'd say the same thing.
movie_512_13=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Jitun: </font>I hope you consider taking my life instead of the emperor's. Perhaps that will set things right.
movie_512_14=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu Ertuo: </font>General Fang, don't listen to him! In his view, loyalty and filial piety are worth nothing!
movie_512_15=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Jitun: </font>Before he left, your father knew you were all right. He sent a letter to me. The letter says? After my son grows up, if the world...
movie_512_16=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu Ertuo: </font>We can't keep him here. Yanmen Pass has suffered heavy casualties and cannot withstand further attacks. It's a pity I cannot meet your expectations, General Fang. Don't worry. After we capture Jinling City, Zhu Li will be all yours!
movie_512_17=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Wuhen: </font>Marshal, there's an assassin behind you!
movie_512_18=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu'ertuo: </font>You...

movie_512_20=<font color="#ffff00">Ming Army: </font>The enemy Marshal is dead! Hoo!
movie_512_21=<font color="#ffff00">Tartar Military officer: </font>It's awful! The morale of our army has been shaken! We can't take it anymore! Marshal!
movie_512_22=<font color="#ffff00">Liu Fangshuo: </font>Don't panic! Marshal is just injured! Go to protect him while he recovers, and leave it to me.

movie_513_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Hey, there is a dropped letter.
movie_514_1=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Wuhen: </font>Zhu Di. I'll kill your whole family.

movie_515_3=<font color="#ffff00">Yanmen Pass Spy: </font>The Garrison officer has prepared to start an attack. Heroes, come with me to the narrow path and let's sneak into the Tartar Camp.
movie_515_4=<font color="#ffff00">Yanmen Pass Spy: </font>The Tartar leader Lahu Er'tuo will surely assume personal command when the attack starts. In the chaos of battle, don't lose sight of him. Kill him and victory is ours.
movie_515_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Great strategy! Lead the way!

movie_517_3=<font color="#ffff00">Villager: </font>Run! Barbarians are coming!
movie_517_4=<font color="#ffff00">Old Village Head: </font>We finally drove back the enemies, but the Village is... destroyed.

movie_5603_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>How could you be here?
movie_5603_4=<font color="#ffff00">Chen Zhiyong: </font>You released me before, and then I tried everything possible to trace Tusang Bala.
movie_5603_5=<font color="#ffff00">Chen Zhiyong: </font>Eventually I learned of his whereabouts. I followed him to Suzhou, and at the time I intent to move in on him I saw him meet with Wendu Er'han.
movie_5603_6=<font color="#ffff00">Chen Zhiyong: </font>I had a hunch things were that bad, so I didn't start. I overheard their conversation and learned that Wendu Er'han actually was Tusang Bala's master, and that Tusang Bala was just following his instructions.
movie_5603_7=<font color="#ffff00">Chen Zhiyong: </font>At this point I cannot tell anyone. I had committed a capital crime, and once I went back to the Royal Guards I would certainly die. So I had to follow Wendu Er'han instead of Tusang Bala.
movie_5603_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Brother Chen, you have a blood feud with Tusang Bala, haven't you?
movie_5603_9=<font color="#ffff00">Chen Zhiyong: </font>Well to be honest, I struggled at that time. One is my sworn enemy, an? the other is the chief plotter who tried to destroy our Dynasty. So I know what to do.
movie_5603_10=<font color="#ffff00">Chen Zhiyong: </font>I can't thank you enough. Let me help you to eliminate the remaining barriers!
movie_5603_11=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Brother Chen!
movie_5603_12=<font color="#ffff00">Chen Zhiyong: </font>Sorry, I can't help you capture Wendu Er'han. Let me die here, and I will guard our dynasty's frontier.
movie_5603_13=<font color="#ffff00">Chen Zhiyong: </font>Please pass on my message to the Commander. I feel sorry for him and the Royal Guards. I will be a Royal Guard as long as I live. When I pass away one day, I will be a Royal Guard ghost as well!
movie_5603_15=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>What do you want to say?
movie_5603_16=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Tell it to the King of Hell.
movie_5604_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>What's going on?
movie_5604_2=<font color="#ffff00">Emaciated Man: </font>I live nearby, and I come to collect water here every day. I saw him sprinkle some white powder into the water when I came to collect water just now. I tried to stop him, but he actually intended to beat me, and I was no match for him.
movie_5604_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Everything is fine, don't worry. He can do nothing as long as I'm here.
movie_5604_4=<font color="#ffff00">Emaciated Man: </font>If there is nothing else, I will leave. You people scare me to death.
movie_5604_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Who the hell are you? What did you throw into the river?
movie_5604_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>What? You used arsenic? No wonder the people nearby are sick.
movie_5604_9=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>Just sick? You've lost it. Let's settle this with the proper authorities.
movie_5604_11=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Stop!
movie_5604_12=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>This person runs so fast...
movie_5604_13=<font color="#f791ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>This bucket belongs to that villager. Return to the village and give it back to him.
movie_5651_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang: </font>What do you mean, Tang Sigong? Do you know that a group of mysterious people in black attempted to assassinate our Beggar's Sect disciples and even me? I managed to injure the prime culprit, and just then I was rescued by this Xing Junke character.
movie_5651_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang: </font>Those people used your Tangmen's hidden weapon skill. Is this at all related to Tangmen? You'd better hand over Xing Kejun.
movie_5651_4=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Sigong: </font>Leader Xiao, I will explain this to you later. I promise you that we have nothing to do with this matter, but we cannot let you take Xing Junke.
movie_5651_5=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Sigong: </font>Go now, Xing Junke!
movie_5651_6=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang: </font>Elder Tang, I've always respected you as a hero, but what is the meaning of your actions?
movie_5651_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang: </font>Xing Junke has to explain himself.
movie_5651_8=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Sigong: </font>I'm so sorry for you if I do something wrong, but we cannot let you take Xing Junke, Leader.
movie_5652_1=<font color="#ffff00">Tangmen Grandmother Tang: </font>Please, have mercy on us, Leader Xiao.
movie_5652_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang: </font>It is not my real intention, Grandma. Please forgive me if I have displeased you.
movie_5652_3=<font color="#ffff00">Tangmen Grandmother Tang: </font>You speak so bluntly as if to embarrass me, Leader Xiao. This is all just a great big misunderstanding. Tangmen has no intention whatsoever to act against the Beggar's Sect. Someone is trying to make trouble for us.
movie_5652_4=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Sigong: </font>A Traitor in Tangmen was involved in this matter, and we will try our best to find him out and answer for the Beggar's Sect as soon as possible.
movie_5652_5=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang: </font>What should we do about Xing Junke?
movie_5652_6=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Sigong: </font>I'm ashamed to face Leader Xiao about this. I was involved with the child getting injured.
movie_5652_7=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Sigong: </font>You can set your mind at rest, Leader Xiao. I must apologize when I make a thorough investigation of this.
movie_5652_8=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang: </font>You can't do that, Elder Xiao. I cannot bear the responsibility.
movie_5652_9=<font color="#ffff00">Tangmen Grandmother Tang: </font>Please let me explain, Leader Xiao. Don't let the people believe that Tangmen doesn't know the basics of hospitality.
movie_5652_10=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang: </font>Fine, fine, let's go inside and talk.
movie_5652_11=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang: </font>Climb down the mountain to check on Brother Zhu Di, who is injured.

movie_5752_1=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>Excuse me for such an abrupt invitation, Young Master Xing. I know my way of doing things may not be to your liking. Please forgive me, young master.
movie_5752_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Say no more, Miss Mo. Let's enjoy this wine and speak not of such vexing matters. Gosh, this is a strong wine. Is it...
movie_5752_3=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>Oh, you can tell, can you? This is Shaoxing Daughter Red Wine, stored in the great cellar of Zhao Bancheng of Suzhou for twenty years. I went and procured some for you earlier today.
movie_5752_4=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>I couldn't carry the others, so I had to break them. This wine is for you and I only.
movie_5752_5=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Great! According to an old legend, this wine was buried whenever a daughter was born, and would only be dug out on the day of her wedding. For this reason the wine would forever be referred to as the Daughter's Red Wine.
movie_5752_6=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>The wine looks pure, and its fragrance is strong. It's got a heady flavor, at once sweet, sour, bitter, and astringent. Amazing. Judging from the fragrance and color of these jars, it is superlative. I feel honored to drink it with you!
movie_5752_7=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>I know nothing about the manners of wedding ceremony. I am not able to drink more and only can drink little. Please don't mind, young master. Please.
movie_5752_8=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>You flatter me. How could I blame you? Let's have another sip or two.
movie_5752_9=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>The young master at the Pine and Crane Restaurant did me a great favor. I'm most grateful.
movie_5752_10=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>That day I was showing off and made a fool of myself in the tavern. Later I even became more over-confident and brought you much trouble. I am so sorry.
movie_5752_11=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>Lies... A heroic act does not depend on one's age, nor one's skill level. There are too many fake heroes out there, who are in this just for the fame and fortune.
movie_5752_12=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>You are full of ambitions and risk your life at the drop of a hat. There aren't many people like you in this world.
movie_5752_13=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Come now, Miss Mo, surely you jest!
movie_5752_14=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>I didn't believe you at first, though I was quite moved after seeing that you summoned Suzhou's most famous doctor to cure me.
movie_5752_15=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>The doctor looked worried and teary-eyed. With a grave look of concern, he then said that he couldn't do it.
movie_5752_16=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Your face was as white as jade and you didn't need healing. So it wasn't a matter of being treated well. What a pity I was always so anxious. If we meet again one day, please don't trick me again, Miss Mo.
movie_5752_17=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>Young master, let's have a drink. I toast to you!

movie_5752_21=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Miss Mo! I was following orders at the foot of the mountain for a long time and have to go back to report the completed task. I suppose it is time to say goodbye now, and I don't know when we shall meet again.
movie_5752_22=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>No. You must know something and I don't want to hide it any longer. My identity is special. I have lived in Wanderer's Valley and the Leader has always thought highly of me, even regarding me as a saint! I was doomed to give up any prospects of love.
movie_5752_23=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>This is the last time I'll ever leave the valley! No more burdens, no more worries... You are such a great disciple.
movie_5752_24=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>You are a truly outstanding person. There is no need to worry about not having a happily married partner. Let get drunk this one last time and forget each other forever...
movie_5752_25=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Oh don't say that, Miss Mo. My uncouth manners have simply made you worried. Let me drink a bowl in atonement.
movie_5752_26=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>No no, I am the one who has acted with impropriety. Please forgive... say, do you hear that? It sounds like the music of a Qin.
movie_5752_27=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>Yeah, I hear it. It sounds sad...
movie_5752_28=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>This doesn't sound as good as when my younger sister plays it. Though I don't think anyone can match her skills. You should meet her...

movie_5752_32=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>... Young Master Xing, we part ways today, perhaps forever. Do you want to see my true features under this hat?
movie_5752_33=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Well look, we know each other quite well, there's no need to behave like young lovers.
movie_5752_34=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>Please remember that this is my first time to reveal my face to a man. It shall also be the last time.
movie_5752_35=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>Young master... Why not speak? Have I spoiled your fun?
movie_5752_36=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>The gods above would be shamed by your beauty, I am sure.
movie_5752_37=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuyan: </font>There's still plenty of wine left.
movie_5752_38=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>That's it. There is much more wine to drink but if I am drunk, how can I see you on your way? I am sorry.

movie_5803_9=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Yun: </font>I have to speak it out. I want everyone in Tangmen to know about this. No, I want everyone in the world to know. Then Tangmen's reputation won't be worth a steamed bun!
movie_5803_10=Three years ago, I was a Tangmen disciple. One day I met a ragged beggar with one foot in the grave at the base of the mountain. I decided to save him.
movie_5803_11=After Sigong's medicine and my careful attention, he recovered.
movie_5803_12=Later I found he was actually a gifted martial artist. He had an exceptionally deep understanding of Tangmen's martial arts and always gave me pointers. My own fighting skills advanced quickly because of him.
movie_5803_13=Gradually I fell in love with him and wanted to marry him. But then one day he saw the jade plate that my mother gave me...
movie_5803_14=I was detained by Great Mother, who wanted to sentence me to death. I still don't know what I did wrong.
movie_5803_15=At this time, he turned up again and implored Grandma. He was even willing to die on my behalf, and he also offered up a revised copy of the Poison Manual.
movie_5803_16=Grandma agreed and he slashed his throat immediately. I was still detained, but Sigong later snuck in and set me free.
movie_5803_17=Later I threatened Sigong to tell me everything, even if it would cost me my life. How the gods tease us!
movie_5803_18=Oh, him! He was actually my father, Grandma's second son and the younger brother of Tang Tianxing. He was the second young master of the Tang Family, Tang Mubai.
movie_5803_19=More than ten years ago, in spite of Grandma's opposition, he eloped with my mother. Before long I was born, my mother died and he sent me back to Tangmen. Then he ventured off to a faraway place, alone.
movie_5803_20=More than ten years later, he went back to Tangmen but later committed an unspeakable sin with his own daughter.
movie_5803_21=I suppose there are those who are destined for madness. Oh, the dangers of amorous love.
movie_5803_22=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Tianxing: </font>Why not take action?

movie_5806_6=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Yun: </font>Is it?
movie_5806_8=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Yun: </font>We were exploiting each other. As long as I can bring misfortune to Tangmen, life itself is just another cost.
movie_5806_9=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>I can't let you die.
movie_5806_10=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Yun: </font>Do you really care about me or is all you care about Mo Wuqing's whereabouts?

movie_5861_8=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>I didn't tell her. Er...someone knew I was here to heal, and the one told Xiao Man for a special purpose.

movie_5861_13=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuqing: </font>I have observed in secret for a long time, and I think the biggest weakness of this plan was the fact that Elder Martial Sister died of poison.
movie_5861_14=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuqing: </font>If the guess is right, the poison in your dead Elder Martial Sister must be different from the one before it.

movie_5907_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>I can't understand. You've suffered in silence for many years. Even if you wanted to take firearms for yourself, the deaths of those three people wouldn't settle their crimes. Why did you exterminate everyone, killing the whole family?
movie_5907_4=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Zhen: </font>The Shen Qingyun prestige has not come easily. Everything related to Wu Zhen, Fire Cloud Mountain Villa, and that organization must disappear from the world forever!

movie_32_4=<font color="#ffff00">Qingren:</font> You should first master the Seventh Move of Arhat Fist before considering it.
movie_53_1=<font color="#ffff00">Qingneng:</font> Hey, this is it.
movie_53_2=<font color="#ffff00">Qingren:</font> But, but, Elder Martial Brother, it is so close to the Palace. In case. In case we are seen by the Temple-patrolling Martial Elders or Palace-guarding Elder Martial Brothers, then we will. We will.
movie_53_3=<font color="#ffff00">Qingneng:</font> There is nothing to be afraid of. All the people in the temple are now busy at class. Who will be patrolling now? Furthermore, it is not the first time we skipped classes, and we have been lucky each time. I really do not know why you are so timid.
movie_53_4=<font color="#ffff00">Qingren:</font> I, I, I did not.

movie_144_6=<font color="#f795ce">Shaolin Monk:</font> Let me tell you. Sutras from the Tripitaka were stolen. The whole temple is investigating this carefully. We must catch that thief and teach him a lesson.
movie_158_5=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Kui:</font> I do not need to hide this anymore since Wang Zui is dead.
movie_521_1=<font color="#ffff00">Monk:</font> Ahead is the testing grounds. The Shaolin tests are strict that why we have the reputation of being the leader of martial arts in the Central Plains. The elder uncles and brothers in Wooden Monk Lane will not go easy on you. Take care!
movie_521_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I understand.
movie_521_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Zhen:</font> Apart from martial arts training, Shaolin disciples must also train their minds so that we do not lose the essence of being a Buddhist disciple. Also, find Qing Kong inside and bring him out.
movie_521_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I will do as you ask.
movie_523_2=<font color="#ffff00">Grave robber leader:</font> I heard that Shaolin is the leader of martial arts but it's a shame you monks are so stingy. Your martial arts skill scripts are all hidden. Since, I cannot get what I want, I am going to have to take it by force. Haha.
movie_523_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> How dare you thief!? Shaolin marital arts are to strengthen body and mind. We will not allow it to be taken by a robber. You'd better leave, or I will force you to. It won't be a pretty sight.
movie_523_4=<font color="#ffff00">Grave robber leader:</font> Hahaha, a mere youngster would try to stop me!? Since you saw me, don't think you will leave alive.

movie_525_4=<font color="#ffff00">Obscure monk:</font> I'm not busy. The Zen Maze is extremely dangerous. Come spar with me so I can be sure you are powerful enough to go there. You don't need to throw your life away needlessly.
movie_526_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Master, I am most grateful for your kindness. My skills are nothing compared to yours. Thank you very much for allowing me to spar with and thank you for holding back.
movie_526_2=<font color="#ffff00">Obscure monk:</font> Amitabha. It is unusual for a youngster to already hold so many skills. Things can change in the blink of an eye. The road ahead is still long. Please go on ahead.
movie_526_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Master, I thank you for your guide and wisdom.
movie_527_2=<font color="#ffff00">Mad man</font> You disrespectful young thing. I, the Mad Monk, will show you a thing or two today. Don't blame me for picking on you.
movie_528_1=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Zhen:</font> Stand down. This man person is evil and cunning. I will deal with him.
movie_529_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I see... so this is the truth. Elder uncle Madmen, let me help you.
movie_530_2=<font color="#ffff00">Qing Kong:</font> Elder uncle Mad man is right: what goes around comes around. I know now that I am wrong. I will ask for pardon at the Hall of Discipline and from now on I will clear my thoughts and turn my mind to Buddha.
movie_531_1=This is the testing ground that every disciple must pass through - Wooden Monk lane. Wooden Monk Lane was created several hundred years ago by a master of mechanisms and devices. The Wooden man Alertness is one of the monks’ masterpieces.
movie_531_2=Once the test starts, the barriers must first be destroyed. After the time it takes to burn three incense, the wooden man will appear. The more barriers are left in the hall, the more powerful Alertness will be. Do not forget.

movie_558_1=<font color="#ffff00">Hu Yingjie:</font>Lu Zhong of the Rebel Army surrendered to Huyan Xiao. They have taken East Spring Village as their base and are attacking our Urn City. Yanmen Pass is surrounded by enemies. It is very dangerous!

movie_582_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Elder brothers, I am also a Wudang disciple. I am here for the challenge.
movie_582_3=<font color="#ffff00">Disciple Caishi:</font> What? For the challenge!/ We are both Wudang disciples and yet you tell me such nonsense. A young one like you thinks he can learn the upper martial art skills of Wudang? Make your move and we will see what you're made of.
movie_583_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Sir, I am here for,
movie_583_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Master, I welcome your advice.
movie_583_4=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist Yuan Tong:</font> Let's first see if you qualify. First stop, the Circling Dragon Array and then come find me in the middle on the hanging platform.
movie_584_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>,
movie_584_5=<font color="#ffff00">Master Wuwei:</font> When I was young, I thought I was talented and that my martial arts skills would be number one in the world. But elder brother Xuan Zhen was better than me in Palm, Sword and Fist. Naturally, I was not happy.
movie_584_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Oh!? Did sir lose control? It's too dangerous, let me help you stop the pure Yang Chi flow in your body.

movie_586_1=<font color="#ffff00">Master Xuan Zhen:</font> This Wulu Pill was made for the battle that took nine years ago between Wudang and Wanderer's Valley. It was meant to heal the internal injuries of the brothers, but the losses were great from that battle. The pills were not yet ready, but many have already succumbed to their injuries. Now the medicine is still here but those which it was supposed to help are gone. Is this perhaps fate?
movie_586_2=<font color="#ffff01">Master Xuan Zhen:</font> I have gone into retreat for the past several years and have added more ingredients to it. I will try out the effect of this Wuxing Rotation Pill.

I stopped him and forced him to give me the antidote. I have already taken care of the poison for you. I have sent Elder Brother Xiang a message via carrier pigeon. He will be here soon.
movie_587_15=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Hanshan:</font> One of the younger disciples has decent martial arts skills, but he is not that bright. This gate leads directly to Swordsman's Mound of Wudang. It is a secret passage and naturally much better than directly storming Swordsman's Mound.
movie_587_16=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Hanshan:</font> Xuan Zhen and Cangsong might be old but they are highly skilled. If we have to fight, I am not sure of my chances. But if you go it will be different. There are very few masters in Wudang's younger generations. If they see you, they will surely hold back as you have got great potential.
movie_587_17=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Hanshan:</font> You really do have great martial arts potential and have managed to get through all six gates. I didn't think it would go so smoothly, it really did go quite easily. Haha.
movie_589_5=<font color="#ffff00">Xiang Jiuchen:</font> Let me take Younger Brother Sang back to the great hall and see what our grandmaster decides. {@0:}, as for training, come find me afterward at the great hall.

movie_705_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang:</font> What? You are the one who killed Vice Leader Gao!
movie_705_3=<font color="#ffff00">Commander of Lord Zhu's guards:</font> Chuan Jixing did quite well, and you will not be able to defeat XiaoTianfang. Leave it to us.
movie_705_4=<font color="#ffff00">Chuan Zhixing:</font> A mere letter crushed Beggar's Sect. Lord Zhu is indeed cunning, haha.
movie_705_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> So you were behind all this? You need to go past me if you want to kill our Leader.
movie_706_1=<font color="#ffff00">Commander of Lord Zhu's guards:</font> We will leave it to you now. Don't disappoint Lord Zhu.
movie_706_2=<font color="#ffff00">Chuan Zhixing:</font> Yes sir.
movie_707_5=<font color="#ffff00">Xie Guangkuan:</font> Xiao Tianfang murdered Vice Leader Gao. I will rip him apart from limb to limb.
movie_707_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> It was Chuan Jixing who murdered Vice Leader Gao for personal gain and then blamed it on our Leader. The traitor is already in my hands.
movie_708_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I was played a fool by Chuan Jixing and hurt Helm Masters by mistake. Now the truth has uncovered and I have killed that traitor, Leader Xiao asked me to come rescue Helm Masters.
movie_708_3=<font color="#ffff00">Da Zhi:</font> You hurt me first and now rescue me. What is the meaning of this? Where is our Leader now? let's go assist him!
movie_709_2=<font color="#ffff00">Lord Zhu:</font> Xiao Tianfang, I have admired you for long.
movie_709_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang:</font> Apricot Forest is <font color="#ff0000">surrounded by mountains</font>. Each entrance is guarded by Beggar's Sect disciples. How did you get in here?
movie_709_5=<font color="#ffff00">Lord Zhu:</font> If Chuan Jixing didn't help me, I would have found it difficult to overcome so many experts in Beggar's Sect, haha.
movie_709_6=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang:</font> I neglected to see the traitor and led trouble to Beggar's Sect.
movie_709_8=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang:</font> Beggar's Sect is known for loyalty and chivalry. We will not participate in torture.
movie_710_1=<font color="#ffff00">Da Ren:</font> {@0:}, we are here to help you.
movie_711_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Tell us, where did your Lord Zhu take our School Leader Xiao?
movie_711_2=<font color="#ffff00">Yun Qingxing:</font> Don't kill me, I'll tell you... Lord Zhu planned on taking them to Lord Jing's residence tomorrow morning. It's late in the night so they have set up camp just a little further ahead. Please...don't kill me.
movie_712_4=<font color="#ffff00">Lord Zhu:</font> XiaoTianfang is there. Kill them. You are merely my arms and hands.
movie_712_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Shut up I {@0:} will never commit so foul a deed. Die you scoundrel!
movie_712_6=<font color="#ffff00">Lord Zhu:</font> Are you blind? You think you are able to hurt me? You can collect Xiao Tianfang's corpse.
movie_713_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang:</font> Wait. If it was not for this disciple's help, I would have died already. Enforcement Elders, I ask for your mercy.
movie_713_5=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang:</font> You know you have made a mistake and learned from it {@0:}. You were also lied to by Chuan Jixing. The fact that you offered yourself when there was danger, {@0:} you were able to come out and try to mend the damages so that Beggar's Sect is now safe and the citizens do not have to go through the pain of civil war.
movie_713_8=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang:</font> But,
movie_713_9=<font color="#ffff00">Enforcement Elders:</font> {@0:} You have transgressed against many rules and should have been cast out. But, as your good deeds count in your favor, we have decided that one will cancel out the other. You may remain within Beggar's Sect.
movie_713_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> My deepest thanks for your faith in me {@0:}. I will be more careful in the future and will not give others a chance to use me.
movie_716_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I have killed Duan Manying, but Helm Master Da Ren has been injured.
movie_716_3=<font color="#ffff00">Four Helm Masters:</font> Hmm, {@0:}, get ready. We are going up the mountain right away.
movie_765_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Tianzheng:</font> It is ridiculous! Hahaha... cough... this is turn around, I never thought I'd die by your hand... Father, I was not able to avenge you. I was not able to rebuild Tianji Hall... Father, I am coming to see you now.
movie_765_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> How could this be?
movie_770_2=<font color="#ffff01">Tang Meijiao:</font> Would Elder Tang Chen please take him to the Road of Nine Thoughts and feed him to the snakes and scorpions?
movie_770_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> No, no, no. Second Lady Tang, you are mistaken. I am here to catch the thief Qian Bofei, he,
movie_770_6=<font color="#ffff01">Tang Meijiao:</font> <font color="#00FFFF">(This fellow must have come with that country bumpkin. If I let him go, he will go straight to grandmother). </font>
movie_773_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Elder, I am here to catch the traitor Qian Bofei. He stole Grandmother's pass so he can go to Tangmen's secret chamber. Please, let me go so I can go apprehend him.
movie_773_3=<font color="#ffff01">Tang Xingya:</font> He has a stolen token? Why should I believe you? You have a Tangmen pass token!?
movie_773_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Well... well... it as an emergency and I was not able to get one from Grandmother or Master.
movie_773_5=<font color="#ffff01">Tang Xingya:</font> If you do not have a Tangmen pass or a token form Grandmother? I cannot let you pass. If you insist on going through, I will not have any mercy.
movie_774_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Thief where do you think you are going?
movie_778_7=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Tianxing:</font> {@0:} You were able to eradicate the last of Tianji Hall on behalf of Tangmen, which was quite a remarkable deed. Yet you were not able to guard the Vice Hall Leader, and you went into the Thousand Poison Palace without permission. It seems your good deed will cancel out your transgressions! Your martial arts skills have improved much more rapidly than I expected. Your trip to the Thousand Poison Palace means you have passed the school test. We hope that in the future you will continue to do your best for our school and live up to your full potential.
movie_781_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Good, take care of yourself.
movie_782_3=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Junlei:</font> What misunderstanding could there possibly be? You are here for the Treasure of Tangmen.
movie_783_1=<font color="#ffff00">Jianghu person:</font> Cough, cough... Young Hero, thank you for rescuing me.
movie_783_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> What happened here? Why are you so badly injured?
movie_783_3=<font color="#ffff00">Jianghu person:</font> This is what happened.
movie_783_4=<font color="#ffff00">Jianghu person:</font> We heard that Ming Jiao left something in the Tangmen forbidden instance so we thought we would go take a look.
movie_783_5=<font color="#ffff00">Jianghu person:</font> We had successfully infiltrated the Road of Nine Thoughts, but who knew,
movie_783_6=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Chen:</font> There is no need to hide, the Thousand Poison Palace is not somewhere where you rats can enter. Babbling about loyalty and chivalry, you are only here for the Treasure of Tangmen! Defeat me first, and we will see. (Another group? I've lost count of how many groups have come here to throw away their lives)
movie_783_7=<font color="#ffff00">Jianghu person:</font> We were discovered by the cursed Tang Chen and fell into his trap. His men were everywhere.
movie_784_1=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Su:</font> You inexperienced things were able to come all the way here to where I am. Impressive.
movie_784_3=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Su:</font> Hmph! You are here for the fragment of the Tapestry. Don't think I don't know that!
movie_784_5=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Su:</font> I don't want to hear anymore. All robbers have been imprisoned here. If you want to get the treasure, you need to check first that you actually can.
movie_784_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Forgive me. (The treasure is maybe hidden on his him. Let me kill him first)
movie_826_2=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Xiaolan:</font> Fine, don't give it to me!
movie_826_5=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Xiaolan:</font> Elder Brother Yun {@0:}, without passing my challenge, it doesn't count as passing the test. {@0:}, you think with the experience token, you can get what you want from here?
movie_830_6=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Yun:</font> But you, who knows when we will meet again when we part today.
movie_833_1=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Yao:</font> Very well. You have passed the challenge. Here is your experience token.
movie_834_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Yao:</font> I asked the housekeeper to wait outside. Go to him for the experience tokens.
movie_840_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Yao:</font> It is a shame. Your martial arts skills are good but you have very little understanding of finer things. This means that you are an impatient person. If you pass the challenge like this, I am afraid it will damage our school's reputation.
movie_840_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Yao:</font> I am but mediocre in the healing arts, but I have this healing potion which will help you. It will take a long time to heal. If you still want to pass the test, you need to learn music, art, chess and then maybe come back again later.
movie_841_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Hey! I am here. Give me my experience token.
movie_841_4=<font color="#ffff00">Lady:</font> Haha, I thought you wanted the experience token. Defeat me first.
movie_884_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Is there something else going on here? Oh well, if the General gave the orders, then this person must die. Captain is far away from here. Ding Xiaoshan can't get too far. I must go immediately and complete the mission.
movie_885_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> No, General cannot be wrong. As a Royal Guard, I should not question General's commands. Never mind. Let me go catch Yue Zhipeng.
movie_887_6=<font color="#ffff01">Shen Hao:</font> I found many suspicious points in the evidence. I suspect the new chancellor of Ministry of War and the eunuchs of East Chamber have been working together to put the blame on General Yue. There must be some conspiracy in all this.
movie_887_10=<font color="#ffff01">Shen Hao:</font> General Yue, you don't need to explain yourself. I understand now. It appears that the eunuchs of East Chamber are plotting something. General Yue, you should leave. This place is no longer safe.
movie_887_16=<font color="#ffff01">Yue Zhipeng:</font> Thank you for understanding! The traitors have the court in power and have hidden justice. I will not rest easy. I cannot avenge Lord Yang. I will leave now. We will meet again.
movie_890_4=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Honglie:</font> Lies! You let a prisoner go without orders! What do you have to say for yourself? Where is Shen Hao?
movie_895_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> This temple is very strange. The north east corner looks a little weird as well. Maybe it's a hidden mechanism!
movie_896_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> It looks like this place is full of hidden traps and devices... This is the "Lost Soul Path" where the arrows pass... Gate of Hell, Lost Soul Path, Flaming Prisons, the River of Death—there is no return from Frozen Hell.
movie_896_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I heard that the mechanisms here are laid out in the Nine Palace system, so the Nine Palace Order must be followed. If I step on one, then the next step must be on two and so forth. If I make a wrong move, a rain of arrows will be released and I will die here.
movie_897_1=<font color="#ffff00">??? :</font> Haha, another group of idiots.
movie_897_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Who are you to say such things? Tell us who you are?
movie_897_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Canfeng:</font> Haha, Jianghu youngsters have no manners. Who do you think you are to order me around? You trespassed into The Purgatory and you have never heard of me, Zhao Canfeng?
movie_897_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Canfeng:</font> Ha, there's no need for such surprise. You don't have much time left on this earth. Leave some surprise for your last words.
movie_897_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Canfeng:</font> People of Jianghu will fight over any baseless rumor. They seem to enjoy being tricked. What fools.
movie_897_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Zhao Canfeng, words are only words. Show us what you're made of.
movie_897_7=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Canfeng:</font> Since you know no better, I will gladly oblige you.
movie_899_2=<font color="#ffff00">East Chamber:</font> You idiot... you will get to experience my Eight Diagrams Dragon Prison Array. To die by my hands is quite an honor.
movie_900_1=<font color="#ffff00">East Chamber:</font> ...It can't be, it can't be! Just one more step. My skills are unparalleled and to lose to some nobody!
movie_900_3=<font color="#ffff00">East Chamber:</font> Just one more step, just one more step... I don't believe it, it's not fair! Hahah die! Die and be buried with me.
movie_901_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I will not let your sacrifice be I vain, I will complete Brother Shen's request.
movie_906_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> The color of the water is unnatural. There must be something wrong with it!
movie_906_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I remember now, "Lost Soul Path" where the arrows pass... Gate of Hell, Lost Soul Path, Flaming Prisons, the River of Death—there is no return from Frozen Hell..." This is the River of Hell. The water is cold beyond your imagination and will corrode wounds. I must be careful.
movie_911_1="Splendid Country, Fight for the Throne, Eight Pictures Become One, The Country must be in Chaos."
movie_911_4=<font color="#f790ce">Citizen:</font> Attack!
movie_911_7=<font color="#f790ce">Citizen:</font> It does not appear that a direct attack will work.
movie_911_8=<font color="#f790ce">Citizen:</font> There is a waterway that will lead to the Gate of Hell.
movie_911_9=<font color="#f790ce">Citizen:</font> Let's attack from the waterway.
movie_911_10=<font color="#f790ce">Citizen:</font> Ready!
movie_911_11=<font color="#f790ce">Citizen:</font> Go!
movie_941_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> It's darker in front. Could there be someone hiding?
movie_941_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> What's that sound?
movie_941_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Who's there? Show yourself!
movie_941_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I must find out.
movie_941_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> It's dark here and there is a humming noise. There must be some monster hidden within. I will have to use the Eagle Eye stone to reveal it.
movie_942_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Who's there?
movie_942_2=<font color="#ffff00">Demon:</font> Haha, hahaha... You're finally here.
movie_942_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Are you the second-in-Command of the Ghost Altar, Demon?
movie_942_4=<font color="#ffff00">Demon:</font> It is I. The Buddha Guardian and the Ghost Altar are enemies. Last time you helped the Buddha Guardian steal Yinyang Grass from Ghost Altar. Today, I will show you our hospitality!
movie_942_5=<font color="#ffff00">Demon:</font> Haha do not be afraid. Soon, you will die painlessly.
movie_943_1=<font color="#ffff00">Worm Guardian:</font> Hahaha, my worm babies are about to hatch. You are lucky today. Leave now!
movie_943_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> The Worm Guardian is on the path. If the worms are born, there is no chance of my success.
movie_943_3=<font color="#ffff00">Worm Guardian:</font> What are you mumbling about? Are you trying to wreck my ritual?
movie_943_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> The Worm Guardian and the giant worms are hidden in the ring of flames. I can't get close at all.
movie_943_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Oh, this four-sided flag is reflecting sunlight on to the giant worms to provide energy. If I destroy the flag, the worms will not hatch.
movie_943_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Let me see the skills of the Worm Guardian.
movie_943_7=<font color="#f790ce">Worm Guardian:</font> Hmph! I knew you were trouble. Come out children, time to eat.
movie_944_1=<font color="#ffff00">Corpse Queen:</font> Hmm, you actually managed to get here. It appears that Dan Wuliang did not underestimate you. See how I am going to deal with you!
movie_944_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> This woman is all talk.
movie_944_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I remember now. You are the second-in-command of the Corpse Altar, Corpse Queen. Your martial arts skills are extremely powerful. You kill without blinking and you feed on fresh Blood and rotting meat.
movie_944_4=<font color="#ffff00">Corpse Queen:</font> Hmph! So I am still remembered by some. Kneel for forgiveness now, and I will grant you an un-mutilated corpse. Hahaha!
movie_945_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> All the other altars sent their second-in-command to guard the Cavern of Lost Souls. Why did the Buddha Guardian come himself?
movie_945_2=<font color="#ffff00">Buddha Guardian:</font> There is someone waiting to trap you. If you go, you will die. For the sake of Wanderer's Valley, I am here to prevent you and Shan Chong from going!
movie_945_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Buddha Guardian, you have too little faith in me! I don't care what great danger lies ahead. I will help Elder Brother Dan pass his test. So we can go for revenge!
movie_945_4=<font color="#ffff00">Buddha Guardian:</font> You are going to force your way through? You cannot win against me.
movie_945_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Whether or not I can win we will only know if I try. Forgive me for being rash.
movie_945_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Oh!
movie_945_7=<font color="#ffff00">Buddha Guardian:</font> Hmph! You overestimate yourself!
movie_945_8=<font color="#ffff00">Buddha Guardian:</font> This sword is the treasure of my Altar. It is the king of swords. It has been forged from the cold steel from the poles, and it is incredibly hard and has got innate abilities. If you can break it, I will let you pass.
movie_945_9=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> What good would that do?
movie_946_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I have broken the giant sword. Can I go through now?
movie_946_3=<font color="#ffff00">Buddha Guardian:</font> You are not as unskilled as I feared. I can let you go forward now. I never break my promise. You broke my giant sword so you are free to go. Go!
movie_946_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Many thanks!
movie_946_5=<font color="#ffff00">Shan Chong:</font> I have finally caught up.
movie_946_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Shan Chong, you missed all the good parts. I have gone past the 5 Guardians. Once I get past the Shura King, the test is over. Don't give up now!
movie_948_1=<font color="#ffff00">Dan Wuliang:</font> The relentless power is truly strong! Don't worry, I strike quickly. You will not feel a thing.
movie_948_3=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Hu:</font> Our Valley leader is aware of your treachery and has asked me to wait for you here. He said that you cannot defeat me. Even if you have the Relentless Blade, you are still useless.
movie_948_6=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Hu:</font> Shan Tianming, you have great potential but you were too lazy to train and tried to take shortcuts to achieve your goals. In the end, you sought the help of unique weapons.
movie_948_7=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Hu:</font> For twelve years, we have been training tirelessly, but for twelve years you have let your skills go to waste. You never understood the tenet that not training means getting worse. No you are the pitiful one!
movie_948_9=<font color="#ffff01">Wu Hu:</font> Shan Chong, take the Relentless Blade and leave. Wanderer's Valley does not suit you.
movie_949_5=The first few challenges in the cave had representatives from Ghost Altar, Worm Altar, Poison Altar, and Corpse Altar, and at the back are Buddha Guardian's men and the Shura King. When the disciples of Wanderer's valley need to pass their test, they need to first successfully run this gauntlet.
movie_952_2=<font color="#ffff00">Dan Wuliang:</font> Hmph! You've been hiding there for quite a while now, reveal yourself! Do you not know this is Elder Uncle's retreat? Trespassers will be punished.
movie_952_7=<font color="#ffff00">Dan Wuliang:</font> Being a disciple of Wanderer's Valley means you need to be on your guard at all times. Godfather just wanted to teach this person a lesson. Who knew it would be so useless.
movie_952_8=<font color="#ffff00">Shan Chong:</font> Godfather, this lowly disciple was only here on his master's request. He did not mean to trespass on your private retreat. Please forgive him.
movie_1019_5=<font color="#ffff00">Madame Shen: </font> Fortunately Qingyun tried hard to save me. Only then was I able to escape with my life. From then on, the servants thought the Shen Family strange. They left, one after the other.

movie_5251_2=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Xia:</font> Young Hero, please do not blame me. I followed you secretly because I was so worried and could not concentrate, although you told me to stay at home and waited for Ke Jun's message.

movie_772_3=<font color="#ffff00">Qian Bofei:</font> This is the token. Please have a look.

movie_772_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Don't listen to him, predecessor. He stole the token from Grandma, and I come here to capture him.

movie_769_8=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Meiyan:</font> You are lying! I saw you attacked me! If you don't surrender now, I will kill you!
movie_770_1=<font color="#ffff01">Tang Meijiao:</font> Ah! He is too weak. I hurt the man sent by Grandma, so she must blame me. I'd better drag him to Nine Inflexions Thought Road to feed the snakes and scorpions, and pretend that I never saw him. Whee…
movie_770_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Nice to meet you, second lady.
movie_770_4=<font color="#ffff01">Tang Meijiao:</font> Who are you? Are you with him?

movie_763_5=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Lan:</font> Grandma treated you well, why did you betray us?
movie_763_6=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Qing:</font> I am devoid of gratitude, so what? Do I need to remember other's favor when I become the leader? At the moment, everyone in Tang Family Castle treats me with a double part! Then who will respect me when Grandma die later?
movie_763_7=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Qing:</font> So I will act first. When I get the treasure, nobody can match me anymore! I will be the leader of Tang Family Castle!

movie_588_10=<font color="#ffff00">Sang Shuyun:</font> I never thought these guys were so weak. How can I revenge for my family if I cannot get scripts and cultivate kung fu? Now my secret is exposed, and I cannot let them leave alive.
movie_588_11=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Heng:</font> Why are you doing this? I didn't want Wanderer's Valley to fight a war against Wudang, so I imprisoned myself here. Young one, you need to put down your weapon and forget your hatred…
movie_588_12=<font color="#ffff00">Sang Shuyun:</font> Shut up! You are too stubborn! Then I have to do it myself! I will kill your daughter first, then kill all of you!

movie_647_7=<font color="#ffff00">Abbess Mieyuan:</font> Em! I saw your martial sister Jueyou grow up, but I didn't expect she to do such shameful thing! It's good to spare life, that's why I didn't eliminate the evil root.

movie_654_3=She was bullied and ridiculed by everyone. She hate this world, hate all unfairness, and she hated her apretns even more.
movie_654_4=She swear that she will find her parents and question them why they gave birth to her and abandon her…
movie_654_5=Rootless grass, with no one to care, when the wind blows, where will it ends? With sad life, useless in living with hope, where is dad and where is mom?

movie_948_10=All have ended. Shan Chong took down the silver lock, opened it, and saw a piece of paper:
movie_948_11=Great perfection seems flawed, yet function without a hitch. Great fullness seems empty, yet functione without exhaustion. Great straigtness seems crooked, great skill seems clumsy, great eloquence seem stammering. Excitement overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat. Clarity and Stillness set everything right.

movie_5460_1=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>Boss Tao, our business isn't finished yet. Why you are in a hurry to leave?
movie_5460_2=<font color="#ffff00">Tao Baisui: </font>Master, let's not mention about the trade. It's a letter from Qiu Sheng, and I ought to hand it to you without a second's thought.
movie_5460_3=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>These pages are letters from Qiu Sheng, which mention an incident involving a dragon boat that happened fifteen years ago. They are of immeasurable value. Boss Tao is called the top collector in the central plains. He doesn't bow to just anyone.
movie_5460_4=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>Boss Tao said that we must be insane, to offer a treasure from the Eight Schools in exchange. He was onto something, though…
movie_5460_5=<font color="#ffff00">Tao Baisui: </font>I deserve to die. I blame myself for offending your guild. Please have mercy on me, Master...
movie_5460_6=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>...But while we were spending all this time getting the treasures for you, you were running away and leaving all your assets behind. Would a friend do this?
movie_5460_7=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>Since you treat your wealth as mere dirt, you wouldn't mind if I set a fire and burn all your treasures and wife and mistresses, would you?
movie_5460_8=<font color="#ffff00">Tao Baisui: </font>Have mercy! I admit it's my fault; I shouldn't have sent people to investigate your guild! I swear that I'll change my ways from now on and will not say anything, and I will not enter the Central Plains as long as I live.
movie_5460_9=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>You won't say anything... Ha! Everyone says that Tao Baisui is very greedy. I almost forgot that a person who collects rare treasures all over the world must have extraordinary ability to gather information as well.
movie_5460_10=<font color="#ffff00">Tao Baisui: </font>I will cut off my tongue and dig out my eyes. I only beg Young Hall Leader to consider my old age and allow me to live.
movie_5460_11=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>Boss Tao, you are very resourceful. Now that you know who we are...
movie_5460_12=<font color="#ffff00">Tao Baisui: </font>Do you really have to kill everyone? Don't you want to get back the secret letter that Ding Jiuzhong left with Feng Fei and her son?
movie_5460_13=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>Have you read it?
movie_5460_14=<font color="#ffff00">Tao Baisui: </font>That's right. Aside from the mother and son, I am the only person who knows what's written in the letter. Out of respect for Ding Jiuzhong, I have arranged for someone I trust to escort Feng Fei and her son to safety.
movie_5460_15=<font color="#ffff00">Tao Baisui: </font>I'll tell you Feng Fei and her son's whereabouts if you don't kill me.
movie_5460_16=<font color="#ffff00">Tao Baisui: </font>This is impossible. I... How could she betray me?
movie_5460_17=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>Your beloved 18th mistress took Feng Fei to seek protection from me. In order to please me, she told me everything in bed.
movie_5460_18=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>Since you like her so much, why don't you go find her?
movie_5460_19=<font color="#ffff00">Tao Baisui: </font>You! You...
movie_5460_20=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>Where's the letter?
movie_5460_21=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Fei: </font>It was burned.
movie_5460_22=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>What did it say in the letter?
movie_5460_23=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>You son is very cute. Would he tell me?
movie_5460_24=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Fei: </font>He's from the Ding family, and is not a coward.
movie_5460_25=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>What would he do if he sees his mother being mistreated?
movie_5460_26=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Fei: </font>Beast!
movie_5460_27=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>Mistress is even more beautiful than ever. No women in the world can compare with your beauty.
movie_5460_28=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Fei: </font>Alright. Let me talk to my son in private. I'll tell you after we are finished.
movie_5460_29=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Fei: </font>Son, would you like your mother to take you to your father?

movie_5460_31=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>Do you know who they are?
movie_5460_32=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>They are cultists! When they were defeated all those years ago, most of their followers became bandits to wait for the day they would rise again. That letter may just be the thing for them to restart a war.
movie_5460_33=<font color="#ffff00">Young Hall Leader: </font>Compared with the lives of many, the lives of one or two are nothing.

movie_5607_1=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Cangfeng: </font>I have lived for fame and money. It's actually a relief to die. Thank you!
movie_5607_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Why did you join the Royal Guards after you were captured?
movie_5607_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Cangfeng: </font>The East Chamber Master was consolidating his power. He invited me to join the Royal Guards after seeing my skills. He promised me power and riches.
movie_5607_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Cangfeng: </font>My life was in great danger back then, so I said yes to his request. But he was afraid I would betray him, so he castrated me. He freed Ling Long, then threatened to kill her if I didn't obey him.

movie_5607_9=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Cangfeng: </font>Ling Long was just a baby when I found her in the grass. I was only 8 years old that year. I raised her by picking up garbage and performing in the streets. We depended on each other.
movie_5607_10=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Cangfeng: </font>It's fortunate that Ling Long didn't let me down and learned great martial skills. She was our best student when she was just 12 years old. The elders said that her future would be immeasurable.
movie_5607_11=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Cangfeng: </font>But... a man called Lao Daozi did something to her. She wanted to die after that, and only promised not to kill herself when I threatened to kill myself.

movie_4165_2=<font color="#f794ce">Xi Chi:</font> Silence! The Ayin of before was the world's most foolish woman. Foolish enough to just wait to someone to toss everything overboard to come back to her. She's already dead! You don't deserve to mention her name!
movie_4165_3=<font color="#f790ce">Man:</font> You're too extreme...
movie_4165_4=<font color="#f794ce">Xi Chi:</font> You're wrong. Now, I see everything clearly. I created Palace of Shifting Flowers to save all of the women blinded by men. In your eyes, women are worth no more than a sword, a script, or your precious Jianghu morals. In my eyes, they are half of the sky, half of the earth, and half of life! You hypocrites don't deserve them.
movie_4165_5=<font color="#f790ce">Man:</font> Even if I did neglect you because of Jianghu morals, remember who you killed! You murdered my elder martial brother, my benefactor's only daughter and my sworn brother! What did they do wrong? Why couldn't you spare them!

movie_569_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>General Fang, to be honest, there is another reason why we have been willing to make such compromises and act like dogs.
movie_569_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>After gaining power in the War of Jingnan, Zhu Di went on a killing spree; we are all descendants of the loyal people that he killed, and for all these years, we have been searching for the right opportunity to re-establish our country.

We are acting as though we are surrendering to the enemy, when in reality, we are trying to get Zhu Di to lead his army to battle in person, and then wait for the opportunity to kill him, re-establish Emperor Jianwen, and restore the real Ming Dynasty.

movie_569_15=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Pingting: </font>That day, I went with our sister and mother to jump into the river, but because of a fortuitous line of events, I was saved by a martial arts master, I later learned a great deal of martial arts skills.
movie_569_16=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Pingting: </font>Zhu Di is our family's arch enemy. My goal in life is to seek revenge. I hid in Lord Jing's Mansion waiting for an opportunity and also to try to obtain information about where you were.
movie_569_17=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Pingting: </font>A few days ago I was transporting a prisoner to Yanmen Pass, and happened to see your name in the troop manifest. I was shocked, and after some asking around, I found it indeed was you.

movie_569_20=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Pingting: </font>For our home and for our country, we must not allow the fake Emperor Zhu Di to get away with his crimes. After a while at the border, you changed your name to "Wuhen" (meaning "let go of hate"), are you planning to forget about what happened to us, our family, and our country?!
movie_569_21=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Wuhen: </font>Sister...you are right...I was wrong.
movie_569_22=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Pingting: </font>We have not seen each other for such a long time, if it were under different circumstances, we would surely have drunk wine and celebrated. We do not have much time, I am sure Liu Fangshuo will come in person to negotiate a surrender. You can pretend to agree and allow him to fold our rebel forces into his own forces. We will then act when the opportunity comes!

movie_570_3=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Wuhen: </font>Marshal, you are too kind! After you!
movie_570_4=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu Ertuo: </font>Everyone, today, by occupying Yanmen Pass, we have sought revenge for what has happened to us for the past several decades. The Gold Family names will once again cover this land!!
movie_570_5=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu Ertuo: </font>However, some people do not think this way. Bring the assassin!
movie_570_6=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Wuhen: </font>(Sister! Why do you want to assassinate Lahu Ertuo?)
movie_570_7=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu Ertuo: </font>These people are faking a surrender in order to attempt an assassination. I easily saw through these simple tricks. Ha ha, it is said that the people of the Central Plains are intelligent and strategic. It doesn't seem like it!
movie_570_8=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu Ertuo: </font>However, no matter how I interrogate them, or how I try to bribe them, they still refuse to admit to what they did as well as refuse to give up their accomplices, and choose to end their own lives. That is actually quite admirable. What do you think, General Fang?
movie_570_9=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Wuhen: </font>(Lahu Ertuo suspects me?) Marshal, you are right.
movie_570_10=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu Ertuo: </font>I hear that Zhu Di is personally leading 300 thousand troops into battle and will soon reach Yanmen Pass. Everything is as anticipated by you, Mr. Advisor.
movie_570_11=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu Ertuo: </font>Pass down my order, first thing tomorrow morning, register these people into our troops, remove the camp, and head back to the plains!
movie_570_12=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Wuhen: </font>(Retreating? Oh no!) Marshal! Yanmen Pass has been occupied, we should take advantage of this opportunity and march into the Capitol. Why are you retreating?
movie_570_13=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu Ertuo: </font>General Fang, you must be joking. You have been at the borders for so long, how could you not understand this? The Mongolians are not familiar with battles in cities. Therefore, coming into the Central Plains to expand is inefficient for us and we will inevitably be defeated. This is not the correct way for us to survive.
movie_570_14=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu Ertuo: </font>In order to win over the Central Plains, it is more important for us to defeat the army rather than occupy land. Yanmen Pass has been destroyed, which means that there is no longer a border fortress to rely on. Our troops can enter the Central Plains at any time. Obviously Zhu Di will attack me
movie_570_15=<font color="#ffff00">Lahu Ertuo: </font>Pulling back our troops at this time will make their soldiers arrogant, and they will think that they are invincible. We will then draw them into the desert, cut off their supplies, and them surround them and attack them from all sides.

movie_570_19=<font color="#ffff00">Liu Fangshuo: </font>Marshal, it is said that this woman is the sister of General Fang.

movie_570_21=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Wuhen: </font>... (My sister must have found out about their plan and knew that seeking revenge in this manner would not be good, which is why she decided to attempt an assassination. Lahu Ertuo you pretentious rascal!)

movie_570_23=<font color="#ffff00">Fang Wuhen: </font>... (Killing Zhu Di would indeed be good, but would you be willing to hand the Central Plains to a foreign tribe in order to achieve that? My sister made her decision, what should I do?)

movie_3006_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yifei:</font> We let you think that you accidentally killed Xue Chen, while we turn the kid in for the reward.
movie_3008_1=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Loukai's Underling:</font> Master Ye.
movie_3008_2=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Loukai:</font> Have you found Zhao Ziji's whereabouts?
movie_3008_3=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Loukai's Underling:</font> Yes. Zhao Ziji has been hiding in Twilight Village all these years. In order to deceive prying eyes, he married a local woman and is living as a recluse in Twilight Village.
movie_3008_4=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Loukai's Underling:</font> Sir, we're the first ones to find out where Zhao Ziji is, why don't we...
movie_3008_5=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Loukai:</font> No. Back then, the Han family tried to surround and take him down but he broke through, killing many of their men and beheaded Han Sijing. He's not someone we can take on.
movie_3008_6=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Loukai:</font> The Han family has put a heavy bounty on Zhao Ziji's head and many Jianghu masters are getting restless. Well, if the reward is high enough there will be people brave enough to take on the risk, but Zhao Ziji isn't someone to be taken lightly.
movie_3008_7=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Loukai:</font> Go, tell everyone where Zhao Ziji is and let them lead the charge and then... Ha ha! We'll swoop down and snatch up the reward.
movie_3008_8=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Loukai's Underling:</font> Brother, you are very wise!
movie_3009_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Ha ha ha... Give me another drink! I'm not drunk yet, keep those drinks coming...
movie_3009_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Eh... Yue Ru, why are you here alone? Where is Master Chang?
movie_3009_3=<font color="#ffff00">Le Ru:</font> Brother Chang's been pulled away for drinks.
movie_3009_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> More wine... Let's drink...
movie_3009_5=<font color="#ffff00">Le Ru:</font> Look at you. You've had too much.
movie_3009_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Le Ru, why did you change out of your wedding dress? I thought... you looked really pretty in your wedding dress...
movie_3009_7=<font color="#ffff00">Le Ru:</font> Really? I've heard people mention that playing tricks in the nuptial chamber is really fun, but what a pity Brother Chang doesn't want to…
movie_3009_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> It's fine... I'm here for you...
movie_3009_9=<font color="#ffff00">Le Ru:</font> Okay! Tee hee... Then you should change into these clothes
movie_3009_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Uh... I guess... It's acceptable?
movie_3009_11=<font color="#ffff00">Le Ru:</font> It's fine! Come on over here.
movie_3009_12=<font color="#ffff00">Le Ru:</font> Let's dance!

movie_3010_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I'm…not drunk…give me another drink…
movie_3010_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Eh... Erxia, why are you here? Where is Master Chang and Le Ru?
movie_3010_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Erxia:</font> They've gone to have drinks with the guests.
movie_3010_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Drink…I need more drink…
movie_3010_5=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Erxia:</font> Look at you, you've had too much.
movie_3010_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Huh, Master Chang and Le Ru's wedding dresses are here. Erxia, have you ever heard that playing tricks in the nuptial chamber is fun?
movie_3010_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Erxia:</font> I think I have.
movie_3010_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Come on, let's change into these clothes.
movie_3010_9=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Erxia:</font> Errrr... Is this... appropriate?
movie_3010_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> It's fine. Let's dance.
movie_3010_11=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Erxia:</font> ...
movie_3010_12=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Ha ha ha...
movie_3011_1=<font color="#ffff00">Chang Shanzhao:</font> Oh, stop with the act! If you have something to say, then let's hear it.
movie_3011_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Look who this is, Chang!
movie_3011_3=<font color="#ffff00">Le Ru ({@IDName:Player}):</font> Chang, why do you want to kill me?
movie_3011_4=<font color="#ffff00">Chang Shanzhao:</font> ...
movie_3011_5=<font color="#ffff00">Le Ru ({@IDName:Player}):</font> You and I are husband and wife, why did you treat me like this?
movie_3011_6=<font color="#ffff00">Chang Shanzhao:</font> You, you, you...
movie_3011_7=<font color="#ffff00">Chang Shanzhao:</font> Are you alive or dead?
movie_3011_8=<font color="#ffff00">Le Ru ({@IDName:Player}):</font> Why did you treat me like this? Why did you kill me?
movie_3011_9=<font color="#ffff00">Chang Shanzhao:</font> No...
movie_3011_10=<font color="#ffff00">Chang Shanzhao:</font> I didn't kill you on purpose, I swear!!!
movie_3012_1=<font color="#ffff00">??? :</font> Go back to the valley, you lackey!
movie_3012_2=<font color="#ffff00">Suspicious Person:</font> If I can't get away, then I'll fight to the death today!
movie_3012_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Erxia:</font> Stop! Don't hurt the lady!
movie_3012_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Erxia:</font> Miss...
movie_3012_5=<font color="#ffff00">??? :</font> Huh?
movie_3012_6=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Erxia:</font> You've wounded me…
movie_3014_1=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Erxia:</font> The Shifu and disciples from this school are all quite sinister. The Shifu killed his Elders, the younger disciple killed the older Disciple, and then the Shifu hunted down the younger disciple.
movie_3014_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Erxia:</font> Ah... I have some words of advice: everything in the world is based on cause and effect and retribution is inescapable. If you go to Green Cloud Castle now you'll probably fall into a trap set up by your disciple.
movie_3014_3=<font color="#ffff00">Elder Hentian:</font> Retribution? Ha ha ha... I've killed more people than I can count in my life. If there is such a thing as divine retribution, I would have died a thousand times already.
movie_3014_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Erxia:</font> Even if retribution doesn't fall upon you yourself, you still have family, loved ones and friends. You will regret it if your sins drag them down.
movie_3014_5=<font color="#ffff00">Elder Hentian:</font> This kid is quite honest and is not afraid to speak his mind. I have many disciples, but none like him.
movie_3014_6=<font color="#ffff00">Elder Hentian:</font> He does make a certain amount of sense. The Old Woman disappeared under mysterious circumstances a few years back. It can be the work of those disciples.
movie_3014_7=<font color="#ffff00">Elder Hentian:</font> If I go to Green Cloud Castle and something unpredicted befalls me, I need to have a backup plan. I won't have those who harmed me get away with it.
movie_3014_8=<font color="#ffff00">Elder Hentian:</font> Kid, I don't need you to teach me…
movie_3014_9=<font color="#ffff00">Elder Hentian:</font> I have a finger technique called "Through Fire and Water". If you can't survive for seven days after I use it on you, you will perish.
movie_3014_10=<font color="#ffff00">Elder Hentian:</font> But if you manage to endure it to the end, the technique will gradually change your constitution and cultivation of the Hentian Technique will be more effective. Once you find Old Woman Hentian, she will pass the Hentian Technique on to you and then you'll be considered a successor of the Hentian line.
movie_3016_1=<font color="#ffff00">Downtrodden Monk:</font> You chi must be full and surging, the spirit should be introverted; there must be no defects, highs or lows, or interruptions.
movie_3016_2=<font color="#ffff00">Downtrodden Monk:</font> No, no, no. You're not executing the move correctly.  Look at me.
movie_3016_3=<font color="#ffff00">Downtrodden Monk:</font> Do not fixate on a particular position. Gain mastery by striking after the enemy has struck, and anticipate the enemy's moves.
movie_3017_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I'm too far away.
movie_3017_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I need to climb onto the roof to hear the conversation.
movie_3017_3=<font color="#ffff00">Han Sijing:</font> It's a good offer. I suggest you take it.
movie_3017_4=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Loukai:</font> Indeed. You must really want him dead to offer me this much money. May I ask why?
movie_3017_5=<font color="#ffff00">Han Sijing:</font> Zhao Ziji is my father's murderer. Now I've finally found him hiding in a small fishing village in Suzhou.
movie_3017_6=<font color="#ffff00">Han Sijing:</font> Ha! Blood begets blood. Not only am I going to kill Zhao Ziji, the whole village has to die!
movie_3017_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Villains! I won't let them kill any more innocent people!
movie_3021_1=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Tao (County Magistrate):</font> This person killed Chang Shanzhao. This is the truth, and we have hard evidence. There is no need for retrial or appeal. Take the prisoner to the execution grounds to be beheaded at noon.
movie_3021_2=<font color="#ffff00">Guard:</font> There's been a mistake, Lord Yang! Someone else killed Master Chang. A colleague saw a person run from Master Chang's home out of the city, and the person had blood on his clothes.
movie_3021_3=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Tao (County Magistrate):</font> What? Well, what are you doing standing here then?! Find the murderer! If you can't catch the suspect, I will hold you responsible!
movie_3021_4=<font color="#ffff00">Guard:</font> The prisoner...
movie_3021_5=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Tao (County Magistrate):</font> Throw the prisoner out! I will not feed another mouth in my jail for no reason!
movie_3021_6=<font color="#ffff00">Guard:</font> Yes, sir.
movie_3022_1=<font color="#ffff00">Royal Guards Disciple:</font> Headmaster, a prisoner slated to be executed has escaped from the jail.
movie_3022_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Do not trouble yourself, Headmaster. I will be right back.
movie_3022_3=<font color="#ffff00">Headmaster:</font> Good.
movie_3022_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> (Oh no, my acupoints have been locked up.)
movie_3022_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> (What... What is this...)
movie_3022_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> (Hey, that's my mouth. Don't mistake it for a centipede hole...)
movie_3022_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Ah... It hurts... I am going to die...
movie_3022_8=<font color="#ffff00">Headmaster:</font> Good, you're finally awake. The Ghost Town Centipede is extremely toxic. You're lucky you're alive.
movie_3022_9=<font color="#ffff00">Headmaster:</font> But... I'm afraid your martial arts have suffered...
movie_3022_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Who knows whether it is a blessing in disguise? If I spare no effort to cultivate my martial arts, I will eventually gain a foothold in Jianghu.
movie_3023_1=<font color="#ffff00">Beggar's Sect Disciple:</font> Headmaster, a thief snuck into the cellar to steal wine.
movie_3024_1=<font color="#ffff00">Scholar Disciple:</font> Headmaster, a thief snuck in to steal paintings and calligraphy.

movie_3028_1=<font color="#ffff00">Wudang Disciple:</font> Headmaster, some younger disciples from the Jian and Qi factions have started quarreling again.

movie_195_1=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> I have been chasing down an old case recently. The murder the case describes caused a sensation back then, but its conclusion was quite strange.
movie_195_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Please continue.
movie_195_3=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> Several years ago, Prefect Magistrate Kuang's concubine was found dead in her bedroom on the day the young master married the second daughter of Suzhou's Yan Family. The concubine was the mother of this second daughter.
movie_195_4=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> The case sent shock waves throughout the entire city of Suzhou. After the murder, Master Yan's first wife and first daughter, Yan Chaoge, were both discovered missing. The authorities tried to find them, but the two women seemed to vanish without a trace.
movie_195_5=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> I was in charge of the case back then, but couldn't close it. In the end, the case was abandoned, and it remains unsolved to this day. I'm been looking into this case once again because I want to find out the truth behind the murder and disappearances once and for all, and fulfill my vow. I have looked over the various statements and records of the time, but I cannot find anymore evidence.
movie_195_6=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> The case has been closed officially and I am unable to investigate the Yan Family in any official capacity now. I was hoping you might help me with this case.
movie_195_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I shall not let you down.
movie_196_1=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> So according to you, the second wife was killed by the first daughter? I cannot simply take the word of one person, let alone without concrete evidence, to decide whether someone is guilty. Do not be so rash. You need to collect more hard evidence.
movie_196_2=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> Go to the Yan Estate again. The family employs many servants. You might want to talk to some of them.
movie_196_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> But I do not know where to start.
movie_196_4=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> Although this case seems complicated, my investigation has pointed me to several people. You need to find the following 4 people:
movie_196_5=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> The Housekeeper, "Xie Yin".
movie_196_6=<font color="#f791ce">Xu Ying:</font> The Servant, "Gao Zhongwang".
movie_196_7=<font color="#f792ce">Xu Ying:</font> The Maid, "Xiang'er".
movie_196_8=<font color="#f792ce">Xu Ying:</font> And the Maid, "Yanhong".
movie_196_9=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> Please proceed with caution.
movie_197_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> The servants at Yan Estate have all either refrained from answering questions or have been uncooperative and secretive. They seem to be hiding something.
movie_197_2=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> You probably won't be able to find out anything this way. The people at Yan Estate will no doubt figure out our intentions by tomorrow. I'm afraid our actions have only served to make them more suspicious of us.
movie_197_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> If people cannot give me the answer I am looking for, then I'll investigate the physical evidence.
movie_197_4=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> You really are perceptive! The murder weapon was never in fact found after the murder. But the Prefect Magistrate ended the case haphazardly, which is why I cannot look into it anymore. So I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you again. I do have a hypothesis, it's just that...
movie_197_5=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> The most guarded place in the Yan Estate is the rear courtyard. You should go look for clues there.
movie_197_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I'll head over to the rear courtyard and see what I can find.
movie_197_7=<font color="#f790ce">Xu Ying:</font> Please be careful.
movie_198_1=<font color="#f790ce">Yanhong:</font> My lady! I have bad news! Recently, someone well versed in martial arts stormed into the Yan Estate in the middle of the night to inquire about the murder of the Second Lady! I'm afraid they are trying to dig up evidence and re-open the case! What should we do?
movie_198_2=<font color="#f790ce">Old Nun:</font> Amitabha! Be calm, Yanhong. We cannot avoid the inevitable. No mortal can escape their fate.
movie_198_3=<font color="#f790ce">Yanhong:</font> But... My lady!
movie_198_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font><font color="#00FFFF">(What a surprise, Yanhong rushed off in the middle of the night to visit the First Lady of the Yan Estate...)</font>
movie_198_5=<font color="#f790ce">Old Nun:</font> The hour grows late. You should return at once. I have this lamp and Buddha with me—you needn't worry about me.
movie_198_6=<font color="#f790ce">Yanhong:</font> Yes, my lady. Yanhong leaves...
movie_198_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I hope you can forgive me for barging in like this in the middle of the night. I am investigating the case in which the second lady of the Yan house was murdered. If you know anything, I beg you to please tell me.
movie_199_1=<font color="#f790ce">After a long while... </font>
movie_199_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I wonder who this is? I should follow them...
movie_200_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Huh? Did I lose them?
movie_200_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Eh!
movie_201_1=<font color="#f790ce">Stranger:</font> You really have some skill!
movie_201_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> If my hunch is correct, you must be Yan Chaoge, first daughter of the Yan family.
movie_201_3=<font color="#f790ce">Yan Chaoge:</font> You have a sharp eye! Indeed, I am Yan Chaoge! It was I who caused the death of the Second Lady. I didn't mean to actually kill that slut. It was just something that happened in the heat of passion. To protect me, mother sent me into hiding. She often comes here secretly to pray in front of Buddha. Not a day goes by that I don't feel regret!
movie_201_4=<font color="#f790ce">Yan Chaoge:</font> I've heard someone wants to reopen this case. I know that I have sinned. But I do not regret killing that slut. I only hate myself for implicating mother. I only came here today to visit mother, and then I will turn myself. My poor mother will have no one to look after her. I shall no longer be able to fulfill my filial duties to mother...
movie_201_5=<font color="#f790ce">Yan Chaoge:</font> Let's go, I will go to the court with you to turn myself in.
movie_201_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Sigh! Although the second wife died from your hands, there is some justification in your actions. And I see that you are sincere in your filial piety to your mother. Enough. Go and be on your way. Pretend you never saw me here, and your secret will be safe with me.
movie_201_7=<font color="#f790ce">Yan Chaoge:</font> Your kindness is beyond words! Please know that you have my deepest gratitude.
movie_202_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Ah! This fragrance is from the plum blossom.
movie_203_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I shall accompany you no further. Take care of yourselves.

movie_4000_1=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Feijue:</font>{@0:} What are you doing here? Are you eavesdropping on my father's conversation?
movie_4001_1=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Xijue:</font> Shen Jun is such a schemer. I thought the two of us researching Slanted Needles was already a deviance from the orthodoxy. I didn't know you had such great and overbearing martial arts skills.
movie_4001_2=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Xijue:</font> Ha ha... ha ha ha... So you learned outside martial arts... Humph! That's a much more serious offense than researching the Slanted Needle. Let's see you explain this to Father.
movie_4001_3=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Jun:</font> I... I...
movie_4001_4=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Feijue:</font> I never thought... I never even considered...
movie_4001_5=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Feijue:</font> How could our obedient and well-behaved role model of a sister, who never disobeyed her parents once, do something so outrageous?
movie_4001_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Quiet! If you want to live then shut your mouth.
movie_4001_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I'll overlook where you led me over to the Master of the House and let me overhear his conversation.
movie_4001_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> But if you want to live, then you have to swear that you won't tell anyone Miss Shen has learned the martial arts of another school, or else I'll be forced to kill you.
movie_4001_9=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Feijue:</font> We swear.
movie_4001_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Both of you have been seriously injured and traditional needles cannot heal such wounds. I've ben told of the Slanted Needle skill known as the "Golden Needle Blood Exchange"
movie_4001_11=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> As I understand it, if it fails it could lead to the death of all three of us.

movie_4001_13=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Be that as it may, your injuries are serious and could lead to death if we don't do something.
movie_4001_14=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> If you die, there will be blood on my hands and I cannot live with that. As I see it, we all have nothing to lose by trying.
movie_4001_15=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Peijue:</font> I have studied this skill you speak of but have never performed it. You are right though. We shall take this gamble.

movie_4002_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Nonsense! Whoever dares to assault someone in front of the Golden Needle Sect has to answer to me.
movie_4002_7=<font color="#ffff00">Local Man:</font> Ha! Then you must be tired of living!
movie_4004_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> What's the Master doing here by himself?
movie_4004_2=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> You shouldn't have come.
movie_4004_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Shanfeng:</font> I will take your life.
movie_4004_4=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> I know you are here for Shen Peijue. He is doing well and living his own life. Why can't you let him be?
movie_4004_5=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Shanfeng:</font> He's my child. It is my right see him.
movie_4004_6=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> What is it you are really after?
movie_4004_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Shanfeng:</font> I am here to kill that slut and that bastard child of hers! Then the three of us can live together, like before.
movie_4004_8=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> Ever since Xiaohuan joined Golden Needle Sect, she has proven to be an able and virtuous person. I will not let you harm her or her child.
movie_4004_9=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Shanfeng:</font> I'm through talking with you. Out of the way!
movie_4004_10=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> Stop!
movie_4004_11=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Shanfeng:</font> Die!
movie_4004_12=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Shanfeng:</font> It's you!?
movie_4004_13=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Peijue:</font> Stay back you crazy old woman! Take this!
movie_4004_14=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Sangu:</font> No!
movie_4004_15=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Shanfeng:</font> Ha ha ha... All my years of suffering...for everything to turn out like this...
movie_4005_1=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> Shanfeng, I'm sorry for what happened in the past.
movie_4005_2=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> But I've had time to think things through. I know Peijue is willing to recognize you as his mother.
movie_4005_3=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> We... We three are family and we can be together once again.  Let leave this place, together. Even if we must travel to the ends of the earth, as long as we're together...
movie_4005_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Shanfeng:</font> Canghai…
movie_4005_5=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> Hahaha! I knew you would be carrying the second half of the Slanted Needle script. With the completed Slanted Needle script, the Golden Needle Sect will dominate Jianghu!
movie_4005_6=<font color="#ffff00">Old Gardener:</font> Humph… Slanted Needle? It's nothing special if you ask me.
movie_4005_7=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> !? Die!
movie_4005_8=<font color="#ffff00">Old Gardener:</font> The Shen Family Golden Needle began as an acupuncture method to cure and serve others. You have chosen to instead use it to harm people and have been deluded into thinking you could dominate Jianghu.
movie_4005_9=<font color="#ffff00">Old Gardener:</font> How many innocent lives have died because of your ambitions? In the end, you are still weak.
movie_4005_10=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> Bastard... Who are you?
movie_4005_11=<font color="#ffff00">Old Gardener:</font> The road to death is long and you should not ask for it. They say Spring never comes to Youming Palace.
movie_4005_12=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> Youming Palace... You're a Youming Palace elder...

movie_4011_1=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> Do you intend to leave?
movie_4011_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Yes.
movie_4011_3=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> Then go...
movie_4011_4=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> But before you go, you must leave behind your martial arts.
movie_4011_5=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> Humph! Throw this person out!
movie_4012_1=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> The Shen Family Golden Needle is an unparalleled technique. Despite the endless disputes in Jianghu, all you need to preserve yourself is this skill.
movie_4012_2=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> What's more, everyone in Jianghu are combative so injuries are inevitable. As doctors, everyone wants to curry favor with us, ha ha.
movie_4012_3=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Canghai:</font> You have mastered our techniques. Remember to make good use of your skills so people in Jianghu will not underestimate Golden Needle Sect.
movie_4012_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Yes!
movie_4012_5=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Sangu:</font> Ha ha! Don't mind Older Brother, he loses his temper easily. Be careful in your travels and remember, if you can't stand it anymore, you can always come back here.
movie_4012_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Hmm.
movie_4012_7=<font color="#ffff00">Wang Tianhuai: </font>{@IDName:Player}, take care.
movie_4012_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> You too.
movie_4012_9=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Sangu:</font> Go!
movie_4012_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> My good Masters, the lush mountains stay still while green waters flow. Until we meet again!
movie_4012_11=<font color="#ffff00">Everyone:</font> Until we meet again!
movie_4050_1=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Wuji:</font> I do not know when the Rootless Clan came into existence. We have seen dynasties come and go, and Rootless Clan has always survived them. Our ways have been continuously passed down from generation to generation.
movie_4050_2=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Wuji:</font> Zhao Gao of the Qin dynasty; Sima Qian of Western Han; Cai Lun of Eastern Han; Gao Lishi of the Tang dynasty; Tong Guan of the Song dynasty. These were all influential men throughout the ages and they were also all members of Rootless Clan.
movie_4050_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Wuji:</font> Some of our disciples come from inside the palace, and some of them are like you, coming from Jianghu. Though we are attached to imperial power, the force inside the Imperial Court is just one of our pawns.
movie_4050_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Wuji:</font> Even if we are despised and rejected by the world, we must live and win dignity for ourselves.
movie_4050_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Wuji:</font> The founder of our faction mocked himself for having "lost his root," if you catch my drift, which is why he named the faction the Rootless Clan. We, the younger generation, need to encourage each other and gain self-esteem, and work hard so no one will dare underestimate us.
movie_4050_6=<font color="#ffff00">Zhao Wuji:</font> Well, I've said all I need to say. Now you must prove yourself in the Sinister Hall.
movie_4051_1=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Changhen:</font> Over here! Be careful and stay hidden.
movie_4051_2=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Changhen:</font> This batch of imperial steel is the goal of our current mission. Because it involves the Imperial Court, we can't be involved directly.
movie_4051_3=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Changhen:</font> But people in Jianghu are willing to do anything for money. What we need to do is to borrow a knife to kill.
movie_4051_4=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Changhen:</font> They've struck a deal with us in advance. Go to the agreed upon location and make your reconnaissance. These aren't good people, so be careful. I'll be right behind you.
movie_4051_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Yes!
movie_4052_1=<font color="#ffff00">Lei Ming:</font> Feng Changhen told you to come, right? Hmph! If you want the imperial steel, you'll have to prove yourself first!
movie_4052_2=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Changhen:</font> Ha ha ha... long time no see, Master Lei!
movie_4052_3=<font color="#ffff00">Lei Ming:</font> Hehe, Brother Feng, according to the rules of Jianghu, you are entitled to a share of imperial steel as well.
movie_4052_4=<font color="#ffff00">Lei Ming:</font> But my disciples have suffered heavy casualties, and they risked their lives to get the cargo, so I'm not willing to let anyone just reap the profits.
movie_4052_5=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Changhen:</font> You want to pocket all of it?  Think carefully, Master Lei!
movie_4052_6=<font color="#ffff00">Lei Ming:</font> Enough talk! My Disciples, kill them! Then the imperial steel will belong to us!
movie_4052_7=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Changhen:</font> Rootless Clan disciples, kill them all!
movie_4052_8=<font color="#ffff00">Lei Ming:</font> But…fine. Nut I will get you for this, even if I die!
movie_4053_1=<font color="#ffff00">Yan Lingyun:</font> I'm ready, when do we start?
movie_4053_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Let's start now.
movie_4053_3=<font color="#ffff00">Constable:</font> Who's there? How dare you break into jail?
movie_4053_4=<font color="#ffff00">Yan Lingyun:</font> He's dead!
movie_4053_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Oh no, someone's been here! There's been a change in the plan, we shouldn't stay here, let's go!
movie_4053_6=<font color="#ffff00">Constable:</font> Somebody help, someone's raiding the jail!
movie_4054_1=<font color="#ffff00">Wei Wuyan:</font> Our school's way of the sword does not rely on force nor technical Skill, only speed.
movie_4054_2=<font color="#ffff00">Wei Wuyan:</font> The sword is born from ecstasy, the fatal sword forms itself. The gods and Buddha are compassionate, ferrying me into the demon realm.
movie_4055_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Brother Yan? Why are you here?
movie_4055_2=<font color="#ffff00">Yan Lingyun:</font> Father...
movie_4055_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Father?
movie_4055_4=<font color="#ffff00">Yan Lingyun:</font> Well, {@IDName:Player}, I treated you as a brother and this is how you thank me! You ungrateful bastard! I must kill you to soothe the hatred in my heart!
movie_4055_5=<font color="#ffff00">Yan Lingyun:</font> Die!
movie_4055_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Wait, Brother Yan, I...
movie_4055_7=<font color="#ffff00">Yan Lingyun:</font> You're no longer my brother! Die!
movie_4055_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Brother Yan! Listen to me!
movie_4055_9=<font color="#ffff00">Yan Lingyun:</font> I will not listen to a deceiver such as you!
movie_4055_10=<font color="#ffff00">Yan Lingyun:</font>{@IDName:Player} Remember this, though I wasn't able to kill you today, there will come a day when I will kill you with my own bare hands!
movie_4056_1=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaochi:</font> How do you think I should handle this, Vice-Chancellor?
movie_4056_2=<font color="#ffff00">Ministry of Punishments Vice-Chancellor:</font> This... I...
movie_4056_3=<font color="#ffff00">Secretary:</font> Please calm yourself, Your Highness!
movie_4056_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaochi:</font> There was an East Chamber insignia at the scene of the murder, this is concrete evidence! Isn't it enough?
movie_4056_5=<font color="#ffff00">Secretary:</font> Although an East Chamber insignia was found at the scene of the crime, a few days ago an East Chamber man died in a gambling house and his insignia went missing.
movie_4056_6=<font color="#ffff00">Secretary:</font> I'm afraid this case isn't as simple as you think!
movie_4056_7=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaochi:</font> Hmph! A fire occurs and even people are reduced to ashes in the wind. How could a damn insignia still remain?!
movie_4056_8=<font color="#ffff00">Secretary:</font> I beg your highness to reconsider.
movie_4056_9=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaochi:</font> Don't give me this tripe! I know you have a good relationship with the East Chamber. If you don't do it, I'll do it myself!
movie_4056_10=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaochi:</font> What happened today is between you, me and him. If any of this gets out... Hmph!
movie_4056_11=<font color="#ffff00">Secretary:</font> Your Highness...
movie_4056_12=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaochi:</font> My mind is made up! I will make the East Chamber regret the consequences of siding with the wrong person!
movie_4057_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> The hour is here yet the insider still hasn't shown up.
movie_4057_2=<font color="#ffff00">??? </font>: Stop!
movie_4057_3=<font color="#ffff00">Imperial Troop Leader:</font> It's just a eunuch. Go and bury him somewhere.
movie_4057_4=<font color="#ffff00">Imperial Troop:</font> Yes, Sir!
movie_4057_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Oh no, the insider has been killed. I need to consult Feng Changhen.
movie_4058_1=<font color="#ffff00">??? :</font> Oh no!
movie_4058_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Let's see where you run off to!
movie_4059_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName: Player}: </font>What's going on?
movie_4060_1=<font color="#ffff00">Master Lu (Brothel Customer):</font> Come here my sweetie and let me have a feel...
movie_4060_2=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Rui (Courtesan):</font> Slow down, My Lord...
movie_4060_3=<font color="#ffff00">Master Lu (Brothel Customer):</font> Oh, who is it?
movie_4060_4=<font color="#ffff00">Clerk:</font> Someone has informed us that they saw imperial steel here, search the place!
movie_4060_5=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Rui (Courtesan):</font> Oh my, whatever it is it has nothing to do with me, Sir...
movie_4060_6=<font color="#ffff00">Clerk:</font> The imperial steel is here!
movie_4060_7=<font color="#ffff00">Clerk:</font> You two! Stealing and hiding imperial steel is a grave offense, you need to come with us!
movie_4060_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> This woman... Humph... It wouldn't be a clean enough job unless I killed all of the witnesses too, would it?
movie_4062_1=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaoxu:</font> What happened? Why are you so disheveled! Have you no sense of decency!
movie_4062_2=<font color="#ffff00">Jin Duancheng (Corrupt Official):</font> Your... Your Highness! An assassin was tracking someone who claimed to be from Black Wind Stronghold. The same assassin tried to kill me.
movie_4062_3=<font color="#ffff00">Jin Duancheng:</font> According to the person from Black Wind Stronghold, the Royal Guards and Black Wind Stronghold tried to steel the imperial steel. Afterwards, the Royal Guards wanted the imperial steel for themselves and annihilated Black Wind Stronghold.
movie_4062_4=<font color="#ffff00">Jin Duancheng:</font> This person tracked the imperial steel to the Royal Guards' vault and was discovered, and then they were hunted.
movie_4062_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaoxu:</font> Oh? Ha ha! Good. I thought there was something strange about the imperial steel! Now I finally have new evidence.
movie_4062_6=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaoxu:</font> Hmph! Don't think I don't know that the Royal Guards have secretly aligned themselves with Zhu Gaochi! I'll have my revenge for all these years! I will report this to my father and raid the Royal Guards!
movie_4062_7=<font color="#ffff00">Jin Duancheng:</font> Your Highness, that can be...inappropriate! Things will become hard to manage if they are blown out of proportion. And we cannot convince everyone with words alone!
movie_4062_8=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaoxu:</font> Rest assured, I have made my own arrangements! Didn't this person say the Royal Guards stored the imperial steel in their vault? Hmph!
movie_4062_9=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaoxu:</font> This cannot be divulged! Dispose of the body of that woman there! Do you understand?
movie_4062_10=<font color="#ffff00">Jin Duancheng:</font> I understand, Your Highness.
movie_4062_11=<font color="#ffff00">Jin Duancheng:</font> Toss this body into the river.
movie_4064_1=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Changhen:</font> Let the main force deal with the Royal Guards and take down the generals in the back.
movie_4064_2=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Changhen:</font> Go!
movie_4065_1=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaosui:</font> Your majesty, I have something important to report.
movie_4065_2=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Di:</font> What is it?
movie_4065_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaosui:</font> The Royal Guards have dared to act against an imperial edict by killing a high-ranking general! Their intention to betray your majesty is as clear as day! Their disobedience has shocked the world!
movie_4065_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaosui:</font> If I may borrow three thousand brave men from your majesty, I shall wipe out these treacherous Royal Guards to rid the world of this threat.
movie_4065_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Di:</font> With a son like this, I have no need to envy Zhongmou! You have our permission!
movie_4069_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Where are they?
movie_4069_2=<font color="#ffff00">Man in Black:</font> All Rootless Clan traitors must be hunted down and punished!
movie_4069_3=<font color="#ffff00">Kou Hai:</font> No one may take what belongs to Rootless Clan!
movie_4069_4=<font color="#ffff00">Feng Changhen:</font> Though your Rootless Clan martial arts have been taken away, your life has been spared. Be careful of what you do from now on.
movie_4070_1=<font color="#ffff00">Wei Wuyan:</font> Although the Rootless Clan isn't as powerful as it once was, it still isn't somewhere you can just join and leave on a whim.
movie_4070_2=<font color="#ffff00">Wei Wuyan:</font> I see that still waters really do run deep! Since you haven't lost to Kou Hai... No matter. You may leave.
movie_4070_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Thank you, Lord Wei.
movie_4070_4=<font color="#ffff00">Wei Wuyan:</font> But you must remember not to reveal any of Rootless Clan's secrets while you are in Jianghu, or I will cut you down with my sword, even if I have to hunt you down to the ends of the earth!
movie_4071_1=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaosui:</font> Master Zhuge, can we trust that person? What do you think?
movie_4071_2=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Jiang:</font> Your Highness has been concealing your abilities and biding your times so you were able to avoid a fate like Zhu Gaoxu's.
movie_4071_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaosui:</font> Do you think I should keep on concealing my abilities?
movie_4071_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Jiang:</font> No! The Royal Guards have exposed their strength because of this incident and have become the Emperor's greatest curse.
movie_4071_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Jiang:</font> Your Highness should have an audience with the Emperor and offer to lead the troops to take down the Royal Guards. Even if the Emperor refuses your request, he'll understand what you're trying to do.
movie_4071_6=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Jiang:</font> If He grants your request, it'll be a chance for Your Highness to render meritorious service to Him. Even if Your Highness is unsuccessful in wiping out the Royal Guards, you still deserve to be recognized for your hard work.
movie_4071_7=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Jiang:</font> This way, Your Highness cannot possibly lose! So why not do it?
movie_4071_8=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaosui:</font> Such brilliant insight! I will go ask for an audience with the Emperor right now!
movie_4100_1=<font color="#ffff00">Xiaocheng:</font> Ah!!
movie_4100_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Oh no!
movie_4101_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Ah!
movie_4101_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I have failed. Please punish me as you see fit, Villa Leader!
movie_4101_3=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Shuying:</font> You...
movie_4101_4=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Shuying:</font> Huh?!
movie_4101_5=<font color="#ffff00">Villager:</font> Kill it!
movie_4101_6=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Shuying:</font> Don't just stand there! Go drive those people away!
movie_4101_7=<font color="#ffff00">Disciples:</font> This hawk is ours! Go away! Go away!
movie_4101_8=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Shuying:</font> This...
movie_4101_9=<font color="#ffff00">Woman:</font> My child, why are you running!
movie_4101_10=<font color="#ffff00">Xiaocheng:</font> No, it's...
movie_4101_11=<font color="#ffff00">Xiaocheng:</font> It's that person! If it wasn't for them, that hawk wouldn't have attacked me!
movie_4101_12=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I...
movie_4101_15=<font color="#f790ce">Villagers:</font> Get out of here! Beat it!
movie_4101_16=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> You...
movie_4101_17=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Shuying:</font> Let's go...
movie_4101_18=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Yes…
movie_4102_1=<font color="#ffff00">Villagers:</font> Scatter! Run!
movie_4103_1=<font color="#ffff00">Villager:</font> Bring "that thing" out here!
movie_4103_2=<font color="#ffff00">Villager:</font> Go!
movie_4104_1=<font color="#ffff00">Crazy Woman:</font> I was foolish, foolish I tells ya!
movie_4104_2=<font color="#ffff00">Crazy Woman:</font> I only thought wild beasts would come into the village when there was snow in the mountains and they were left with nothing to eat.
movie_4104_3=<font color="#ffff00">Crazy Woman:</font> I didn't know they would come in the Spring as well…
movie_4104_4=<font color="#ffff00">Crazy Woman:</font> That morning...I gave my son Amao a basket full of beans and asked him to peel them on the threshold…
movie_4104_5=<font color="#ffff00">Crazy Woman:</font> He was a very obedient child…following to my every word…
movie_4104_6=<font color="#ffff00">Crazy Woman:</font> When it came time to steam the beans, I called out to Amao…but there was no answer. I went outside and I saw the beans strewn all over the place...and Amao was missing!!!
movie_4104_7=<font color="#ffff00">Crazy Woman:</font> I asked and asked everyone where he was... but we were only able to find one of his shoes. They said it must have been leopards!
movie_4104_8=<font color="#ffff00">Crazy Woman:</font> And I haven't seen my Amao since…
movie_4104_9=<font color="#ffff00">Crazy Woman:</font> A fool I was. A fool I am!

movie_4108_5=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Mengxiong:</font> This wine tastes kind of funny today.
movie_4108_6=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Yushi:</font> Oh no! The wine is poisoned!
movie_4108_7=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Shuying:</font> Benefactor, don't drink it!
movie_4108_8=<font color="#ffff00">Su Zhanye: </font>I do not drink, because I set up the poison!

movie_4108_10=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Shuying:</font> My benefactor, what are you doing?
movie_4108_12=<font color="#ffff00">Su Zhanye: </font>I need you to do the healing for me, so I exchanged my clothes with his and changed my appearance, and it did deceive you.
movie_4108_13=<font color="#ffff00">Su Zhanye: </font>I left behind the recipe of a medicine and pretended to be dead in order to cultivate. You took the bait and helped me recover.
movie_4108_16=<font color="#ffff00">Su Zhanye: </font>Die!
movie_4110_1=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Shuying:</font> You insist on leaving?
movie_4110_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Yes.
movie_4110_3=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Shuying:</font> You can leave.
movie_4110_4=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Shuying:</font> But before you go, you must leave your martial arts behind.
movie_4110_5=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Shuying:</font> Humph! Throw this person out!
movie_4111_2=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Shuying:</font> We often come into contact with birds and beasts. Although we also pay attention to wisdom and courage, the cunning of animals cannot compare to the evils and dangers that lurk in Jianghu.
movie_4111_3=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Shuying:</font> You have completed all of your training. But remember what I said, and be careful when you are in Jianghu.
movie_4111_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I promise to heed the Villa Leader's teachings!

movie_4200_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> This appears to be the legendary Peach Blossom Array!
movie_4200_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Let me try and see how good this array is!
movie_4200_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> What is this? It says "birth", "hide", "rest", "fear", "admire", "harm", "open" and "death"...
movie_4200_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> This array seems to coincide with the rationale behind the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams! And here I was, trying to force my way in like a brute...
movie_4200_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Oh no! Ah...
movie_4200_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Who are you? Help... Help me...!
movie_4202_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>I,<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>, pay my respects to Lord Huang!
movie_4202_4=<font color="#ffff00">Huang Guxiao:</font> Well, you have passed many difficult trials in order to reach us, which says much about your perseverance. I shall admit you into the Island. You must continue to cultivate yourself, and never cease practicing.
movie_4203_1=<font color="#f790ce">Duan Haiqing:</font> In front of you is the famous Peach Blossom Array.
movie_4203_3=<font color="#f790ce">Duan Haiqing:</font> Peach Blossom Array is only dangerous to those who do not know the intricacies of arrays. Lord Huang's daughter, Huang Lingshu, often plays around inside the array.
movie_4203_4=<font color="#ffff00">Duan Haiqing:</font> Eh? Huang... Huang Lingshu!
movie_4203_5=<font color="#ffff00">Huang Lingshu:</font> Duan Haiqing, you traitor! You even brought a little lackey with you! Hold it right there!
movie_4203_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Duan Haiqing, stop!
movie_4204_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Ask the universe, and receive an eternal answer. Given enough time, even the deepest seas are turned to fields.
movie_4204_2=<font color="#f790ce">Old Fisherman:</font> Lament life's fame and fortune; one succeeds in the morning and is defeated at evening, everything is up to the heavens.
movie_4204_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> As flowers bloom and leaves fall, I know not the world, nor can recall spring or autumn.
movie_4204_4=<font color="#f790ce">Old Fisherman:</font> Ups and downs, victories and defeat; light and shadow, rise and fall; time passes and circumstances change; flower petals fall onto the water and flow east.
movie_4204_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> When we met this morning, we talked about the sun's shadow moving; but if we meet tomorrow, how can we know for sure whether the sun will show itself?
movie_4204_6=<font color="#f790ce">Old Fisherman:</font> The mountains are pale and crisp; the water flows in a boundless course.

movie_4205_3=<font color="#f790ce">Jia Dacai:</font> It must have been you who bumped into me! Quit fooling around. Thinking of trying something, are you? Well, you better just forget it.
movie_4205_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Zhang Sanying has succeeded. Let's leave before Jia Dacai finds out.
movie_4206_1=<font color="#ffff00">Huang Lingshu:</font> Let me take you outside of Peach Blossom Array!
movie_4206_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Thank you, Miss!
movie_4207_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Elder brother, please advise me!

movie_4250_1=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Mofeng:</font> Ha ha ha! First have wine! I'll toast you.
movie_4250_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> (Hic)... (Hic)... Now this is some good wine!
movie_4250_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Mofeng:</font> I remember when I traveled throughout Jianghu with Yunzheng, punishing evil wherever we found it. We were quite an impressive sight, if I do say so myself.
movie_4250_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Mofeng:</font> Especially Yunzheng! He was grumpy and had a horrific temper. Indeed, he was not a man to be trifled with. He went wherever there was injustice.
movie_4250_5=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Mofeng:</font> Back then, everyone referred to us as the Xu Masters. We made a lot of enemies for using this title.
movie_4250_6=<font color="#ffff00"></font>
movie_4250_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Mofeng:</font> One time… (Rambles on)
movie_4250_8=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Mofeng:</font> …in the end, we established Xu Family Manor, which was quite well-known throughout Jianghu.
movie_4250_9=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Mofeng:</font> I apologize. I haven't talked to others in a long time. I've taken up a lot of your time. Go ahead and speak to Yunzheng about joining Xu Family Manor!
movie_4250_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Thank you good sir. Until we meet again! And thank you for the wine. (That wine tasted horrible! I'll remember not to come here ever again.)
movie_4251_1=Now that's interesting…
movie_4251_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Zixi:</font> You always execute this move incorrectly, Haoyue.
movie_4251_3=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Haoyue:</font> It is because don't know how to properly link these moves together.
movie_4251_4=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Haoyue:</font> When I execute these moves, they are always rigid. Even though I don't have a weapon in my hand, I need to move accordingly…
movie_4251_5=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Haoyue:</font> Hah!
movie_4251_6=<font color="#ffff00">Shen Haoyue:</font> Like this, Zixi?
movie_4251_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Zixi:</font> Yes, continue linking it like that. Then you won't expose your weakness like before.
movie_4252_1=<font color="#ffff00">Cao Teng:</font> Xu Yunzheng, show yourself!
movie_4252_2=<font color="#ffff00">Cao Teng:</font> The Xu Family Manor raided an Four Seas Escort Agency escort and killed my brothers. Hand over the murderer or I will find him myself!
movie_4252_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Tianchi:</font> How dare you come here and speak such, old man!
movie_4252_4=<font color="#ffff00">Cao Teng:</font> Hmph!
movie_4252_5=<font color="#ffff00">Cao Teng:</font> Tah!
movie_4252_6=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> Stop!
movie_4252_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> Step back, Tianchi.
movie_4252_8=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Tianchi:</font> ...Yes my Lord.
movie_4252_9=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> You claim that someone from Xu Family Manor raided an escort and murdered your brothers. Do you have evidence? If someone from Xu Family Manor did commit these crimes, I will be the first one to punish them.
movie_4252_10=<font color="#ffff00">Cao Teng:</font> The cuts on the bodies perfectly match the blade of your new heavy sword! That is more than enough evidence!
movie_4252_11=<font color="#ffff00">Cao Teng:</font> Admit it what you have done, Xu Yunzheng.
movie_4252_12=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> The murders were not committed by Xu Family Manor. This is an attempt to frame us.
movie_4252_13=<font color="#ffff00">Cao Teng:</font> What a lousy excuse!
movie_4252_14=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> Ugn...
movie_4254_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> That figure seems familiar...
movie_4254_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> That looks like Zhou Yunpeng. What is he doing here?
movie_4254_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Let me follow him and see.
movie_4254_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Tianchi:</font> Uh...
movie_4254_5=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Tianchi:</font> Is the Nangong Family trying to kill me?
movie_4254_6=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yunpeng:</font> You still don't know who's trying to kill you, Xu Tianchi, even though you're on the brink of death?
movie_4254_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Tianchi:</font> I thought you were injured, Zhou Yunpeng. Why are you here?
movie_4254_8=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yunpeng:</font> Everything was as the Patriarch expected. Now if only Xu Tianchi dies...
movie_4254_9=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yunpeng:</font> Oh...
movie_4254_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Third Villa Leader, are you alright?
movie_4255_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Zhou Yunpeng, why are you trying to harm our Third Villa Leader?
movie_4255_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Could it be that it was the Four Seas Escort Agency that tried to frame Xu Family Manor?
movie_4255_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yunpeng:</font> Four Seas Escort Agency? Hum...
movie_4255_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yunpeng:</font> The Four Seas Escort Agency can't manage something this big.
movie_4255_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> If it wasn't the Four Seas Escort Agency, being one person, it couldn't have been you.
movie_4255_6=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yunpeng:</font> Four Seas Escort Agency doesn't even deserve to pick up shoes for the Silent Temple. Everything is in the Patriarch's hands, none of you can run.
movie_4255_7=<font color="#ffff00">Cao Teng:</font> Zhou Yunpeng, I raised you and taught you all the martial arts I knew. How can you be so ungrateful!
movie_4255_8=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yunpeng:</font> Old man, your crummy martial arts cannot begin to compare with those of the Patriarch's.
movie_4255_9=<font color="#ffff00">Fu Boyuan:</font> Zhou Yunpeng, the Silent Temple's conspiracy directing you to provoke unrest between southwest Wulin factions has been brought to light. Tell us about the Silent Temple and we will let you live.
movie_4255_10=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yunpeng:</font> Humph! Since I've failed the Patriarch won't let me live anyways. I don't need your mercy.
movie_4263_1=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Ziling:</font>Attack. I'll fell you three moves.
movie_4263_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Zishuo:</font> You underestimate me.
movie_4263_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Ziling:</font> Ah, thanks for scratching that itch! Allow me to return the favor!
movie_4263_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Zishuo:</font> Ugn...
movie_4263_5=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Ziling:</font> Ha ha! That was fun. Even if you were to train for one hundred years, you still would not be able to beat me!
movie_4263_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I must say, an impressive display. I'd like to introduce myself. I am a new disciple.
movie_4263_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Ziling:</font> Welcome. Say, how about you let my younger brother test your skills.
movie_4263_8=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Zishuo:</font> I lost...
movie_4263_9=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I…ok. Please do not be too ruthless, Young Master.
movie_4264_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Swim free, little fish.
movie_4264_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Mofeng:</font> Hmm. Good, you've got potential.
movie_4272_1=<font color="#ffff00">Lin Feng:</font> Those idiots at Weiyuan Escort Agency lost the imperial grain! How are you going to explain this, pray tell? Today will be your ruin! I will have my revenge, with interest——anyone who dares try to stop me is a dead man!
movie_4273_1=<font color="#ffff00">Feng You:</font> You bunch of useless idiots! How could you mess up such a simple assignment? If I want something done right, must I always do it myself? Is that it? Well, I might as well start by taking your lives! Ha ha ha ha!
movie_4258_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Sir.
movie_4258_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> Congratulations on your success.
movie_4258_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> You flatter me, Sir.
movie_4258_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> Ha ha! Good. Get up. I need to tell you something: Now that you've joined the Xu Family Manor, you must abide by our rules.
movie_4258_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I admit I do not know them completely.
movie_4258_6=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> I will have someone teach them to you.
movie_4258_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> Have the Third Villa Leader come here.
movie_4258_8=<font color="#ffff00">Servant:</font> Yes, Lord.
movie_4258_9=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Tianchi:</font> I'm here. What do you need?
movie_4258_10=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> Let me introduce you to a new disciple, <font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>. I am putting you in charge of teaching him.
movie_4258_11=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Tianchi:</font> Leave it to me.
movie_4258_12=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Tianchi:</font> If there's nothing else, I'll be going.
movie_4258_13=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> That will be all. You may go about your business.
movie_4258_14=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> Alright... Being that you are a new disciple, I expect you to work extra hard.
movie_4258_15=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I will live up to the Xu Family's expectations.
movie_4259_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Villa Leader, these are the two treasures I managed to collect: "Beauty Yu" and "Snow Scene". Let us enjoy them together!
movie_4259_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> You have visited frequently, giving my calligraphy and paintings. When I am not here, the servants have accepted them on my behalf. I do not know what you want. How about you come straight out and say it!
movie_4259_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I have heard that Master Xu is an upright and chivalrous man who traveled the lands in his youth, during which time he punished evil and established his reputation in Jianghu. After you returned, you developed an interest in calligraphy and painting, and often travel. I have admired Master Xu for a long time and wish to join Xu Family Manor.
movie_4259_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> You have a good look about you, and I can tell that you are a talented person. You remind me a lot of me when I was young. But visiting and wishing to join my faction so suddenly... This is all so sudden. If I were to let you into Xu Family Manor so easily, it would lack impartiality!
movie_4259_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Does Villa Leader wish to test my sincerity?
movie_4259_6=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng:</font> How about I ask you some questions. If you answer correctly, I will consider letting you join Xu Family Manor!
movie_4260_1=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Xiaoqing (Crazy Beggar):</font> I've begged for a few days and I've finally encountered a kind-hearted person. If it wasn't for that incident back then, I would be dressed like the Young Hero, wandering the world as well.
movie_4260_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> (This beggar is walking around in a daze; he must not have eaten for several days. His lips are slightly quivering and a deep sadness can be seen in his blurred eyes. A sense of old pride remains on his handsome face.)
movie_4260_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Xiaoqing (Crazy Beggar):</font> (Pointing to the buns) This... Young Hero is the reincarnation of Buddha! I've begged for food around here for several days but only this Young Hero here has shown me mercy.
movie_4260_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> It's only a few buns. Nothing worth mentioning. You should finish them while they're still hot.
movie_4260_5=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Xiaoqing (Crazy Beggar):</font> (Crazy Beggar eats the buns and begin to cry) This taste reminds me of my mother's dishes! Too bad I will never get to eat them again.
movie_4260_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> You have delicate features and don't seem like someone who has begged for a long time. What in the world caused you to become like this? If you don't mind, please tell me!
movie_5407_1=<font color="#ffff00">Old Man of Peach Blossom:</font> All of this goes back to Qiu Butong and Xiaoyue...
movie_5407_2=<font color="#ffff00">Old Man of Peach Blossom:</font> Back then...
movie_5407_3=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Butong:</font> Who are you?

movie_5407_7=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Butong:</font> What, how did I lose? No way, one more time!
movie_5407_8=<font color="#ffff00">??? : </font>These disputes are of little consequence.

movie_5407_10=<font color="#ffff00">??? : </font>Ah, there are much more important things than reputation in the world.
movie_5407_11=<font color="#ffff00">Qiu Butong:</font> I don't care! You can have whatever you want! As long as you fight me.
movie_5407_12=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Yue</font>dear
movie_5407_13=<font color="#ffff00">??? : </font>Then you don't regret.
movie_5407_14=<font color="#ffff00">??? : </font>I poisoned her by a rare poison. If you can antidote it, you are the Poison Envoy.
movie_5407_15=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Yue</font>dear

movie_5407_20=<font color="#ffff00">Old Man of Peach Blossom:</font> Winning and losing in the end must end; a cry, a laugh, the wind blows the delicate white petals into a cloud of snow.
movie_5407_21=<font color="#ffff00">Old Man of Peach Blossom:</font> Needle cup, jade buckle and all-consuming love; life and death, no one knows what the two worlds hold.
movie_5408_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Thank you for saving me!
movie_5408_2=<font color="#ffff00">Chen Xuanzang:</font> No need to thank me. I was just passing through and simply lent a hand.
movie_5408_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> You tamed the wild beast with only one song. What a miracle!
movie_5408_4=<font color="#ffff00">Chen Xuanzang:</font> Ha ha! Would you like to learn the skill?

movie_5415_4=<font color="#ffff00">County Magistrate:</font> He saved the lives of everyone in Suzhou City and protected their property!
movie_5415_5=<font color="#ffff00">County Magistrate:</font> Prefect Magistrate was wounded in several places and his family also suffered casualties. Master Kuang placed the lives of the Suzhou people first, and should be hailed as a model for all government officials to follow!

movie_5501_1=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist Mu:</font> I was not waiting for you. You shouldn't have come.
movie_5501_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xie Junke:</font> Whether I should have come or not was neither for you nor I to decide. I am fated to come here, unless you take away my life.
movie_5501_3=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist Mu:</font> Young men treat their lives so carelessly. This mountain of bodies and sea of blood is the remnant of this generation of Jianghu heroes; and the result? Can you tell any of these limbs and body parts apart?
movie_5501_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xie Junke:</font> They've given their lives for chivalrous and justice, which is a lot better than you, living without any morals.

movie_5502_1=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist Mu:</font> Like I said, she is not only beautiful, but also deadly.

movie_5502_6=<font color="#ffff00">Xie Junke:</font> Not human?
movie_5502_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xie Junke:</font> Maybe I'm not. I don't know if a person should be called alive or dead if his body is still living but his heart has died...
movie_5503_1=<font color="#ffff00">Luoyang Prefect Magistrate:</font> A powerful enemy is coming, and I would like fellow martial arts experts to lend a hand.

movie_5507_2=<font color="#ffff00">Henchman for Taoist Mu:</font> Humph! Those were just a couple of worthless lives. My master is invincible and is challenging everyone in the world right here! All outsiders shall be killed!
movie_5507_3=<font color="#ffff00">Swordsman:</font> A mere Taoist Mu dare to be presumptuous here. We'll punish you on behalf of the heavens and annihilate you!

movie_5510_1=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist Mu:</font> Is that all you have?
movie_5511_2=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist Mu:</font> Shadow Guard, go retrieve it!
movie_5512_1=<font color="#ffff00">Taoist Mu:</font> Impossible!

movie_5513_1=<font color="#ffff00">Servant: </font>Master, Xie Junke will engage in a death match with Wo Weihuang on the 15th of the eighth month, at Moon Tower. Xie Junke is currently on Moon Tower with his sword!
movie_5513_2=<font color="#ffff00">Ximen the Invincible: </font>Ok! Have the hero invitations been distributed?
movie_5513_3=<font color="#ffff00">Servant: </font>The people of Jianghu have heard that by killing Xie Junke, they may be able to obtain Master's weapon production techniques, and have come to Luoyang City! It's only that Lord Qin's orders were to...
movie_5513_4=<font color="#ffff00">Ximen the Invincible: </font>You do not need to worry about this! All you need to do is your current job.
movie_5513_5=<font color="#ffff00">Servant: </font>Yes, sir.
movie_5513_6=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>I hear the Ximen the Invincible has widely distributed hero invitations and is trying to exchange his weapon producing techniques for my head. Should we postpone our fight?
movie_5513_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xie Junke: </font>There is no need to fear that clown!

movie_5514_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Hey, there is no need to do that to him, he does not know martial arts and is only Ximen the Invincible's butler.
movie_5514_6=<font color="#ffff00">Yan Wangshi: </font>Whoever gets Hell's Judgment must live with the consequences, this is your own fault.
movie_5514_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Who are you, really? Why are you widely spreading the Hell's Judgment?
movie_5514_8=<font color="#ffff00">Yan Wangshi: </font>There is no rush, he will have his soon enough.
movie_5514_9=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>(It is said that each Hell's Judgment records a secret of the person who accepts it, and that those people are then controlled by the Lord of Hell. Let me see what Ximen the Invincible's secret is.)
movie_5514_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>(Ah! Ximen the Invincible's real name is Tao Qiansui, and is the older brother of Tao Baisui. In the past, in order to gain power over their family possessions, he had an affair with his brother's concubine and gave away his brother's whereabouts to Blade Sharpening Hall.)
movie_5514_11=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>(Since the Hell's Judgment was for Ximen the Invincible, and Ximen the Invincible is already dead, why did Yan Wangshi have the butler accept the Hell's Judgment?)

movie_5559_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Eh... He's good.
movie_5559_7=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Loukai:</font> Ha ha... My "bedroom kung fu" is even harder and faster!

movie_5559_10=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Loukai:</font> Ah well, I have other things to do, anyway. The victory is yours today. I'll be back next time!
movie_4153_1=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader:</font> Ha ha! You are industrious and like to eat vegetables. I like you.
movie_4153_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Thank you, my lady.
movie_4153_3=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader:</font> The Palace of Shifting Flowers needs people like you. Come with me!
movie_4153_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Of course.
movie_4155_1=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Disciple:</font>Greetings, my lady.
movie_4155_2=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Disciple:</font>The task is done. The woman has been saved.
movie_4155_3=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader:</font> Excellent. You did well!
movie_4155_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> It was only what anyone should have done. I did have some help, however.
movie_4155_5=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader:</font> It was I, throwing a rock!
movie_4155_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I see, so you followed me to Chengdu.
movie_4155_7=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader:</font> I wanted to test your martial arts, but I didn't think that bully would be so strong! He is no match for us, though.
movie_4155_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I am impressed with the skills of the palace.
movie_4155_9=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader:</font> So, do you want to stay in the Palace to learn our martial arts?
movie_4155_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I do.
move_4150_1=<font color="#ffff00">Guard: </font>Who goes there?
move_4150_3=<font color="#ffff00">Guard:</font> Hah! A worthless little girl like you could never hope to join our illustrious ranks! Let's fight!
move_4150_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Wait! I have a token!
move_4150_5=<font color="#ffff00">Guard:</font> Since you passed the test, you may go in to see the Palace Leader.
move_4151_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>: I've taken care of the flower nursery as you instructed, my lady!
move_4151_2=<font color="#ffff00">Gardener:</font> Good, you've done well.
move_4151_3=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader:</font> Who is this girl? Her face is unfamiliar to me.
move_4151_4=<font color="#ffff00">Gardener:</font> Isn't she a new Flower Girl? This newcomer is very handy at the nursery.
move_4151_5=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader:</font> We haven't accepted any new Flower Girls lately... Insolent girl! How dare you sneak into my Palace!
move_4151_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I only wish to join the palace…please do not be angry.
move_4151_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> One day, I met a Palace disciple, Chu Xiangwan, out on her travels. We came to talking and she was willing to assist me.
move_4151_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I was able to find the Palace thanks to Chu Xiangwan, but I accidentally found myself in the flower nursery. The master gardener mistook me for a new Flower Girl. So you see, I am no spy. This is the token she gave me.
move_4151_9=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader:</font> Hmm... Since Chu Xiangwan saw it fit to send you here, then you may stay as a Flower Girl. Find me later at the main hall.
move_4151_10=<font color="#ffff00">Gardener:</font> Of course.
move_4151_11=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Thank you, my lady!
move_4154_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> My lady, I hear that you...
move_4154_2=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader:</font> You again! I thought I told you to leave the Palace at once!

move_4154_5=<font color="#ffff00">Attendant:</font> Come on, you! Wake up, sleepy head...
move_4154_6=<font color="#ffff00">Attendant:</font> The Palace Leader hates vulgar things. What possessed you to give them to her? It's a good thing she showed mercy on you.
move_4154_7=<font color="#ffff01">Attendant:</font> Try another way to appease the Palace Leader.
move_4156_1=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader:</font>Yueying, show our new disciple around. Let her be familiar with the palace.
move_4156_2=<font color="#ffff00">Hua Yueying:</font> Yes, my lady!
move_4156_3=<font color="#ffff00">Hua Yueying:</font> The Palace Leader is normally at the Lengjin Wintersweet Pavilion, located at the center of the Palace of Shifting Flowers. The Palace Leader is very busy, so don't bother her with the daily trifles.
move_4156_4=<font color="#ffff00">Hua Yueying:</font> This is the Xichi Palace. It is situated to the north of the Palace of Shifting Flowers and houses the Palace Leader's bedchambers.
move_4156_5=<font color="#ffff00">Hua Yueying:</font> This is the Suxu Palace. It is situated to the northwest of the Palace of Shifting Flowers and houses the Second Palace Leader's bedchambers.
move_4156_6=<font color="#ffff00">Hua Yueying:</font> This is the Yanchi Palace at the northeast of the Palace of Shifting Flowers. It houses the Young Master's bedchambers.
move_4156_7=<font color="#ffff00">Hua Yueying:</font> Here is the Library, Basic Questions Pavilion and the Sword Striking Pavilion. These buildings are located to the southwest of the Palace of Shifting Flowers. If you need any supplies, you should come here.
move_4156_8=<font color="#ffff00">Hua Yueying:</font> This is the Biluo Palace, located at the southeast of the Palace of Shifting Flowers. Disciples may rest here.
move_4156_9=<font color="#ffff00">Hua Yueying:</font> There are several important rules all Palace of Shifting Flowers disciples must follow.
move_4156_10=<font color="#ffff00">Hua Yueying:</font> First, you must wear Palace uniform within the Palace.
move_4156_11=<font color="#ffff00">Hua Yueying:</font> Second, you must speak and act cautiously inside the Palace, and refrain from making loud noises.
move_4156_12=<font color="#ffff00">Hua Yueying:</font> Third, the Palace of Shifting Flowers has high requirements for personal character; you must cultivate your temperament as well as your martial arts.
move_4156_13=<font color="#ffff00">Hua Yueying:</font> The palace takes its rules very seriously. If you violate them, you will be punished and denied any lessons of martial arts, or even be stripped of your powers and banished.
move_4156_14=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I will be sure to follow the rules.
movie_7000_1=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Bieqing:</font><font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>, I hear you have been challenging disciples of other schools to duels and injuring them! Is that true?
movie_7000_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Headmaster, I am tired of the Scholars' life, always painting and showing off literary skill all day long. I want to go out into Jianghu and test my skills!
movie_7000_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Bieqing:</font> It seems you and the Scholars have come to different paths. Well, I won't force you to remain in the Scholars. But we taught you your martial arts...
movie_7000_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Bieqing:</font> How about this: if you can withstand three moves from me and remain standing, then you can keep your martial arts and leave. Otherwise, you must destroy your own martial arts!
movie_7000_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I shall comply with the Headmaster's decree!
movie_7000_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Begin!
movie_7000_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Bieqing:</font> Take this!

movie_7001_1=<font color="#ffff00">Huangfu Yao:</font><font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>, I hear you want to quit the Royal Guards. Is this true?
movie_7001_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> We get called around and ordered about every day. Whenever we're outside, we're seen as court lackeys. Is it any wonder I want to quit?
movie_7001_3=<font color="#ffff00">Huangfu Yao:</font> Ha ha ha! Well said! It seems as though I haven't exercised my muscles in quite some time. You thought that you could merely come and go from the Royal Guards as you please?
movie_7001_4=<font color="#ffff00">Huangfu Yao:</font> I'm going to nullify your martial arts and then feed you to the dogs, piece by piece!
movie_7001_5=<font color="#ffff00">Huangfu Yao:</font> Take him outside!
movie_7001_6=<font color="#ffff00">Royal Guards:</font> Yes, Sir!
move_7002_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>: I killed to save a life. What is wrong with that?
move_7002_2=<font color="#ffff00">Arhat Hall Chief Monk</font>: Such impudence! A monk must have mercy and cannot kill on a whim! Have you forgotten the vows you took when you entered Shaolin!
move_7002_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>: Buddha is compassionate, but he can also strike down like a Vajra at times! These robbers dared to commit their crimes at the foot of Shaolin, I only killed them to placate Buddha's fury.
move_7002_4=<font color="#ffff00">Arhat Hall Chief Monk</font>: Blasphemy! Robbery is a crime but it is not a capital offense. You killed these people indiscriminately. What is the difference, then, between you and a demon? Thoughtless murder will be justly punished!
move_7002_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>: That calligrapher was on the brink of death. I only killed the wicked to save the innocent. I refuse to accept your judgment!
move_7002_6=<font color="#ffff00">Arhat Hall Chief Monk</font>: Such stubbornness! Blasphemy, I say! Where are the Arhat Officers! Take him away! Give him eighteen lashes immediately!
move_7002_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>: I refuse to accept your judgment! I refuse it! Ah...
move_7002_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>: I refuse to accept your judgment! I have acted where heaven could not! Buddha cannot punish the wicked. It is up to me to enforce divine justice! I refuse to accept your judgment!
move_7002_9=<font color="#ffff00">Arhat Hall Chief Monk</font>: Blasphemy! Destroy his martial arts skills! And drive him from Shaolin!

movietalk_3013_2=The last thing I remember is us fighting with servants from Master Chang's house. Did they throw us in here?

movietalk_3013_4=It appears that someone named Hentian Xie was gravely wounded by his disciple. He left his Hentian Technique script here, hoping to find a successor.

move_7003_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>: My lady, I have been cultivating my skills at the Palace for quite some time. In spite of this, I have yet to learn any advanced skills. When can I begin to learn more powerful martial arts?
move_7003_2=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader</font>: Our internal skills emphasize gradual progression. You have only just joined the Palace and lack the necessary temperament. A profound understanding of the introductory skills is required. Do not be impatient. You will have your turn to learn advanced skills.
move_7003_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: Every time I ask, you say the same thing that I have not been here long enough. I can recite every word of the novice mental skill backwards and forwards. Why do you still refuse to teach me?
move_7003_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: If Palace Leader is unwilling to teach me advanced Palace of Shifting Flowers skills, then I do not wish to waste my time anymore. I ask the Palace Leader's permission to leave the Palace and seek advance martial arts on my own.
move_7003_5=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader</font>: The Palace of Shifting Flowers is different from those sinister cults that forbid new members from ever leaving. However, the Palace will not condone its adherents to come and go as they please. If you want to leave, fine, but you may not take the Shifting Flowers skills with you.
move_7003_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: What! You have no right to do that! I worked hard to cultivate these skills! If you won't let me go, I'll leave by myself!
move_7003_7=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader</font>: Traitor!
move_7003_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: Aaaargh!
move_7003_9=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Leader</font>: She has been stripped of her martial arts! Heal her and take her away.
movie_7006_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: (Thinking for a moment...) Jianghu is as big as my heart. Day in and day out, I work with the five poisons. Even if I have martial arts, I still do not know the world. I think I am more suited for the carefree Jianghu life.
movie_7006_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: Headmaster, I have something to report for which I need your opinion!
movie_7006_3=<font color="#ffff00">Shan Tianming</font>: Speak quickly. If you tell the truth, I will take responsibility and decide for you!
movie_7006_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: Last night, when I was feeding the poison pitcher and accidentally put in the wrong herb, causing all of the insects in poison pitchers to die. For this, I was severely punished by the pitcher producer and I lament the fact that my life is worth less than an insect's. Therefore, I wish to leave Wanderer's Valley. I hope Headmaster will approve!
movie_7006_5=<font color="#ffff00">Shan Tianming</font>: A country has its laws, and so does a school. Since you've entered Wanderer's Valley, obeying school regulations is the least you can do. The incident last night was your fault, so punishment was inevitable. You are still young and pliable. Remember this lesson and never repeat it, and never mention leaving the school again!
movie_7006_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: I have joined the school for a year but I find life here dull. We take care of poison insects and plants day in and day out, and need to be careful not to destroy the poison. This is not the kind of life I had envisioned. My mind is made up, and I wish to leave the school. I hope Headmaster will grant me permission!
movie_7006_7=<font color="#ffff00">Shan Tianming</font>: (Thinks for a moment...) Since your mind has been made up, I have nothing more to say. Leaving Wanderer's Valley is fine, but you must give up all of the martial arts you learned in the Valley. Henceforth, you shall have no association whatsoever with Wanderer's Valley. But remember, you will be on your own. Always look out for yourself out there!
movie_7006_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: That is what I asked for. My departure means there is just one less Wanderer's Valley disciple!

movie_7009_3=<font color="#ffff00">Huang Guxiao</font>: What is it?
movie_7009_7=<font color="#ffff00">Huang Guxiao</font>: How dare you insult us and belittle our martial arts. You are a lazy, ignorant fool! I'll teach you a lesson you won't soon forget!
movie_7009_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: I'm leaving anyway. So what if I get slapped around a few more times?
movie_5866_1=<font color="#ffff00">Cui Yiluan:</font> Shifu just let that traitor to our school go so easily?
movie_5866_2=<font color="#ffff00">Cui Yiluan:</font> Shifu, Martial Sister has been in league with cultists and has made a mockery of Emei's regulations. She has already planned to elope with her lover.
movie_5866_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Shifu, Martial Sister has slandered me.
movie_5866_4=<font color="#ffff00">Cui Yiluan:</font> We'll let Shifu decide. But I saw everything that happened when you had a rendezvous with your lover. You seemed quite happy, didn't you!
movie_5866_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> You scoundrel, you scoundrel! You have ignored me for so long without coming to see me. I shall ignore you from now on.

movie_5866_9=<font color="#ffff00">Martial Brother Dan:</font> Martial Sister, something's happened in my school but I'll be there to see you soon. Please don't be angry with me.
movie_5866_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> There's a lot of people coming and going here. It wouldn't be wise to let Martial Sisters see this. Shifu has always had some opinions about you. Let's go somewhere else and get some fresh air.
movie_5866_11=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> You're lying.
movie_5866_12=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Shifu, please punish Martial Sister and give me my justice.
movie_5866_13=<font color="#ffff00">Cui Yiluan:</font> Humph! Justice, eh? Well, try this on for size then, Martial Sister!
movie_5866_14=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Ah! Why do you have Martial Brother Dan's jade pendant? (Damn... I accidently gave it away)
movie_5866_15=<font color="#ffff00">Cui Yiluan:</font> Look at this, Shifu. Martial Sister and her lover's name are carved on it.
movie_5866_16=<font color="#ffff00">Abbess Juechen:</font><font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>, is this true? I doted on you so but it was all for nothing, I see. You degenerate! You are in league with cultists and monsters! It looks like I will have to clean house today.
movie_5866_17=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Listen to me Shifu, it is not what you think.
movie_5866_18=<font color="#ffff00">Abbess Juechen:</font><font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>, I'll give you one chance to redeem yourself. Go kill him, and I won't investigate your crimes any further.
movie_5866_19=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I can't, Shifu. Martial Brother Dan did nothing wrong! Why kill him?
movie_5866_20=<font color="#ffff00">Abbess Juechen:</font> I see you are stubborn and unrepentant, and are completely spellbound. Well, I'll grant you your wish.

movie_7004_2=<font color="#ffff00">Immortal Ziyang:</font> What? You wish to leave Wudang? I observed you practicing martial arts quite diligently some days ago. Why do you wish to leave?
movie_7004_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Some days ago, I saw something happen in a tea house in Longnan Village at the foot of the mountain. Dimwitted and foolish as I am, I could not get it out of my mind. What is the Way of Kung Fu? Does justice truly exist in the world?
movie_7004_4=<font color="#ffff00">Immortal Ziyang:</font> Go ahead and tell me what you encountered.
movie_7004_5=<font color="#ffff00">Ruffian:</font> Where is the manager!
movie_7004_6=<font color="#ffff00">Tea House Owner:</font> I'm the manager. Great Hero, may I interest you in a cup of tea?

movie_7004_8=<font color="#ffff00">Tea House Owner:</font> You! You think you can just rob me in broad daylight? I've had my store here at the foothills of Wudang Mountain for a long time without ever having to pay any protection money. Why don't we go to Immortal Ziyang for his judgment!
movie_7004_9=<font color="#ffff00">Ruffian:</font> Judgment? I'm the judge and jury! Now hurry up with my silver, why don't you!
movie_7004_10=<font color="#ffff00">Tea House Owner:</font> Well, I don't have money... Only my life.
movie_7004_11=<font color="#ffff00">Ruffian:</font> Ha! I would enjoy taking that just as well! Prepare to meet your maker!
movie_7004_12=<font color="#ffff00">Tea House Owner:</font> Ah...
movie_7004_13=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> The tea house owner was beaten to death! Is there no justice in this world?!
movie_7004_14=<font color="#ffff00">Immortal Ziyang:</font> Sigh, Jianghu is a dangerous place. Not everyone understands the ways of heaven in the same way, one should accept fate as it is!
movie_7004_15=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I want to decide my own fate by leaving Wudang and seeking answers on my own. I no longer wish to have any association with the Wudang school!
movie_7004_16=<font color="#ffff00">Immortal Ziyang:</font> Foolish disciple! Come back to your senses and continue your studies on the mountain!

movie_7005_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang:</font> Go home to your young master and tell him that if he dares to cause trouble again in Beggar's Sect territory, I will not spare him next time!
movie_7005_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I thank the Leader for his help! I have thought about this long and hard. I wish to leave the Beggar's Sect.
movie_7005_9=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang:</font> What? You want to leave Beggar's Sect? We have many disciples who work together to help each other. Why would you want to leave?
movie_7005_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I, I can't stand this life of poverty any longer! I was begging in Luoyang, a wealthy youth commanded a servant to feed me leftover steamed bread. I didn't want to eat them and ran, and then the servants chased me all the way here. The rest you saw yourself!
movie_7005_11=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Why do I have to spend my life being poor and be discriminated by others? I want to leave the Beggar's Sect!
movie_7005_12=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang:</font> Huh, so you look down on the Beggar's Sect? Who helped you back when you were cornered and had nowhere to go? Have you forgotten all of the kindness you received?
movie_7005_13=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Kindness? Having me beg all day on my knees! You call this kindness? If that's your brand of kindness, then I'm leaving!

movie_7005_15=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> It matters not! I won't stay in Beggar's Sect another day! Don't try to stop me!
movie_7005_16=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Tianfang:</font> Humph! Nobody simply joins and leaves the Beggar's Sect whenever they please! Leave your Beggar's Sect martial arts with you! Take this!

movie_7007_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Tianchi</font>: Why do you wish to leave Xu Family Manor?
movie_7007_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: The martial arts of Xu Family Manor are technical and skillful, but lack valor and majesty. I want to go to Jianghu to learn more powerful martial arts!
movie_7007_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng</font>: You're the first one to criticize Xu Family Manor's martial arts in front of me. Let me show you the true power of Xu Family martial arts!
movie_7007_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: Please enlighten me, Villa Leader.
movie_7007_6=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng</font>: You think Xu Family Manor martial arts is weak because you are like a frog stuck inside the bottom of a well that has no concept of the outer world! Your ignorance blinds you.
movie_7007_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Tianchi</font>: Humph! Not even the Chief dares to underestimate the Xu Family jade ruler!
movie_7007_8=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Yunzheng</font>: Ahh. You may go, then. Although I took away your martial arts, I hope you can remember to be chivalrous. The roads of Jianghu are dangerous and unforgiving...
movie_7008_1=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Feng</font>: What are you brawling about down there?
movie_7008_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: Grandmother, I don't want to refine poisons anymore! We spend our days mixing and creating poisons, I've had enough!
movie_7008_3=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Feng</font>: You fool! You cannot tame poison if you don't test the poison on yourself.
movie_7008_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: In any case, I won't create any more poison. I want to leave Tangmen!
movie_7008_5=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Feng</font>: In that case, drink this cup of medicinal wine first. It can remove the toxins in your body. We'll talk afterwards.
movie_7008_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}</font>: Ah! This isn't medicine! It's poison!
movie_7008_7=<font color="#ffff00">Tang Feng</font>: Humph! This poison wine just takes away your poison skills! Isn't that what you wanted?!

movie_7021_6=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Di: </font>No one is to blame—Lin Yunyu's Kung Fu is beyond your abilities. I'm issuing a decree to give all the treasure of Lin Yunyu to the hero who hunts him down!

movie_7024_3=<font color="#ffff02">Jianghu Someone: </font>belle is the one temptation common to man and hero. Lin Yunyu's got a nerve competing with the emperor for a mistress, but ends up losing everything
movie_7024_4=<font color="#ffff03">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Sure enough, it has become a very hot issue in Jianghu—
movie_7025_1=<font color="#ffff00">Story Teller:</font> Zhu Di is fierce. He used to offend his superior, contest the throne with any cost, and disturb the order of court. Zhu Di is a lascivious hypocrite. At that year, he did many bad things to get Xu Miaozhen. Xu Miaozhen and Ling Yunyu was broken by him. Then Xu Miaozhen had to be a nun in Emei, and Ling Yunyu's families were killed by Zhu Di. Now the heaven dog is eating the sun. There must be a punishment on Zhu Di!

movie_7026_4=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Heroine Xu—
movie_7026_5=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Reporting in! Many people in the Imperial Palace have become mentally disordered, spreading the lies of the emperor's misdeeds. They must be envenomed.

movie_3518_3=<font color="#ffff00">The Black Robe: </font>Not that, look there—
movie_3518_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Then, what am I supposed to do?
movie_3518_7=<font color="#ffff00">The Black Robe: </font>He must be very fidgety now.
movie_3519_1=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>Nobody absent? Very well, let's get started.
movie_3519_2=45 minutes later—
movie_3519_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> (How lucky I was with all the money won)
movie_3519_4=<font color="#ffff00">Lady Hundred Flowers: </font>Gee, how did you stay calm—the stakes are so high for this game, making me nervous with a rapid heartbeat.
movie_3519_5=<font color="#ffff00">Lady Hundred Flowers: </font>The flirtation of you, oldster Lu, neglected your duty as the bookmaker. Instead, your staring eyes have been scanning my body from top to bottom. [snort] I'm in for this game, and you will pay for what it's been caused.
movie_3519_6=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Lixian: </font>You got a very good hand, but the hand I was dealt was—
movie_3519_7=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Lixian: </font>Sky Set it is. You lose.
movie_3519_8=<font color="#ffff00">Lady Hundred Flowers: </font>It—it can't be true!
movie_3519_9=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Lixian: </font>That happens. You'll have to live with it.
movie_3519_10=<font color="#ffff00">Lady Hundred Flowers: </font>Lu Lixian, you won, this time, I'll get revenge!
movie_3520_1=<font color="#ffff00">Lady Hundred Flowers: </font>Lu Lixian, what do you think you are up to? You gave me your hint and am I not supposed to lose the game?
movie_3520_2=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Lixian: </font>Oh sweetheart, we're engaged to be married. Why would I trick you? That was just a slip-up.
movie_3520_5=<font color="#ffff00">Lady Hundred Flowers: </font>Oops—I'm just kidding! Lord Lu—
movie_3520_6=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Lixian: </font>Beat it!
movie_3520_7=<font color="#ffff00">Lady Hundred Flowers: </font>[laughter] So you are rootless—, to my shame I didn't figure that out in the beginning.
movie_3520_8=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Lixian: </font>Your low-down behavior spoiled my intention to spare your life, [snort], you asked for it!
movie_3520_9=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Lixian: </font>Ah!
movie_3520_10=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>What's all this about?
movie_3520_12=<font color="#ffff00">Lady Hundred Flowers: </font>—
movie_3521_1=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>Here we go.
movie_3521_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>The way Tan Zhi dealt cards has set me thinking that he is a very powerful opponent.
movie_3521_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Lu Lixian, though fidgety is trying to appear calm, is that because of his unhealed injury or—
movie_3521_4=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Lixian: </font>I'm lucky so far—
movie_3521_5=<font color="#ffff00">Tan Zhi: </font>Put it down.
movie_3521_6=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Lixian: </font>What?
movie_3521_7=<font color="#ffff00">Tan Zhi: </font>Show us that card up your sleeve.
movie_3521_8=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Lixian: </font>Tan Zhi, stop fitting me up with your vicious slander!
movie_3521_9=<font color="#ffff00">Tan Zhi: </font>[snort]
movie_3521_12=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Lixian: </font>No—
movie_3522_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>So you plan to get rid of an opponent here to increase your chance of winning the last game?
movie_3522_3=<font color="#ffff00">Tan Zhi: </font>Only one survivor between us is enough.
movie_3522_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Oh, Tan Zhi, I've been trying to figure you out. When I got a look at the Champions Invitations of Ma Xingxing, Lady Hundred Flowers and Lu Lixian, it dawned on me that you guys boarded with the same purpose.
movie_3522_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>The Tie Family were known to be slaughtered in full ten years ago, while the murderer has been at large. Now it turns out unexpectedly that the lovely Lady Hundred Flowers survived it, determined to avenge her family.
movie_3522_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>It turned out that both Ma Xingxing and Lu Lixian are butchers of the murder, more unexpectedly, the mastermind behind the plan of the murder is Tan Zhi, a general!
movie_3522_7=<font color="#ffff00">Tan Zhi: </font>[snort] So where's proof?
movie_3522_11=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Because I am the one who got the real Sky Set (Annotation: The Sky Set contains exactly a 6-point red dice together with a 6-point white dice).
movie_3522_12=<font color="#ffff00">Tan Zhi: </font>You—all right then, now that you knew I was the mastermind behind the plan of the murder, you should continue to find out that I am also a very good on-site murder!
movie_3523_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>For the one last game, here comes the opponent—Hell King.
movie_3523_3=<font color="#ffff00">The Black Robe: </font>Those who boarded wish to get back their secrets, only to find they are losing more of their secrets.
movie_3523_4=<font color="#ffff00">The Black Robe: </font>Eventually, those useless men will be sent back to Central Plains with no memory of the happenings, leaving a legend of sudden wealth behind.
movie_3523_5=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>Unwilling to reveal your hand? Daren't do that or attempt to deny?
movie_3523_7=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>I'm the Hell King. I know what kind of a person you are and what you did—
movie_3523_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>You have no idea how's my hand.
movie_3523_9=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font> Why don't you just reveal the card?
movie_3523_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>You thought you are skilled in shuffling the cards and you have all the cards at your fingertips. Get a look at Tan Zhi. I'm telling you, you are not the only one who can do so.
movie_3523_11=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>He? He was dead. What could a dead man do?
movie_3523_12=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>He left a card from another set here in this set!
movie_3523_13=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>It—it can't be true!
movie_3523_14=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Tan Zhi is no fool, he found out all the marks you left on each card, and managed to turn the game to his advantage.
movie_3523_15=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> You are so high-and-mighty so that I can safely assume that you have the intention to defeat me by the biggest set, so I managed to take advantage of your plan—
movie_3523_16=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>You lose!
movie_3523_17=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>—Well played! I'd been in this game for years, without a single defeat, can't imagine I've been bested by a Jianghu new generation like you!
movie_3524_2=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>[laughter] I'm just a copycat of Hell King!
movie_3524_3=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>Now you have no chance of escape. I've ordered them to destroy the keel of the boat—
movie_3524_4=<font color="#ffff00">The Black Robe: </font>So he is the person who destroyed the boat, right?
movie_3524_5=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>You! You are—no wonder an unworthy new generation can go this far, you're guided by somebody—
movie_3524_6=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>The Invincible Ten lived up to my expectations. I regret not heeding the ruler's advice.
movie_3524_7=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>What do you think you are doing? I'm not telling you the secret—Not on your life!
movie_3524_8=<font color="#ffff00">The Black Robe: </font> You are not essential for us. This homing pigeon alone is enough to guide us, all we need to do is to follow it.
movie_3524_9=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>You are getting on the island?! You—you!!!!
movie_3524_10=<font color="#ffff00">Hell King: </font>You! If you'd like to stay alive, don't be taken in by any part of his words! If you insist on further investigation into the truth, you are sure to get confused, just like me—
movie_3524_11=<font color="#ffff00">The Black Robe: </font>You talk too much and get killed. Now dump the corpses into the sea. Steer after the homing pigeon.
movie_3524_12=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>What if I say no?
movie_3524_13=<font color="#ffff00">The Black Robe: </font>Then, it shall be the last word you've said in your life!

movie_1506_8=<font color="#ffff00">General: </font>Forgive me. I accept all responsibility.
movie_1506_9=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>It's an inside job, your grace. As you well know, the East Chamber is closely connected with the imperial authorities. Their spies are everywhere.
movie_1506_10=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaochi: </font>Go, kill the intruders. I'll deal with you later.
movie_1506_11=<font color="#ffff00">General: </font>Immediately, your grace.
movie_1506_12=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Your grace, these are our allies, here to join our cause at my request.
movie_1506_13=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaochi: </font>Very well, what shall we do next?
movie_1506_14=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>The East Chamber must have dispatched their few highly-trained assassins ahead of their main forces. I suggest we send the imperial army to fight the East Chamber rebels, and let the palace guards secure the forbidden city.
movie_1506_15=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>These heroes will fight alongside the imperial army. Your grace, you must go to the emperor right away and mobilize every man we have left in the garrison.
movie_1506_16=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaochi: </font>Sound plan. We will do as you say.
movie_1511_1=<font color="#ffff00">Defending Officer: </font>This area is forbidden. Leave or die!
movie_1511_2=<font color="#ffff00">Garrison Officer: </font>We've been ordered to defend the emperor, and kill anyone who gets in our way. That includes you, if you dare to cause any trouble.
movie_1511_3=<font color="#ffff00">Garrison Officer: </font>You are all at the mercy of the emperor. It is you who will leave, or die.
movie_1511_4=<font color="#ffff00">Defending Officer: </font>Nonsense! The East Chamber are attacking the city. Instead of stopping them, why have you come directly to the palace?
movie_1511_5=<font color="#ffff00">Defending Officer: </font>State your intentions here at the palace. Our enemies are everywhere!
movie_1511_6=<font color="#ffff00">Garrison Officer: </font>I don't have to waste my time with the likes you. Cavalry, prepare to charge!
movie_1511_7=<font color="#ffff00">Defending Officer: </font>Archers, prepare to fire!
movie_1511_8=<font color="#ffff00">??? </font>What's going on?
movie_1511_9=<font color="#ffff00">Defending Officer: </font>Your majesty!
movie_1511_10=<font color="#ffff00">Garrison Officer: </font>Your majesty!
movie_1511_11=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Di: </font>Why so many soldiers here? Are we in danger?
movie_1511_12=<font color="#ffff00">Garrison Officer: </font>We've been ordered to protect you! We were told the imperial army are in open revolt!
movie_1511_13=<font color="#ffff00">Garrison Officer: </font>I…please forgive me for the misunderstanding. I accept full responsibility for disturbing the peace.
movie_1511_14=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Di: </font>You have done us no wrong. You may rise.
movie_1511_15=<font color="#ffff00">Defending Officer: </font>Thank you, your majesty!
movie_1511_16=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Di: </font>Now go, do your duty and defeat the real rebels in the city!
movie_1511_17=<font color="#ffff00">Garrison Officer: </font>Right away, your majesty!

movie_1511_19=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>What's our next move?
movie_1511_20=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Go to the emperor. I'll stay here to secure the situation.
movie_1511_21=<font color="#ffff00">Palace Guard: </font>Sir, asassins are attacking the palace in full force! We're resisting them!
movie_1511_22=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>What? This is worse than I thought…
movie_1511_23=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Go now! Protect the emperor and the prince!
movie_1512_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>I sense we're near the end of this crisis. I'm on my way!
movie_1512_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>How could this be?
movie_1512_3=<font color="#ffff00">Wang Kun: </font>Ha ha, I'm justing playing with you. If you think you can ever hurt me, dream on.
movie_1512_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaochi: </font>You rebel scum. My palace guards will finish you.
movie_1512_5=<font color="#ffff00">Wang Kun: </font>Oh, but where are those palace guards of yours? All I see is here is the last runt of a dying dynasty.
movie_1512_6=<font color="#ffff00">Wang Kun: </font>Your palace guards cannot save you this time!
movie_1512_7=<font color="#ffff00">Wang Kun: </font>No one can stop me today!
movie_1512_8=<font color="#ffff00">Wang Kun: </font>I will be emperor today…what's this?
movie_1512_9=<font color="#ffff00">Wang Kun: </font>You!
movie_1512_10=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Sorry I'm late. Please forgive me.
movie_1512_11=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaochi: </font>At least you got here just in time.
movie_1512_12=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaochi: </font>Wang Kun, what do you think of your chances now of becoming our next emperor?
movie_1512_13=<font color="#ffff00">Wang Kun: </font>You think he is here to protect you? Ha ha ha…
movie_1512_14=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>A dead man does not speak, Wang Kun.
movie_1512_15=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Your grace, I've killed the rebel leader. The Royal Guards are protecting the city. This place is now secure.
movie_1512_16=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Your grace, please go to the emperor now to restore peace to our city.
movie_1512_17=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Gaochi: </font>My father is not at the great hall.
movie_1512_18=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>The emperor said that he had some personal affairs to attend to. Only the Four Elites were to accompany him.
movie_1512_19=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>I'm afraid we have yet to see how this day will end.
movie_1513_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Your majesty!
movie_1513_2=<font color="#ffff00">Su Honghong (female): </font>Take the emperor and go. I'll stop them!

movie_1514_6=<font color="#ffff00">Su Honghong (female): </font>Let us go, or I cannot guarantee the emperor's safety.
movie_1514_7=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Well, well, take a look at who's with me now.
movie_1514_8=<font color="#ffff00">Su Honghong (female): </font>You! Let him go, or…
movie_1514_9=<font color="#ffff00">Su Honghong (male): </font> Aaarrgh….
movie_1514_10=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>I'm counting to three. Let the emperor go, or he dies.

movie_1514_20=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuo Bei: </font>Hmph, never let a woman do a man's job.
movie_1514_21=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Zhuo Bei, you made use of the East Chamber Master's rebellion to kidnap the emperor, and take the He Family Jade. I am impressed that you got this far.
movie_1514_22=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuo Bei: </font>Wo Weihuang, though I failed to take the emperor alive, I can still come out ahead this day.
movie_1514_23=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuo Bei: </font>As long as Zhu Di dies, this world as we know it will die with him.
movie_1514_24=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>A moment, please! I have the two pieces of the He Jade: the Yin and Yang Talismen of Life!
movie_1514_25=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Let's settle this as gentlemen - a duel at the imperial barracks. The victor shall have the emperor's life, as well as the He Jade in its entirety.
movie_1514_26=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuo Bei: </font>It's a deal!
movie_1515_1=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Hmm!
movie_1515_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>No!
movie_1515_3=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuqing: </font>I……Junke! Why didn't you dodge?
movie_1515_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Wuqing, I'm so glad I can get to see you again…
movie_1515_5=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuqing: </font>I'm glad to see you too. Hang in there, we'll take you to a healer…
movie_1515_6=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>The two talismen shall become one once again!
movie_1515_7=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Protect the emperor!
movie_1515_8=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Your majesty, why did you……
movie_1515_9=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Di: </font>I'm old, but I'm not muddle-headed.
movie_1515_10=<font color="#ffff00">An Ruosu: </font>Welcome, leader. I trust you are well.
movie_1515_11=<font color="#ffff00">Ming Shiyue: </font>Thank you, I am.

movie_1515_13=<font color="#ffff00">Ming Shiyue: </font>Ha ha, it's good to taste mayhem and murder in the air again. Ah, jianghu, how I have missed you…
movie_5304_1=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Brother Chu, Wuqing…
movie_5304_2=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuo Bei: </font>Chu Xiao, give us Mo Wuqing. Then we'll let you go.
movie_5304_3=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>Junke, take her away now! I'll stop them!
movie_5304_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Brother Chu, take care!
movie_5304_5=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>Well, come on, then. Defeat me, or you can never catch up with them!
movie_5304_6=<font color="#ffff00">Elder Huadi: </font>You want to stop us by yourself?
movie_5304_7=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuo Bei: </font>Watch out! Throwing knife!
movie_5304_8=<font color="#ffff00">Elder Huadi: </font>Ha ha, they say Chu Xiao's flying daggers are unrivaled. So it was just another hype.
movie_5304_9=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuo Bei: </font>How can this be…
movie_5304_10=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>Eh...
movie_5304_11=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuo Bei: </font>Indeed, the Fifteenth Seal of the Tangmen. Most impressive.
movie_5304_12=<font color="#ffff00">Elder Huadi: </font>(Cough cough) Very cleve of you to use a Tangmen trick to defeat my technique. That should be your crowning achievement before your death.
movie_5304_13=<font color="#ffff00">>Elder Huadi: </font>However, I'm not out of my bag of tricks just yet…ha ha…
movie_5421_1=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>Hmph! To bully the weak like that! Have you no shame?
movie_5421_2=<font color="#ffff00">Elder Shi Que: </font>Heyhey...
movie_5421_3=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>Eh...
movie_5421_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuo Bei:</font>Go!
movie_5421_5=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>Damn you!
movie_5515_1=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>Everyone in Qiandeng Town has been captured. The people you see are all enemies disguised as the locals.
movie_5515_2=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>They are waiting for Xing Junke's arrival to attack him.
movie_5515_3=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>With your help, they can be defeated easily.
movie_5516_1=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>Thank you!
movie_5516_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>You are welcome. What's our plan?
movie_5516_3=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>My sworn sister is seriously hurt. My sworn brother is on his way to the herbal hall for medicine.
movie_5516_4=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>The herbal hall is in enemy territory. I'm afraid something may happen to my sworn brother when he gets there.
movie_5516_5=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>We need your help in clearing any ambush.
movie_5516_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Of course. I'll take care of them.
movie_5516_7=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>We are greatly outnumbered, so we need to reduce their advantage.
movie_5516_8=<font color="#ffff01">Chu Xiao: </font>Put on their clothes to disguise yourself as one of them. Then kill them one by one in stealth.
movie_5516_9=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Sounds like a plan.
movie_5516_10=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>Thank you. I am in your debt.
movie_5517_1=<font color="#ffff01">Xing Junke: </font>Doctor, can you come with me to save my friend's life?
movie_5517_2=<font color="#ffff01">Doctor: </font>Of course, please lead the way.

movie_5518_1=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Where is your sword?
movie_5518_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Do not be concerned. I've been advised by Elder Ye.
movie_5518_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>It no longer matters whether I wield a sword. We will have a fair match.
movie_5518_4=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>As you wish. Do you have the item I want?
movie_5518_5=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>You are as good as your word.
movie_5518_6=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Where is Wuqing?
movie_5518_7=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Let's get started.
movie_5518_8=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Very well.
movie_5518_9=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Come, show me what Elder Ye has just taught you.
movie_5518_10=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Cough, cough.
movie_5518_11=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>I've won!
movie_5518_12=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Young hall leader…you are a worthy opponent. I am defeated.
movie_5518_13=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Now, please hand over the He Family Jade, as we've agreed.
movie_5518_14=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>I have it right here. Come and get it.
movie_5518_15=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>The jade is already mine, once and for all. I can wait until I get to show it to everyone.
movie_5518_16=<font color="#ffff00">???: </font>Impressive!
movie_5518_17=<font color="#ffff00">???: </font>So you got here before me, Mr. Zhuo.
movie_5518_18=<font color="#ffff00">Su Honghong: </font>I've been here for some time. Why haven't you even greeted me?
movie_5518_19=<font color="#ffff00">???: </font>Well, it is certainly a pleasure to meet you.
movie_5518_20=<font color="#ffff00">???: </font>Now that we've dispensed with the pleasantries, let me say that none of you shall escape my grasp this day.
movie_5518_21=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Elder Huadi, I didn't think you would come. This is indeed an eventful day!
movie_5519_1=<font color="#ffff00">Yan Shuangxing:</font> Let's go.
movie_5519_2=<font color="#ffff00">Su Honghong: </font>You've broken the He Family Jade into two pieces!
movie_5520_1=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>Brother Chu, I'll help you.
movie_5520_2=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Xing Junke, defeat Ye Jinglou and bring his the Talisman of Life to me. In exchange, I will let you have the Mo girl.
movie_5520_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke:</font> Elder Ye…
movie_5520_4=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>This is between him and me. It is no longer your concern.
movie_5520_5=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>If you fancy that girl, then take her.
movie_5520_6=<font color="#ffff00">Xing Junke: </font>I…
movie_5520_7=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>Now.
movie_5520_8=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>Now, leave.
movie_5609_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I'm finally here! Where is Ao Xinxiong?
movie_5609_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> They are Ao Xinxiong's trusted followers. They may know something.
movie_5609_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I have to find a way to get the warden's key.
movie_5609_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I'll play finger-guessing with him and get him drunk. Then I can take his key.
movie_5610_1=<font color="#ffff00">Eunuch: </font>Royal Guards Commander Huangfu Yao, you are herby given an imperial edict!
movie_5610_2=<font color="#ffff00">Eunuch: </font>From now on, Royal Guards' duties in the imperial city will be transferred to the East Chamber.
movie_5610_3=<font color="#ffff00">Huangfu Yao: </font>Long live the emperor! His will be done!
movie_5657_1=<font color="#ffff00">Chen Wansan: </font>I'm going to kill you!
movie_5657_2=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Wangzi: </font>How dare you provoke us? Tired of living already?
movie_5657_3=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Gaoguan: </font>Don't you know who I am?
movie_5657_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Stop! You all practice martial arts. Why do you three bully a weak scholar? You should be ashamed of yourselves.
movie_5657_5=<font color="#ffff00">Chen Wansan: </font>Who are you? It's none of your business.
movie_5657_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I will not allow you to bully the weak. So it's my business now.
movie_5657_7=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Gaoguan: </font>Tough talk. Let's see how strong you really are.
movie_5709_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Who the hell are you?
movie_5709_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Ah!
movie_5759_1=<font color="#ffff00">Su Honghong: </font>Valley Leader, We've challenged each other several times already. I'm afraid we're equally matched. If we don't stop now, both of us will be seriously hurt.
movie_5759_2=<font color="#ffff00">Shan Tianming: </font>Haha, agreed. I'll stop now.
movie_5759_3=<font color="#ffff00">Su Honghong: </font>Can it be this easy? If I take it now, the He Jade will never be seen in Wanderer's Valley again.
movie_5759_4=<font color="#ffff00">Shan Tianming: </font>You misunderstood me. We can stop fighting now, but you are not leaving here with the jade.
movie_5759_5=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Master Yu, are you the only one that can recombine the Yin and Yang Talismen of Life, so that the He Jade is whole once again?
movie_5759_6=<font color="#ffff00">Master Yu: </font>So…the Young Hall Leader has his hand in this matter as well. Is it because of him, or are you in this for yourself?
movie_5759_7=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Leader, I must have him!
movie_5759_8=<font color="#ffff00">Su Honghong: </font>Such arrogance. It's just like Ming Shiyue fifteen years ago.
movie_5759_9=<font color="#ffff00">Su Honghong: </font>This was once the headquarters of our cult. It has long been in ruins.
movie_5759_10=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>Fortunes rise and fall. The cult had its moments, now the Zhus will face its downfall. You say I'm arrogant, but I've always been just a dog to the Zhu family.
movie_5759_11=<font color="#ffff00">Su Honghong: </font>Indeed. Very well, I will let Master Yu go with you. I will take your leave now.
movie_5814_1=<font color="#ffff00">Tu Tianlong: </font>It's all yours.
movie_5814_2=<font color="#ffff00">Tu Xiaolong: </font>Don't you know who our leader is? How dare you stick your nose into our business. Kill him!
movie_5814_3=<font color="#ffff00">Servant: </font>Leave now!
movie_5814_4=<font color="#ffff00">Servant: </font>Don't you understand me? Get out of here!
movie_5814_5=<font color="#ffff00">Servant: </font>Aarggh!
movie_5814_6=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>Haha!
movie_5814_7=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>Boss, a jug of wine!
movie_5815_1=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>So, we meet again.
movie_5815_2=<font color="#ffff00">Luo Duoduo: </font>Money makes the world go round.
movie_5815_3=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>You do live up to your reputation as a lover of money.
movie_5815_4=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>So, let's get started.
movie_5815_5=<font color="#ffff00">Luo Duoduo: </font>No rush. I don't want to die just now.
movie_5815_6=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>Oh?
movie_5815_7=<font color="#ffff00">Luo Duoduo: </font>They say no one has ever seen Chu Xiao's throwing knife.
movie_5815_8=<font color="#ffff00">Luo Duoduo: </font>That's because no one has lived to tell about it.
movie_5815_9=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>So you know who I am.
movie_5815_10=<font color="#ffff00">Luo Duoduo: </font>Of course I know who you are. I always do research on people I do business with, especially if the business carries a significant risk.
movie_5815_11=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>So, do you want to kill me?
movie_5815_12=<font color="#ffff00">Luo Duoduo: </font>It would be very profitable for me to kill you. I can use that fact as leverage to make better deals.
movie_5815_13=<font color="#ffff00">Luo Duoduo: </font>So, want to have a drink?
movie_5815_14=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>Are you trying to poison me?
movie_5815_15=<font color="#ffff00">Luo Duoduo: </font>Will you drink or not?
movie_5815_16=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>You think I'm scared of you? Fine, let's drink.
movie_5815_17=<font color="#ffff00">Chu Xiao: </font>So, this is Wine of Living Death. Delicious.
movie_5815_18=<font color="#ffff00">Luo Duoduo: </font>The jug is empty.

movie_5871_19=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuo Bei: </font>The girl? Do whatever you like with her.  Let's meet at the summit of Mount Hua at the night of the full moon.
movie_5871_20=<font color="#ffff00">Wo Weihuang: </font>I'll see you there.
movie_5915_1=<font color="#ffff00">Old Man He: </font>Xiang Jiuchen! You killed my son! You owe me your life!
movie_5915_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xiang Jiuchen: </font>Old Man He, the death of your son was a terrible accident. It's been properly addressed by the headmaster of our school.
movie_5915_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xiang Jiuchen: </font>I bear no guilt for his death, only remorse. You have my sympathies.
movie_5915_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xiang Jiuchen: </font>If you seek revenge in Wudang, just mention my name. The disciples there will not stop you.
movie_5915_5=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>This is absurd. Will you, a trained Wudang warrior, allow yourself to fight an old peasant?
movie_5915_6=<font color="#ffff00">Xiang Jiuchen: </font>What choices do I have? I must avenge my son!
movie_5915_7=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>I have an idea.
movie_5915_8=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>Wudang martial arts are powerful, but not invincible. In my days, I've come to know a certain weakness that we can exploit.
movie_5915_9=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>Though Old Man He is untrained, I am still confident that he can defeat you in three rounds.
movie_5915_10=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>He shall have his revenge, and I shall have the satisfaction of surpassing the Wudang.
movie_5915_11=<font color="#ffff00">Xiang Jiuchen:</font> You will never beat me, by proxy or otherwise. If I win, you must stay in Wudang for three more years.
movie_5915_12=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>Have it your way.
movie_5915_13=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>Old Man He, come with me if you still want your revenge.
movie_5916_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> (These movements are clever, but they will not break Wudang skills at all.)
movie_5916_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> (Ye Jinglou cannot possibly make an martial art expert out of an old man, and in such a short time!)
movie_5917_1=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>Did you see this movement clearly?
movie_5917_2=<font color="#ffff00">Old Man He: </font>Excuse me, you're asking me to stab myself with this blade. Is this suicide?
movie_5917_3=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>Indeed it is. If you try to kill yourself with the blade, Xiang Jiuchen will surely save you. That's the way of the Wudang.
movie_5917_4=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>When he tends your wounds, he will let his guard down. Then you will strike!
movie_5917_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> (This is a trick! Elder Xiang is in danger!)
movie_5917_6=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Elder Brother, I need to speak to the martial uncle. It's very urgent.
movie_5917_7=<font color="#ffff00">Wudang Disciple: </font>Martial Uncle Xiang is meditating in preparation of his match. He said no one is to disturb him.
movie_5917_8=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Please, it's a matter of life and death.
movie_5917_9=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>You are early, Taoist Xiang! Old Man He, go ahead and challenge him!
movie_5917_10=<font color="#ffff00">Xiang Jiuchen: </font>Please, let us begin.
movie_5917_11=<font color="#ffff00">Old Man He: </font>My son! I cannot avenge me. Let me join you in the afterlife!
movie_5917_12=<font color="#ffff00">Xiang Jiuchen: </font>No! I will not allow it!
movie_5917_13=<font color="#ffff00">Old Man He: </font>Hey!
movie_5917_14=<font color="#ffff00">Xiang Jiuchen: </font>Hmm?
movie_5917_15=<font color="#ffff00">Old Man He: </font>Xiang Jiuchen!
movie_5917_16=<font color="#ffff00">Xiang Jiuchen: </font>Elder Ye, I was defeated in the third round of our match. You may leave Wudang now as we've agreed.
movie_5917_17=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>Thank you for keeping your promise. I have some words for you before I leave.
movie_5917_18=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>The Ten Ultimates have reappeared. Chaos is upon us all. You should pay more attention to the here and now, rather than to dwell in the past.
movie_5917_19=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>Otherwise, you just may have even more to regret about later! Ha ha ha!
movie_5918_1=<font color="#ffff00">Wudang Disciple: </font>Look, the headmaster is dueling with Ye Jinglou!
movie_5918_2=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>Your swordsmanship is most impressive!
movie_5918_3=<font color="#ffff00">Immortal Ziyang: </font>I'd gladly exchange this skill for you to stay in Wudang for three more months.
movie_5918_4=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>Why? Why do you always try to hold me in Wudang?  Are you also coveting the Talisman of Life in my possession?
movie_5918_5=<font color="#FF00FF">Immortal Ziyang: </font>No, I'm not. However, if the Talisman of Life appears in Jianghu, many will surely lose their life for it.
movie_5918_6=<font color="#ffff00">Immortal Ziyang: </font>We cannot allow that. So I must keep you here for a little longer.
movie_5918_7=<font color="#ffff00">Ye Jinglou: </font>As you say. Since I am defeated, I will stay.
movie_5918_8=<font color="#FF00FF">Immortal Ziyang: </font>Excellent. Jiuchen, please arrange accommodations for Mr. Ye.
movie_5918_9=<font color="#ffff00">Xiang Jiuchen: </font>Of course.

movie_5963_1=Monk Dade, abbot of the Southern Shaolin, has arrived. The bell is ringing to summon all of us to welcome them at the hall.
movietalk_5961_1=For a Buddhist, all life is sacred. All have its karma.
movietalk_5961_2=Why train yourself to kill, when all life is sacred? The wisdom of martial arts is that it grounds you, here in the real, physical world.
movietalk_5961_3=This incense urn is but another manifestation of reality. To see it is to know that it is.
movietalk_5961_4=So, knock down this urn, and you will prove that it is real.
movietalk_5961_5=Amitabha!
movietalk_5961_6=To know the urn, see it in your eyes. Believe it in your mind. Know that it is there, it is real, and it is true.
movietalk_5961_7=But can you see the urn with your eyes, but not believe it in your mind?
movietalk_5961_8=The skills of northern Shaolin are unique and profound. Mastery requires a lifetime of cultivation.
movietalk_5961_9=My disciple Daosa sweeps and tends the fields most of the time. He only learns some basic skills in his spare time.
movietalk_5961_10=I want to challenge Northern Shaolin Dharma Hall Leader.

movietalk_5611_3=We lost the second one when he tried to kill the spy from the Royal Guards.
movietalk_5611_4=So the Royal Guards know about our plan?
movietalk_5611_5=Not yet. However, they know about the fake He jade.
movietalk_5611_6=Royal Guards have sent people to investigate. It's more difficult for us to take action now.
movietalk_5611_7=So, the Royal Guards are good at a thing or two, after all.
movietalk_5611_8=All right, it's time to show our trump card!
movietalk_5611_9=Take action according to this plan book. Failure is not allowed this time!

movietalk_5965_1=Leader, it's ready now, but…
movietalk_5965_2=The library is heavily guarded. Do we really have to do this?
movietalk_5965_3=Never mind. The southern Shaolin is a charlatan.
movietalk_5965_4=They're after Buddhist relics. When there's trouble, it will be our time to act.

movie_6501_13=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Peifeng:</font> The one thing that I do hate is the fact that you cannot always have what you want in life. We both already know that.
movie_6501_14=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Peifeng:</font> I won't blame you for hating me. Perhaps it's best if we never see each other again.
movie_6502_1=<font color="#ffff00">Jiman Banu:</font> Since the founding of the Heaven Net Cult, its followers have always been guided by the eternal holy flame. Now our members are legion throughout the Western Regions.

movie_6551_1=<font color="#ffff00">Lei Xingkong:</font> The Loulan Treasure will soon be mine. However, attaining the treasure is but a small part of my grand scheme.
movie_6551_2=<font color="#ffff00">Lei Xingkong:</font> It will be to our mutual advantage if you become my ally.
movie_6551_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Agreed. I will help you.
movie_6551_4=<font color="#ffff00">Master Qianzhuo:</font> The descendents of Loulan are willing to give you the treasure. In return, please promise them to revive their country.
movie_6551_5=<font color="#ffff00">Lei Xingkong:</font> Of course. But before I can even accept the treasure, we must prevent it from falling into the hands of the other factions.
movie_6551_6=<font color="#ffff00">Master Qianzhuo:</font> Thank you. The descendents of Luolan are in your debt! Buddha be praised!
movie_6551_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I am impressed that you are willing to help these people.
movie_6551_8=<font color="#ffff00">Lei Xingkong:</font> It's easier said than done. Before all this is over, those heroes already buried in desert will find more company.

movie_6601_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> You stood with your people to restore peace to your kingdom. For that, you have my respect.
movie_6601_3=<font color="#ffff00">Baisu Nizhi:</font> I had to defend our citizens against the ruthless ambition of my own brother, Bai Leba. It was the only choice I had.
movie_6602_1=<font color="#ffff00">Barbarian:</font> With the treasure map, we can preserve the legacy of our forefathers.
movie_6602_2=<font color="#ffff00">Mao Asi:</font> When these so-called heroes fight for the Luolan Treasure, they reveal their true nature. They're no better than bandits!
movie_6602_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Let the desert bury not only the treasure, but the greed of the many who seek it.
movie_6602_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> May this be a wake-up call for those with misguided ambitions.
movie_6603_1=<font color="#ffff00">Yuan Shiping:</font> You look like an honest person. I'll accept you as my disciple, and pass on my mantle to you.
movie_6603_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Thank you, Shifu. I'm honored.
movie_6603_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I don't expect to have the legendary Snowy Mountain Wanderer as my Shifu. Perhaps it's fate.

movie_9533_1=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Peifeng:</font> Hao Lianbi, you've hurt our Wudang disciples. You must pay for what you've done.

movie_9007_1=News of the Luolan's Treasure's appearance in the Western Regions has attracted heroes and villians from all over, pitting them against the local factions.
movie_9007_2=The martial artists who've come all the way from the Central Plains may be few in number, but each is a seasoned expert, cunning as well as strong.
movie_9007_3=Will the foreign raiders win their prize, or will the treasure remain as the legacy of the Western Regions? Perhaps it may even fall into your hands…
movie_9551_1=<font color="#ffff00">Hermit:</font> Western Regions is very dangerous now. You'd better make full preparation before setting forth.
movie_9551_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Thank you for your reminder. See you later!
movie_9542_1=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Chirui:</font> It must be Li Yanshuang!
movie_9542_2=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Chirui:</font> I've sealed the exit. I will kill her and avenge you.
movie_9542_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Where am I this time? I'll go ask someone over there.
movie_9542_4=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Chirui:</font> How dare you come to the Ancient Tomb! You must have something to do with Lu Wuming's death! Die!
movie_9543_1=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Chirui:</font> If death is what you're looking for, you've just found it.
movie_9543_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Stop! I've merely stumbled upon the this place. I have no idea what is going on!
movie_9544_1=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yanshuang:</font> Stop, or I will ignite the explosive!
movie_9544_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Let's all be calm…I mean you no harm. I just want to know the truth.
movie_9544_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Did you really kill Lu Wuming?
movie_9544_4=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yanshuang:</font> I can hardly believe myself for what I'm about to tell you. I was wielding my sword to intimidate Lu Wuming, but he then he took her sword and stabbed himself. I have nothing to do with his death.
movie_9544_5=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yanshuang:</font> Find Yang Chirui and ask her to open the door, or I'll blow up the ancient tomb!
movie_9545_1=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Chirui:</font> Go to the coffin. That leads to a secret path out of the tomb. I will ambush Li Yanshuang here.
movie_9545_2=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Chirui:</font> Is that the Ghost Mask?
movie_9546_1=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yanshuang:</font> Damn, the exit is sealed!
movie_9546_2=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yanshuang:</font> Who are you? Did Yang Chirui send you to kill me? Watch this!
movie_9547_1=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yanshuang:</font> You are looking for death!
movie_9547_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Stop! You misunderstood me! I came to the Ancient Tomb by accident and I have no idea what happened here!
movie_9548_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Li Yanshuang has set explosives in the Ancient Tomb. She will blow us up if you don't open the door.
movie_9548_2=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Chirui:</font> I don't believe you, villain! I should kill you right now!
movie_9548_3=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Chirui:</font> What did you do to me?
movie_9548_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Ha ha! I'm glad I still have these sedatives with me.
movie_9549_1=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yanshuang:</font> So here's the secret path! Go! I will take all the treasure with me while Yang Chirui is still sedated.
movie_9549_2=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yanshuang:</font> Wait, is that the Ghost Mask?
movie_9552_1=<font color="#ffff00">Bai Feifei:</font> Shi Guanyin, you're spared today only because you have an ally at your side. Next time we meet, I will surely kill you.
movie_9552_2=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Guanyin:</font> I can hardly wait.
movie_9552_3=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Guanyin:</font> Who's that? How dare you come to Stone Forest Cave!
movie_9552_4=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Guanyin:</font> It's the Heaven Net Cult…
movie_9552_5=<font color="#ffff00">Jiman Banu</font>: So you do know a thing or two, Shi Guanyin.
movie_9552_6=<font color="#ffff00">Jiman Banu</font>: Shi Guanyin, how dare you seduce my man? I am a hundred times prettier than you.
movie_9552_7=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Guanyin:</font> Do I have anything to do with that?
movie_9552_8=<font color="#ffff00">Jiman Banu:</font> Of course you do! You are going to die today!
movie_9553_1=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Guanyin:</font> Then why don't you kill me? I don't think you have what it takes.
movie_9553_2=<font color="#ffff00">Jiman Banu:</font> Kill you? You have so many enemies, I don't need to get my own hands dirty to have you dead.
movie_9553_3=<font color="#ffff00">Jiman Banu:</font> Let's go, sisters!
movie_9554_1=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Guanyin:</font> (Coughing)
movie_9554_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> You'd better get healed first.

movie_9554_7=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Guanyin:</font> It's you, Lei Xingkong.
movie_9554_8=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Guanyin:</font> Why are you here?
movie_9554_9=<font color="#ffff00">Lei Xingkong:</font> Shi Guanyin, give me the Loulan Treasure Map, or you'll forgive me if I no longer take our past into consideration.
movie_9554_10=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Guanyin:</font> Our past? Are you referring to Qianniang? Don't Pull our daughter into this.
movie_9554_11=<font color="#ffff00">Lei Xingkong:</font> Enough of this nonsense. Give me the map now, or I'll kill you!
movie_9554_12=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Guanyin:</font> Then kill me if you can. I won't let you take the Luolan Treasure!
movie_9554_13=<font color="#ffff00">Lei Xingkong:</font> I'm sorry it's come to this. Die, woman!
movie_9554_14=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Qianniang:</font> Stop!
movie_9554_15=<font color="#ffff00">Lei Xingkong, Shi Guanyin: </font>Qianniang, what are you doing here?
movie_9554_16=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Qianniang:</font> Whatever is going on here right now, that's none of my concern. I just have some questions for Lei Xingkong.
movie_9554_17=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Qianniang:</font> Stop, Lei Xingkong! Don't you run away from me!
movie_9554_18=<font color="#ffff00">Shi Guanyin:</font> Forget him. Men are just toys. What a woman really wants in this world are beauty, and power.
movie_9555_1=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Lingdang:</font> Behold, the frozen expanse that is the Northern Plains.
movie_9555_2=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Lingdang:</font> There are many rarely seen places Hidden in those mountains.
movie_9555_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Lingdang:</font> In this frigid wasteland, ancient alliances and feuds are frozen in time, preserved for ages.
movie_9555_4=<font color="#ffff00">Xiao Lingdang:</font> You will see the Northern Plains for yourself soon enough, so I won't elaborate further.
movie_9556_1=<font color="#ffff00">Mysterious Man:</font> It's very dangerous in Northern Plains now. You'd better make full preparation before venturing forth.
movie_9556_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Thank you for your reminder. See you later!
movie_9557_1=<font color="#ffff00">Gong Lanlan:</font> This is as far as we go. I have other things to do now. Goodbye!
movie_9557_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Farewell!
movie_9558_1=<font color="#ffff00">Shui Ji:</font> Stop! Don't you know that strangers cannot just enter the Divine Water Palace as they please? Why are you here?
movie_9580_1=<font color="#ffff00">Jiugong Elder:</font> Thanks to everyone's effort. Loulan Treasure will be conserved, with all sale proceeds to be donated locally to the poor. Our part in this business is now concluded.
movie_9580_2=<font color="#ffff00">Yang Peifeng:</font> We owe many thanks to this fine young hero for this day.
movie_9580_3=<font color="#ffff00">Jiugong Elder:</font> Indeed, you are a role model for us all.

movie_9580_7=<font color="#ffff00">Mu Dieyin:</font> How are you, my sister?
movie_9580_8=<font color="#ffff00">Xu Miaozhen:</font> It's been a while since I left the Emei, and I do appreciate still being recognized as a sister. Why isn't Sister Xuanyuan with you?
movie_9580_9=<font color="#ffff00">Yi Ruoxun:</font> We haven't seen Xuanyuan Chuqing since entering the treasury. I hope nothing has happened to her.
movie_9580_10=<font color="#ffff00">Xuanyuan Chuqing:</font> As a descendent of Loulan, I had the duty to protect the Loulan Treasure, but I did not do so.
movie_9580_11=<font color="#ffff00">Xuanyuan Chuqing:</font> Am I betraying my heritage, even by giving our legacy to a righteous school like the Emei?
movie_9581_1=<font color="#ffff00">Demon Blade Elder:</font> I am here to save you. Come with me. This place is about to collapse.
movie_9581_2=In the middle of the desert, you and Demon Blade Elder are looking at the collapsed cavern that was once the Loulan Treasury.
movie_9581_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Damn! We were so close.
movie_9581_4=<font color="#ffff00">Demon Blade Elder:</font> The cavern just collasped all the sudden, after all these years. It had to be sabotage.
movie_9581_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> Those who talk all day about virtue and righteousness are so vicious. They destroy anything they cannot possess.
movie_9581_6=<font color="#ffff00">Demon Blade Elder:</font> I've seen it all before. Being virtuous and righteous will not keep you alive. If you want to survive, you must be strong.
movie_9581_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font> What should we do now, with the treasure no longer within our reach?
movie_9581_8=<font color="#ffff00">Demon Blade Elder:</font> A true hero should pursue power instead of material wealth. Power is the true currency of this world.
movie_9581_9=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> You are right, but…
movie_9581_10=<font color="#ffff00">Demon Blade Elder:</font> Don't think too much about it. As of today, you are worthy to be my disciple. What do you say?
movie_9581_11=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font> I am most honored, shifu.
movie_9600_1=<font color="#ffff00">Pervert: </font>This puppet is perfect.

movie_9604_1=<font color="#ffff00">Shui Ji:</font> Lord Qin is not to be trifled with. Since you have yet to find Tian Xi, and have no solid evidence, you will not win the trust of Changfeng Escort Agency so easily. I wish you the best of luck!

movie_9701_3=<font color="#ffff00">Water Chestnut Immortal: </font>Not yet. I was attacked by a person dressed in black. I have two Emei disciples to thank for saving me.
movie_9701_4=<font color="#ffff00">Matriarch Yinji: </font>We owe another debt to our Emei sisters. We will repay them in kind to strengthen our solidarity.
movie_9701_5=<font color="#ffff00">Disciples: </font>We understand.

movie_6691_2=<font color="#ffff00">Man in green: </font>Do you seriously think I'd be one of your traitor scum?
movie_6691_3=<font color="#ffff00">Middle-aged man: </font>I extended the courtesy because we both came from the same school. If you insist on being my enemy, then you leave me with no choice.
movie_6691_4=<font color="#ffff00">Man in green: </font>Enough talk. Let's get this over with.
movie_6691_5=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>So many against one? I cannot let this happen!

movie_6692_1=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>So this is the hero you mentioned?
movie_6692_2=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Ruoyi: </font>Yes, father.
movie_6692_3=<font color="#ffff00">Wind Shadow: </font>You have passed the Trial of the Seven Swords. As of today, you are a Mount Hua Sect disciple. Go greet the headmaster.
movie_6692_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Hold on…I am here only to deliver a message. I didn't ask to be tested or to join your faction!
movie_6692_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Ruoyi: </font>You did not carry a letter. We couldn't trust you by your spoken words alone.
movie_6692_6=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Ruoyi: </font>Now that we are fellow disciples, we can start to trust you.
movie_6692_7=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>If I want to join you, I will come to you for that reason. You do not have to trick me.
movie_6692_8=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>Very well, I understand.
movie_6692_9=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>My daughter is young and mischievous. Please forgive her.
movie_6692_10=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>It's all right. I am honored, actually.
movie_6692_11=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>Then let us discuss your true reason for coming to us.
movie_6692_12=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>I'm sorry to hear that the Chi Clan have turned to the evil cult. Thank you for letting me know.
movie_6692_13=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>It's nothing. I was only forwarding a message.
movie_6692_14=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>You did pass our trials. You are qualified to join our faction.
movie_6692_15=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>Stay here at Mount Hua as our guest for a few days, and think it over. If you do decide to join us, then go see Zhang Tianyi.

movie_6694_1=<font color="#ffff00">???: </font>We are making good progress with our mission. Both the Cult Leader and Delta are pleased.
movie_6694_2=<font color="#ffff00">???: </font>We will proceed as planned tonight, and capture Wind Shadow.
movie_6694_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}:</font>Huh?
movie_6694_4=<font color="#ffff00">Emei disciple: </font>What about the people following her?

movie_6694_10=<font color="#ffff00">Emei disciple: </font>What's this? Mad Emperor's Sword?!?
movie_6694_11=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Lonely Elder!
movie_6695_1=<font color="#ffff00">Mad Emperor: </font>Leave.
movie_6695_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>I don't have to listen to you. Since you betrayed our school, you are no longer my elder.
movie_6695_3=<font color="#ffff00">Mad Emperor: </font>Whatever you say.
movie_6695_4=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Don’t you get away from me!
movie_6695_5=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>What happened? Where's Wind Shadow?
movie_6695_6=<font color="#ffff00">Mad Emperor: </font>See for yourself.
movie_6695_7=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>It says, meet at the eastern woods at midnight. If Wind Shadow is still alive, you can trade her with the Mad Emperor's Sword.
movie_6696_1=<font color="#ffff00">Mad Emperor: </font>I'm here.
movie_6696_2=<font color="#ffff00">Delta: </font>Where are the others?

movie_6696_4=<font color="#ffff00">Delta: </font>Very well. Place your sword here.
movie_6696_5=<font color="#ffff00">Delta: </font>Then back off, slowly.
movie_6696_6=<font color="#ffff00">Delta: </font>Go.
movie_6696_7=<font color="#ffff00">Man in black: </font>I can't lift the sword!

movie_6696_10=<font color="#ffff00">Delta: </font>Ha ha ha!
movie_6696_11=<font color="#ffff00">Mad Emperor: </font>Is this…poison?
movie_6696_12=<font color="#ffff00">Delta: </font>Indeed, it is a most insidious poison. Upon ingestion, it remains inert and undetectable, until it suddenly unleashes its deadly effect.
movie_6696_13=<font color="#ffff00">Delta: </font>Without the antidote, you will die in a day.
movie_6696_14=<font color="#ffff00">Delta: </font>I am impressed that you have lasted this long. But the final victory is already mine! Ha ha!
movie_6698_1=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yunhe: </font>Headmaster! I need to see you!
movie_6698_2=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>What is it?
movie_6698_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>You're an adult now, so act like one! Stop playing silly games with my daughter.
movie_6698_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>As the wielder of the Loveless Sword, you must set yourself as a good example.
movie_6698_5=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yunhe: </font>I just want know one thing…is "Eagle Eyes" Li Tuchuan my real father?
movie_6698_6=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>So, you've finally learned the truth.
movie_6698_7=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>It's been twenty-five years. I owe your parents a great debt, one which I can never repay.
movie_6698_8=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yunhe: </font>So it's true! Bai the Sage speaks the truth!
movie_6698_9=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yunhe: </font>You…you are responsible for my parents' deaths!
movie_6698_10=<font color="#ffff00">Bai the Sage: </font>Please calm down, Brother Li!
movie_6698_11=<font color="#ffff00">Bai the Sage: </font>I have more information regarding your father. The headmaster is not at fault!
movie_6698_12=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yunhe: </font>What are you saying?
movie_6698_13=<font color="#ffff00">Bai the Sage: </font>That year, Li Tuchuan came to Mount Hua with his wife and their infant son.
movie_6698_14=<font color="#ffff00">Bai the Sage: </font>Your father was desperate to heal the headmaster's wife, Zhao Suliu. He went to Shennong Valley to find a medicinal herb, but had ingested fatal poison instead.
movie_6698_15=<font color="#ffff00">Bai the Sage: </font>His wife left Mount Hua in grief, and died soon thereafter.
movie_6698_16=<font color="#ffff00">Bai the Sage: </font>Headmaster Zhao mourned for his wife, and felt great remorse for your parents. Thus he made every effort to find their child.
movie_6698_17=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>There is a character for "kite" sewn into your shoes. It is proof that you are Li Tuchauan's son, for that is his mark.
movie_6698_18=<font color="#ffff00">Bai the Sage: </font>So you see, the headmaster not only accepted responsibility for your parents' deaths, he also raised you for the past twenty-five years!
movie_6698_19=<font color="#ffff00">Li Yunhe: </font>I…I don't know what to say…
movie_6698_20=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>You are my adopted son and my heir, Yunhe. That will never change.
movie_6699_1=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>It's the cult! We've been ambushed!
movie_6699_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>It's a trap, Brother Zhuge! The cultists are waiting for us just outside the woods!

movie_6700_2=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Yun: </font>What is this?
movie_6700_3=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>It's a hairpin.
movie_6700_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Yun: </font>That belongs to Xiaolan!
movie_6700_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Yun: </font>Follow me, everyone! Watch your step!
movie_6700_6=<font color="#ffff00">Cultist: </font>They're just ahead of us! After them!
movie_6700_7=(an eerie sound)
movie_6700_8=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Yun: </font>Watch out!
movie_6700_9=<font color="#ffff00">Cultist: </font>Ha ha…
movie_6700_10=<font color="#ffff00">Zhuge Yun: </font>Let this be your worst nightmare…

movie_6701_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>The Celestial Spearhead…where did you get it?
movie_6701_6=<font color="#ffff00">Eye in the Sky: </font>So, you're Zhou Buyi's son.
movie_6701_7=<font color="#ffff00">Eye in the Sky: </font>You look just like your father. Don't get yourself involved, or you'll end up just like him!
movie_6701_8=<font color="#ffff00">Eye in the Sky: </font>Your father gave his life to save you. Don't make the same mistake hid did.
movie_6701_9=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao: </font>Spare me your nonsense.

movie_6702_4=<font color="#ffff00">???: </font>Hehe, aren't you looking for me all this time?
movie_6702_5=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuqing: </font>You must be Leng Qianjue, of the Silent Temple.
movie_6702_6=<font color="#ffff00">Leng Qianjue: </font>At your service. I know you're looking for me, to get an antidote.
movie_6702_7=<font color="#ffff00">Leng Qianjue: </font>I can let you have it, if you will do one small thing for me.
movie_6702_8=<font color="#ffff00">Leng Qianjue: </font>You must come with me to a special place.
movie_6702_9=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>It's Leng Qianjue! I better let Xing Junke know.
movie_6702_10=<font color="#ffff00">Mo Wuqing: </font>Where are we going?
movie_6702_11=<font color="#ffff00">Leng Qianjue: </font>Cold Moon Manor…ever heard of it?

movie_2000_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zhou Yixiao:</font> It can't be as simple as a mere contest of martial arts. These Eastern Seas factions are stronger than ever.
movie_2000_5=<font color="#FFFF00">Xi Chi:</font> As they have grown in strength, so have we. We will defeat them, just as we did twenty years ago.

movie_52_122=<font color="#ffff00">Heroes: </font>I don't think so. Peacock Villa can exist for hundreds of years must have its own way of living. We'd better be careful. Don't capsize the boat in the sewer and leave your life here.

movie_71_10=<font color="#f790ce">Madam Qiu: </font>Husband, you have also seen that the little Peacock Plume has brought us many trouble in the last decades. We may have been separated between death and life without those chivalrous people.

movie_9887_2=<font color="#ffff00">Li Wu: </font>So what? The Tartar gave me gold and jewels, beauties and meat. I’ve never been happier, hahaha!
movie_9887_3=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Hmpf! Let me ask you one thing. Do you know where Lord Zhu is?

movie_9887_5=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Seems like I won’t find out anything about the Lord... But this traitor is insufferable!
movie_9888_1=<font color="#ffff00">Wanderer: </font>Is it... Is it possible that the Tartar are planning to use these kites for a surprise attack on Yanmen Pass?
movie_9888_2=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>No wonder that madman is such a capable fighter. Must be a Tartar Army General. Got to stand guard to stay alive.
movie_9888_3=<font color="#ffff00">Wanderer: </font>Hm, in this case we will do unto them as they do unto us.
movie_9888_4=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Right. We will destroy the most of these kites and ride the remaining ones to sabotage Tartar provisions!

movie_9889_2=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>We should not stay here for long. Let’s get to Yanmen Pass.
movie_9891_1=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>The situation is complicated. Hall Leader Ma Bian personally guards the Peacock villa main gate. Seems like they’ve made drastic changes. I think we should recruit more allies.
movie_9891_2=<font color="#ffff00">Group of heroes: </font>You're right. That terrifying place is indeed the famous Peacock Villa!
movie_9891_3=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Let’s get going.
movie_9892_1=<font color="#ffff00">Wulin Man: </font>Many of those who tried to infiltrate the villa, got trapped in the Five Elements Array. We need to rescue them. That array is the key to villa.

movie_9895_2=<font color="#f790ce">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Don’t be like that. Phantoms' Mountain Manor is not Wulin’s righteous faction. We also have seen through Phoenix Feather selfish motives.
movie_9895_3=<font color="#ffff00">Gao Li: </font>I can’t do much against the whole Phantoms' Mountain Manor on my own. Help me rescue my brother Qiu Fengwu! He will not hand over the Phoenix Feather so easily. There still must be someone alive!

movie_9895_5=<font color="#ffff00">Gao Li: </font>There is a cave that leads into Peacock Villa. It goes to a Four Symbols Array. I don’t know the whole picture, but once Ma Feng died, the array’s entrance was revealed.

movie_9904_1=<font color="#ffff00">Li Zhong: </font>Good that you came here. You don’t look like the islanders. I am Li Zhong, leader of the rebellion. You came here to eliminate the Hell King, I presume.
movie_9904_2=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>I have no idea who is that, but he seems to know the island well. Let’s see what he is first.
movie_9904_3=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>I don’t know what grudges you have with him. Why should I trust you?
movie_9904_4=<font color="#ffff00">Li Zhong: </font>...To tell the truth, all of us who went against Hell King’s people were threatened by him and controlled by a ledger. We can no longer tolerate his oppression. Now that the island is under pirate attack, it's our chance to act.
movie_9904_5=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>I see. I also have my grievances against the Hell King. But I heard this person is mysterious and his whereabouts are uncertain. Can you help me find him?
movie_9904_6=<font color="#ffff00">Li Zhong: </font>I don’t know where Hell King is, but I know where to find his minions.

movie_9905_2=<font color="#ffff00">Haneshiba Kinomasa: </font>Damn! That guy from the outside. Can I really believe this Li? He told me there is much treasure on this island. I've brought many men to take it. Humph! Easier to chop them up altogether!
movie_9905_3=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Li? Could it be... Hmpf! These Japanese pirates still won’t die!
movie_9874_1=<font color="#ffff00">Jin Huaiyu: </font>Let me tell you about the inn’s situation.
movie_9874_2=<font color="#ffff00">Jin Huaiyu: </font>Go straight. On the left is the inn's kitchen. The head chef is Lai Shun.
movie_9874_3=<font color="#ffff00">Jin Huaiyu: </font>On the right is the material room. There you'll find meat stuffing, wine and so on.
movie_9874_4=<font color="#ffff00">Jin Huaiyu: </font>Take a look again. Here is the backyard of the inn. Most of the guests' carriages and goods are stored here. On the right side there are vegetable fields. They have potatoes and other tubers.
movie_9874_5=<font color="#ffff00">Jin Huaiyu: </font>These are the second floor guest rooms up here. Be careful that most of the guests don't like to be disturbed. If anyone annoys the guests, don't blame me not saving your face.
movie_9874_6=<font color="#ffff00">Jin Huaiyu: </font>Here is the front door of the inn. Exit the inn and turn right. The Longmen Pass is not far from here. If you turn left, you'll see Zhuo Town. As for Helan Mount, you'd better not go. Horrible brigands kill all the rich men who pass by there. If they weren't there we might actually be able to get a lot of business.
movie_9874_7=<font color="#ffff00">Jin Huaiyu: </font>Oh and one more thing. If you want to travel far away go by carriage. The carter Old Cheng is usually outside. That old duffer charges a lot, but if you don't want to get lost in the desert, he's your best bet.
movie_9907_1=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Hey, who's sneaking around over there?
movie_9908_1=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>The men in black! Let me follow them and see.
movie_9908_2=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Hmpf! Their camp is hidden here.
movie_9909_1=<font color="#ffff00">Du Zhimin: </font>A howling arrow was fired near the valley. There may be changes. Go and check it out. I will stay here to clean up the battlefield.
movie_9909_2=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Yes!
movie_9910_1=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Camp Master!
movie_9910_2=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>The subordinates are Jianghu people after all. Although they benefited a lot from Shenji Camp, there are many grievances that can’t be set aside. The outer enemy has retreated. I am asking you for a permission to leave.
movie_9910_3=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Shaojun: </font>Well...
movie_9910_4=<font color="#ffff00">Lu Shaojun: </font>As a Ming Dynasty citizen, you must take your home as a priority no matter where you are, cannot collude with outsiders in your personal interest and breed chaos, thus damaging the Shenji Camp reputation. Now go!

movie_9911_1=<font color="#ffff00">Commoner: </font>Oh, it is you, Lord Qin! Excuse me for slighting you.
movie_9911_2=<font color="#ffff00">Commoner: </font>Hmpf! To guard some stranger! What a scum!
movie_9914_1=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Oh? Who are you? What are you doing here?
movie_9915_1=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Someone snuck into the island, and that startled the Tianwaitian people.
movie_9915_2=<font color="#ffff00">Tianwaitian Sect Guard: </font>The Imperial Court also became suspicious of Tianwaitian Sect, and has sent someone to spy.
movie_9915_3=<font color="#ffff00">Tianwaitian Sect Guard: </font>It is a pity they’ve underestimated Tianwaitian Sect. That lowlife that they have sent to spy was hit with Mandala Flower Poison and didn’t hear a word. Now he is in the Tianwaitian’s prison.
movie_9918_1=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Strange... How come there is not even a single clue.
movie_9918_2=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Huh? Someone’s watching me.
movie_9921_1=<font color="#ffff00">Xuanyuan Chuqing: </font>Are you... One of the Royal Guards?
movie_9921_2=<font color="#ffff00">Mysterious Man: </font>It's not important who I am. What's important is my purpose.
movie_9921_3=<font color="#ffff00">Xuanyuan Chuqing: </font>I don't know what you are saying. There are many martial art experts in Emei. I advise you to leave as soon as possible.
movie_9921_4=<font color="#ffff00">Mysterious Man: </font>Hm... That title of Emei does not scare me.
movie_9921_5=<font color="#ffff00">Mysterious Man: </font>No need to hide it anymore. Your brother Xuanyuan Kuanglang is truly shrewd, but does he really think he can hide among Royal Guard lords?
movie_9921_6=<font color="#ffff00">Mysterious Man: </font>He will be granted a red banner seat if only he is seen as useful. Should you refuse to cooperate, no one will be able to protect him from a strike from above when the time comes!
movie_9921_7=<font color="#ffff00">Xuanyuan Chuqing: </font>You...
movie_9921_8=<font color="#ffff00">Mysterious Man: </font>Who is lurking there? Show yourself!
movie_9935_1=<font color="#ffff00"></font>According to a legend, eight hundred miles into Qinling valley, in a deserted place, lies a hidden ancient pre-Qin tomb.
movie_9935_2=<font color="#ffff00"></font>Once the Silent Temple took over that place, they’ve gathered craftsmen from all over the world to transform this tomb into a grand underground palace, but afterwards abandoned it for a reason unknown.
movie_9935_3=<font color="#ffff00"></font>Although Qinling mountain range is boundless and Silent Temple’s methods are mysterious to the extreme, Jianghu people’s opinions on this matter were divided. Still, no one has ever been able to find the underground palace’s entrance.

movie_9940_2=<font color="#ffff00">Gong Shuxuan: </font>You are not bad too. Tell me your name first.
movie_9940_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Yi: </font>I am Zhu Yi.
movie_9940_4=<font color="#ffff00">Gong Shuxuan: </font>That guy actually sent his clansman to die?
movie_9940_5=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Yi: </font>Huh?
movie_9940_6=<font color="#ffff00">Gong Shuxuan: </font>I barely stand on my feet. Is something wrong with the mechanism? Ha ha, seems like you are not destined to die!
movie_9940_7=<font color="#ffff00">Gong Shuxuan: </font>Still I have some connections with Zhu clan. Since you came here, you might as well stay with me.
movie_9940_8=<font color="#ffff00">Gong Shuxuan: </font>The battle of deception raging on outside is way more arduous. Though you had a great luck, one day you will die, which is no better than my fate.
movie_9940_9=<font color="#ffff00">Gong Shuxuan: </font>He he he...
movie_9937_1=<font color="#ffff00">Wu Yin: </font>So there are others aside from the blind man who know about this place... How could those little thieves divide grandpa’s treasure!
movie_9938_1=<font color="#ffff00">Cui Ji: </font>Who are you? Why are you here?
movie_9938_2=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Yi: </font>I am Zhu Yi. I’ve took some people here to investigate at the behest of Lord Qin. You are...
movie_9938_3=<font color="#ffff00">Cui Ji: </font>Oh? So Lord Qin sent his people here? Die now!
movie_9937_2=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Yi: </font>He is...
movie_9937_3=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Who's that?
movie_9937_4=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Yi: </font>Careful! This is the notoriously merciless bandit Wu Yin!
movie_9941_1=<font color="#ffff00">{@IDName:Player}: </font>Who are these people?... What a fierce killing move!
movie_9941_2=<font color="#ffff00">Subordinate: </font>Why not... make a clean kill. Kill this one altogether!
movie_9941_3=<font color="#ffff00">Cui Ji: </font>He is just a pawn that has nothing to do with the Silent Temple or Lord Qin Manor. I don’t want to have a reputation for killing the innocent. This is unnecessary!
movie_9941_4=<font color="#ffff00">Cui Ji: </font>Too bad! Assassins are here. Withdraw!
movie_9945_1=<font color="#ffff00">Gong Shuxuan: </font>Seems like this blind swordsman Cui Ji won’t be able to take revenge.
movie_9945_2=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Yi: </font>Who are you? Is there really a Silent Temple altar in here?
movie_9945_3=<font color="#ffff00">Gong Shuxuan: </font>So many years have passed... Silent Temple must have long forgotten Gong Shuxuan.
movie_9945_4=<font color="#ffff00">Gong Shuxuan: </font>The Silent Temple has prepared nothing more but a tomb for Jianghu people. This is my final settling place, and everyone else will be buried with me.
movie_9947_1=<font color="#ffff00">Li Qingkuang: </font>Hmpf! Killing one hundred in sake of one! Isn’t that a defeat?
movie_9947_2=<font color="#ffff00">Commoner: </font>Li Qingkuang!
movie_9947_3=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Yi: </font>Silent Temple Assassin! How did you know of this place? Have you been following us?
movie_9947_4=<font color="#ffff00">Li Qingkuang: </font>You’ve recognized me? You won’t have to know how I got here since you won’t be leaving this place!
movie_9948_1=<font color="#ffff00">Zhu Yi: </font>Subordinates, pay respects to Lord Qin!
movie_9948_2=<font color="#ffff00">Gong Shuxuan: </font>Haha, your mastery of disguise has been brought to the point of perfection. Only now I see that you have disguised yourself.
movie_9948_3=<font color="#ffff00">Fake Lord Qin: </font>Hmpf! Deal with this lad first. The Dragon Seal must be in his hands.
movie_9948_4=<font color="#ffff00">Gong Shuxuan: </font>Hahaha, the Dragon Seal is really here. Now I bid you farewell!
movie_9948_5=<font color="#ffff00">Fake Lord Qin: </font>Stop! Leave the Dragon Seal!
movie_52_123=<font color="#ffff00">Heroes: </font>Don't say it in this way. Heroes, let's cooperate to break through this round first to express our cooperating intention!
movie_72_6=<font color="#ff0000">Taoist Mu: </font>If Madam had the real Peacock Plume, why hasn't she used it on me yet?
movie_72_8=<font color="#f790ce">Madam Qiu: </font>The Taoist is really meticulous. The real Peacock Plume hasn't existed for over a hundred years. The imitations are made from blueprints, so it doesn't matter where the real one is.
