He is the head of the Four Great Outlaws and roamed the 13 provinces of the north, south, east, and west. He was ranked number nine of 10 on the most wanted list. His martial arts were peerless.

Nothing was heard from him for many years, but now his past has caught up with him. What were Ding Jiuzhong's crimes? This is not connected with his martial skills, nor does it have to do with the attempt to suppress him. It has to do with the Cultist treasure.
