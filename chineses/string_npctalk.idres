task_funnpcclone004088=They say the Manchus have already conquered Dongfang Village. It's only a few dozen miles away from here. I'm afraid this place will be next, so I'm preparing to flee.

task_funnpcclone004060_2=We have burnt all the antidote medicine so that Mongols can't use it. You can get some torches near the fire to keep the vipers away from you.
task_funnpcclone004552=Defend our territory! Drive out the Tartars!
task_funnpcclone004551=Please, save the people of Dongquan Village!

task_bossclone009002_11=You doubt me? Why not go ask her? Ask her, why she killed Liu Ruofei? Why did she grab Lin Xiaofu's daughter and leave her to be raised by a peasant? Why didn't she take care of Sifei even if she knew who Sifei was?
task_bossclone009002_12=I hide in the mountain and wait to take vengeance on Abbess Mieyuan. But when I see Sifei, I am filled with pity and forget everything. I only hope she can live a happy life.

task_funnpcclone009038_1=Unfortunately, my knowledge is limited. Back then I was a young girl who went to Mount Emei with Older Martial Sister Lin Xiaofu.

Lin Xiaofu became close to him. During that time, Emei was preparing to fight against the Cult when Xiaofu became pregnant. Lin Ruofei was willing to give up his position in the Cult and run away with Xiaofu, but our Leader wouldn't allow it. They were tried. I followed them and watched helplessly as Sister was in great physical pain from her pregnancy. Master Liu wanted to get close to her just so he could steal the Heaven-Reliant Sword, and I ...I think I am not worthy.

task_funnpcclone009033_3=No need. I have already been defeated. One generation dies, another takes its place. But there is still more to do if you want to descend the mountain.
task_funnpcclone009033_4=Do you know why it is called Sacrifice Cliff? Do you know why fewer and fewer people have been visiting the mountain in the past hundred years?
task_funnpcclone009033_5=Because, the final challenge is to leap from Sacrifice Cliff!

You need to break the array first before dealing with her. Take care! But before this, there were many Emei Disciples on the road. If you want to save your energy on this part of the journey, go directly to Zhao Yuchun and ask to ride a horse. Then, talk with me.
task_funnpcclone009122_2=The road ahead is difficult. I wish you the best of luck!
task_funnpcclone009122a=Now, you must go to Meiyan Nunnery and seek Mistress Jueyou. Remember, you must defeat her in order to continue onward. Mistress Jueyou will be in Meiyan Tower. It is very well-defended. After you defeat Mistress Jueyou, I will give you the next hint. If you want to save your energy on the journey to Meiyan Nunnery, get on the horse while talking with me.
task_funnpcclone009122a_1=The road ahead is difficult. I wish you the best of luck!
task_funnpcclone009122b=The road ahead is even more difficult. You must defeat Mistress Jueyou in the Library Pavilion and Su Yangxue at Breath-Stopping Lake. You can only continue to search for treasure if you can defeat them. When you are ready, get on the horse and look for me. I can help you save your energy.
task_funnpcclone009122b_1=The road ahead is difficult. I wish you the best of luck!
task_funnpcclone009122c=Hey!
task_funnpcclone009122d=This way leads to the entrance to the final level: Sacrifice Cliff. There is no way back. You must defeat Mistress Jueyou to go any further. On my left there is a mountain road that leads to Muyun Peak. Whether or not you can get this treasure all depends on your skill!

task_funnpcclone017027=Perhaps you could find a clue if you go to Hunter's Cabin.
task_funnpcclone017028=I saw Hall Leader Shen leading many people along this road.
task_funnpcclone017029=Hunter's Cabin is not far from here. But if you get lost, you might end up on the Ant Path. I heard it is very dangerous.
task_funnpcclone017031=Do you work for the Royal Guards, too? Shen Hao may be somewhere up ahead.
task_funnpcclone017033=You interrupted me, and now I have forgotten what number I counted to.

task_funnpcclone017045=After word of the silk brocade got out, everyone on the road started venturing to the eight schools to try to obtain it. It looks like that is why you have come here, too.
task_funnpcclone017046=The Black Wind Mountain Cave was difficult to attack, so everyone chose to attack by water. Some people came here before us. You will not be the last to come here, either.
task_funnpcclone017043=The night is upon us. We have decided to rest here.
task_funnpcclone017048=The Royal Guards are well prepared. Let someone in front try to sap their strength. If we join together, maybe we could flank them from the rear.
task_funnpcclone017047=If you have the determination, then take action. You can catch up to the ones who came before you. Maybe you could even join up with them.
task_funnpcclone017050=We have seen battle all along the road. We do not want to meet up with a leader of the Royal Guards too soon. After being defeated, we had no choice but to withdraw. We need to lick our wounds and build up our strength again.
task_funnpcclone017049=I have heard there is a fortress of the Royal Guards up ahead called "Ten Kings Palace" that no one has ever invaded. But many friends in Jianghu have been captured and taken there.

task_funnpcclone017071=Thank you, young heroes, for your help. I hope that the pills I have will help you get the silk brocade.

task_funnpcclone017063=Some little spirits have a few tricks up their sleeves to get through the Spirit Gate. Young heroes, we might as well join forces to break through the Spirit Gate.
task_funnpcclone017061=A good dog should never get in the way of its master. These finicky dogs are really getting on my nerves.
task_funnpcclone017064=Harumph! Those two out in front are really something. I won't let you enter the Ten Kings Palace unless you can handle them.
task_funnpcclone017065=Young heroes, if you can save me, I will definitely make it worth your while.

task_funnpcclone017068=This jail is like the ninth circle of hell. Hurry up and rescue me!
task_funnpcclone017073=I was barely able to make it here. If it weren't for my Flying Skill I learned in Emei, I would have never made it.
task_funnpcclone017074=To tell the truth, Dong Dapeng is really no match for me in terms of just martial arts skill alone.
task_funnpcclone017075=This place is damp and gloomy and reeks with the stench of death. I have dealt with poison all my life, but even I cannot stand this decrepit place.
task_funnpcclone017076=I was separated from my friend from Wudang territory.
task_funnpcclone017077=Ha ha. Ahem... Has anyone else been locked in there by that eunuch?

task_funnpcclone017081=I never thought this simple matter would incite such an overheated response. This is uncalled for. Let me and my brothers and sisters go.
task_FunnpcClone017086=The situation seems to be different than how we originally saw it. We found that this factory owner is probably just a puppet, and the real factory owner is planning something behind the scenes. We will continue to watch the situation. You can go back and report to the commander.
task_FunnpcClone017087=Maybe you are unaware, but there are many unknown cells in The Purgatory. Perhaps Yue Zhipeng and Shen Hao are in one of these cells. We will continue to investigate.
task_FunnpcClone017088=Damn it. These bastards thought they could fool the Royal Guards with masks! I guess they never figured they would outwit themselves. We will make the East Chamber pay for this.
task_FunnpcClone017089=I think Commander Huangfu will definitely see it differently. When there is a new situation, then maybe we can work together again.

task_wwwqnpc_event_007_2=...I still think repaying you in my next life is more sincere...help!
task_Boss_Wwwq_event_008_1=Huh, a man changes enough in three days. It's been three years since we've seen each other. I am not the old me anymore. Elder Brother, you're the one who underestimated your enemy and that's why you're in this predictament. You only have yourself to blame.

task_wwwqnpc_event_009_2=Tsk. And to think I wasted 200 qian on a set of old clothes. I planned to send you down quickly so you can reincarnate quickly, now my plan is ruined. To tell you the truth, it was your son who wanted you out of the way. You're 70 going onto 80 but you're still holding onto all the ancestral estates and all your wives; how much use do you have for all of them? Don't worry, your son will be taking care of things after you're gone. Your girls will be still enjoying themselves, and I'll be sharing a piece of the pie too, haha!
task_Boss_Wwwq_event_010_1=You and I have both been poisoned by the Love Flower Poison and this is the only antidote. Brother, you don't need to say anything! Take the antidote! Take care of Feifei of Yihong Courtyard! Ah, I was a fool. Only someone as talented and handsome as you could be a match for her, so why should I keep pursuing her? The only thing that's come of it is two brothers fighting it out and end up getting poisoned by the Love Flower Poison and getting mocked...
task_wwwqnpc_event_010_1=...(shedding tears quietly)
task_Boss_Wwwq_event_010_2=Why aren't you talking? Ah, I forgot I just stabbed you in the back and sealed your mouth shut. No wonder you can't talk. I appreciate your gratitude, brother. Go in peace, I'll be sure to take care of Feifei for you!

task_wwwqnpc_event_011_1=...I, I...please, please...help, help me...
task_Boss_Wwwq_event_011_2=And well, that's what happened. He seems to be trying to recommend something to me. Tell me what I should do, Guanyin Bodhisattva, Buddha and Sakyamuni! Uh-huh? You refuse? I understand. What if he doesn't agree? Tiles? Great!

It was Guo, he acted against his conscience and, and stole, stole it from me. You, you stupid and ignorant fools, you didn't stop to think...
task_wwwqnpc_event_013_2=Do, do you think I, I would believe this nonsense? Master Guo, is, is a great hero and you, you're just a beggar. Why should I, I believe you? Not, not to mention, I have more, more to gain following Great Hero Guo. What, what can you do for me? After, after talking all this nonsense, you're not tired, but I, I'm tired. Die, die...
