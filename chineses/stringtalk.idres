talk_free_29520=Yes, we will always remember Mr. Han's kindness.
talk_free_29521=Zho Ziji deserves more than death. Our Han family is so big that he can never escape from us.
talk_free_29523=I want to find out where he ran off to. Those rotten fiends won't get away that easy...
talk_free_29524=I have been waiting so long. Finally… finally…
talk_free_29525=Yup. After I kill that rotten Zhao Ziji, Old Han will rest in peace.

talk_free_29911=I have something to tell you.
talk_free_35501=Don't know where my poor disciple is?
talk_free_35502=That's because I was too stubborn. This is my punishment, I guess.
talk_free_35503=Ruo Fei, it was my master who didn't let me see you. I should have listened to you.
talk_free_35505=Let's practice kung fu.
talk_free_35506=I'm troubled these days, what with all the villagers disappearing.
talk_free_35510=Juechen, Jueming. After I learn divine kung fu skills I will use them to bring chaos to Emei.
talk_free_35514=Blast! There's not so much as even a sparrow in all of Emei. No one comes here in the mid-afternoon.

talk_free_45034=When I'm healed, I'll kill all those government minions.
talk_free_45035=I am in the Shura King's debt, sp how can I shrink back in times of danger? No, I need to heal up quickly so I can rescue him.
talk_free_45036=The entrance to Cavern of Lost Souls is surrounded by government soldiers. This isn't looking good you know!

talk_free_30502=One person stand guard so no one can attack.
talk_free_30503=The day we take over the central plains approaches!
talk_free_30504=I need a true battle!
talk_free_30505=The Ming Dynasty is within my grasp, why would I care about Yanmen Pass!
talk_free_48001=Who doesn't know about the Five Elements Flag?
talk_free_48002=I have always been a resolute person. Now, all I care about is the Green Cloud Castle!
talk_free_48003=My business is my business. Leave me alone.
talk_free_48004=The Castle Lord is wise and brave.
talk_free_48005=The helpers that Castle Lord invited haven't come yet. Why is this?
talk_free_48006=I always feel scared when things play out similar to the scene at Qing Ming Festival.
talk_free_48007=Butterflies, come here, come here!
talk_free_48008=Those idiots thought you killed those people.
talk_free_48009=After complete my life's work, I'll come be with you everyday.
talk_free_48010=Where did Shen Qingyun hide her stuff?
talk_free_48011=At Fire-Cloud Villa, we always get what we want.
talk_free_48012=I never thought something like this would happen in Green Cloud Castle.
talk_free_48013=It's strange that first brother hasn't appeared. Could that be him?
talk_free_48014=I thought the fourth son was stupid enough, but the third son is even dumber! The stuff must be stored in the armory, not the medicine room!
talk_free_48015=If I get it earlier than my brothers, I will be supreme.
talk_free_48016=You just made use of me. I've had no part in the great plan of the Fire-Cloud Villa.
talk_free_48017=I'll kill all of you and get the four keys.
talk_free_48018=After the old donkey tells me how to cool down the gun barrel, I will be supreme.

talk_free_48020=You should feel honored to die by my hand.
talk_free_48021=I don't care how many people you have. I will beat you all at once to save myself.
talk_free_48022=I never imagined that in the end I'd be set up by my four dearest disciples!
talk_free_48023=I am the only one who has the right to kill my disciples. Anyone who touches them will be enemies of the Fire-cloud Villa.
talk_free_48024=My Tianmen Divine Array is finally complete. The world will be thrown into chaos.
talk_free_48026=I'm almost done practicing the Nine-Yin Scripture. When I finish it, I will become the greatest kung fu master.
talk_free_48027=I'll kill all who stand against me after I perfect my kung fu skills.
talk_free_48029=Everything in the world is as illusive as a cloud, as transient as the morning dew. Bear this in mind.
talk_free_48030=Divine powers will protect us from hell.
talk_free_48031=There is no invincible kung fu in this world. There are only invincible minds.
talk_free_48501=Green Cloud Castle and Five-element Flag have never had close relations, so how can they ask to be rescued by our Flag Lord now?
talk_free_48504=The Flag Lord said no living creature may come any closer.
talk_free_48505=Even Green Cloud Castle came to our aid.

talk_free_48518=The day when Huoyun Villa unifies all approaches.
talk_free_48519=Who dares to look down upon Fire Cloud Villa? Those like Shaolin and Wudang are nothing.
talk_free_48520=If we find it, it will bring us a lot of of money!
talk_free_48521=The castle lord's plan is perfect.
talk_free_48522=Let's play them off against each other. We can stand by and benefit from it, then clean them out when they are weakened. Oh, what a wonderful plan!
talk_free_48523=As soon as the castle lord designs an all powerful weapon, we will be supreme.
talk_free_48524=Let's drink our soup while the lord is eating.
talk_free_48525=We will be famous after tonight.
talk_free_48526=The cycle of Yin and Yang is endless. Two ends come to Jiugong (Nine Houses). If you understand the principles of Yin and Yang, the world will be in your hands.
talk_free_48527=Take Jiu Gong as Jiu Xing, but Ba Men follows Jiu Gong. When Jiu Gong meet Jia, it would be Zhi Fu, and Ba Men can be pointed clearly.
talk_free_48528=Qi and Men all belong to Taiyin. It is very difficult to obtain three. If you get two, you are also very lucky, everything you want will come true.
talk_free_48529=If found to be the internal section, then there will be problems within the country. If found to be the external section, there will be problems arising from outside the country. If found to be the 7th stem, the country will loose in the war for sure and need to strengthen defense.

talk_010802_3180_01=You mustn't break religious precepts now that you're a monk.
talk_010803_3180_01=To achieve anything, you must work hard.
talk_010804_3180_01=Practice hard, soon you will be the same as me.
talk_010805_3180_01=Ah, you are new too.
talk_010806_3180_01=I hope you can get use to the simple food we eat here at Shaolin.
talk_010801_3181_01=Merciful Buddha! What a talent from this generation of Shaolin disciples.
talk_010802_3181_01=Amitabha! Your fighting skills have improved, but do go resting on your laurels.
talk_010803_3181_01=Amitabha! He's never had any experience learning martial arts, yet he's progressing so quickly!
talk_010804_3181_01=It seems you practice much harder than I do.

talk_010806_3181_01=You've made some serious progress.

talk_010802_3184_01=If you have any trouble, please tell me!
talk_010803_3184_01=Shaolin's future is in your hands.
talk_010801_3185_01=Amitabha! Now you're arhat, and you must protect the dignity of all the arhats.
talk_010802_3185_01=You have lived up to my expectations today and have accomplished much.
talk_010803_3185_01=With your cultivation speed, you will soon catch up with me.
talk_010804_3185_01=Make good use of morning study time and recite the classics.
talk_010801_3187_01=Shaolin's future is in your hands.
talk_010802_3187_01=I'm pretty sure I already complimented your skills.
talk_010803_3187_01=Shaolin has always had good relationships with the heroes who fight here.
talk_010804_3187_01=I don't seem to be able to follow your steps.
talk_010805_3187_01=You are my target for cultivation.
talk_010806_3187_01=Even a lowly monk like me has heard of your great talent!
talk_010802_3188_01=Shaolin's future will depend on you.
talk_010803_3188_01=Amitabha! But advancement does not end with physical form. Strive to cultivate your character.
talk_010804_3188_01=I'm certain I'll be able to catch up with you.
talk_010801_3190_01=You're the very best of our generation.
talk_010802_3190_01=Amitabha! I actually didn't misread you at all. I think you'll do great things for Shaolin.
talk_010803_3190_01=Well, you could come and talk to me about the Buddha when you are free, instead of practicing all the time.
talk_010802_3191_01=I think kung fu suits you.
talk_010802_3192_01=Now that you have become a temple supervisor, you should behave yourself.
talk_010803_3192_01=Your duty as manager is very important.
talk_010801_3193_01=Amitabha! Look at these achievements. Your hard work has paid off.
talk_010802_3193_01=You've made such an achievement! I'm assured to let you take over Shaolin!
talk_010803_3193_01=Your state of mind doesn't seem stable.
talk_010804_3193_01=I will reach your level some day.
talk_010805_3193_01=You're so great! To become a Zen Master at such a young age!
talk_010806_3193_01=Zen Master, greetings!
talk_010801_3194_01=By this point I've given you everything I can. In the future you must rely on yourself. Amitabha.
talk_010802_3194_01=Now that you have become an abbot, you shouldn't act on impulse any more.
talk_010803_3194_01=Brother, would you care to trade a few practice shots with me?
talk_010804_3194_01=When can I be like you?
talk_010805_3194_01=Greetings, Abbot! I'm not slacking off, promise!
talk_010806_3194_01=Greetings, Abbot! What orders do you have for me!
talk_010804_3195_01=At the Arhat Hall they pay attention to brute force but never research the Buddhist scriptures.
talk_010805_3195_01=I also want to join Arhat Hall.
talk_010803_3196_01=One tenet of Arhat hall is to practice during the coldest time of winter and the hottest part of summer.
talk_010804_3196_01=From now on we can make progress together!
talk_010802_3197_01=Great, you can practice the kung fu of the Arhat Hall to such a point at such a young age.
talk_010803_3197_01=Amitabha! Keep up the good work.
talk_010801_3198_01=Amitabha! You are the new arhat in the Arhat Hall.
talk_010802_3198_01=Amitabha! I knew you wouldn't let me down! Keep at it.
talk_010803_3198_01=Amitabha! Just remember not to get a big head just because you've accomplished things.
talk_010804_3198_01=You are a model for our generation. Amitabha.
talk_010801_3200_01=Oh, You're so outstanding in Prajna Hall and have entered Arhat Hall!
talk_010802_3200_01=I hope you can practice as hard as you did at Arhat Hall when you practice at Prajna Hall.
talk_010803_3200_01=Joining Prajna Hall shows that your kung fu skills have reached a very high level.
talk_010804_3200_01=You've really done us a favor.
talk_010805_3200_01=I will enter into Highest Wisdom Hall some day.
talk_010806_3200_01=Nice to meet you, Elder Brother.
talk_010802_3201_01=You can't give up halfway when you practice kung fu. You must stick with it.
talk_010803_3201_01=You are well versed in kung fu. You only need to improve your internal skills.
talk_010804_3201_01=Brother, you have set an example for us.
talk_010801_3203_01=Once you become an arhat of Prajna Hall, you'll be responsible for guarding the temple. Merciful Buddha!
talk_010802_3203_01=You are an Arhat, yes, but you should continue to practice.
talk_010803_3203_01=Amitabha! In the future, you will be responsible for the security of the temple.
talk_010802_3204_01=Amitabha! I knew you wouldn't let me down!
talk_010802_3205_01=Amitabha! In just a few years, and you have become the respected figure at Prajna Hall.
talk_010803_3205_01=Amitabha! You're far more talented than I am, Martial Brother.
talk_010801_3206_01=Your skills are improving.
talk_010802_3206_01=Amitabha! Your form is nearly perfect.
talk_010803_3206_01=My brother is so talented.
talk_010804_3206_01=I'm certain I'll be able to surpass you.
talk_010805_3206_01=I'll become very strong some day.
talk_010806_3206_01=Amitabha! You are worthy of Shaolin's hope, honored one.
talk_010801_3207_01=Amitabha! In the future you shall rely on yourself for cultivation.
talk_010802_3207_01=Don't be slack. Practicing martial arts is like swimming against a current. Once you start slacking, you'll only find yourself going backward.
talk_010803_3207_01=Although you've become the host, you still work hard.
talk_010804_3207_01=Abbot, can you show me how to cultivate?
talk_010805_3207_01=Abbot, You're so strong.
talk_010806_3207_01=Ah? Abbot, I...
talk_010701_3208_01=You should be studious when you cultivate, and never be lazy.
talk_010701_3209_01=You need to have a good basis when you practice kung fu.
talk_010701_3226_01=You can't bear even a little hardship?
talk_010701_3228_01=Go ahead! I have no time to manage your things.
talk_010701_3231_01=Go ask your Shifu when you have questions.
talk_010701_3233_01=you've got such achievement in such a young age. Amazing!
talk_010701_3234_01=You have practiced martial arts diligently.
talk_010701_3235_01=Go on ahead, you'd better think deeply when you are free. It's your own experience.
talk_010701_3213_01=You must be a Wudang disciple with kung fu skills like that.
talk_010701_3215_01=Don't be proud. You should work hard when practicing kung fu.
talk_010701_3218_01=You really stand out.
talk_010701_3221_01=Wow I saw you in the right light, all right. In such a short time you've accomplished so much!
talk_010701_3222_01=Don't be proud. You should work hard when practicing kung fu.
talk_010702_3208_01=Alternate work with rest when you practice kung fu.
talk_010702_3209_01=You should know the martial arts of Wudang stresses the unity of one's will and one's environment.
talk_010702_3226_01=Learn to walk before you can run. Learn kung fu gradually and you will progress quickly.
talk_010702_3228_01=Ask me if you have questions. I'll try my best.
talk_010702_3231_01=Your reward is well deserved for all the work you have put in.
talk_010702_3233_01=You've progress so quickly. You'll learn even more if you join the Chi Clan.
talk_010702_3234_01=Wudang is a wellspring of great kung fu masters.
talk_010702_3235_01=You seem to break out again. Do you want to join us?
talk_010702_3213_01=It won't be long before you can uphold the proper, traditional teachings.
talk_010702_3215_01=Congratulations! Your kung fu has advanced again.
talk_010702_3218_01=You must have had some serious breakthroughs from the way your temple's bulging.
talk_010702_3221_01=You've progress so quickly. You'll learn even more if you join the Chi Clan.
talk_010702_3222_01=Feel free to ask me for help. I'll do my best.
talk_010703_3208_01=I never thought your cultivation would progress this quick!
talk_010703_3209_01=You have made progress in kung fu. Let's have a duel.
talk_010703_3225_01=Don't think you're the only one who's advanced. I have, as well!
talk_010703_3226_01=Seems I'm not the only one who has progressed quickly.
talk_010703_3228_01=Ah, you have reached to such high level in such short time.
talk_010703_3229_01=I wonder when I can get to such a high skill level.
talk_010703_3232_01=Your kung fu abilities are really something! I don't compare.
talk_010703_3233_01=What if I could make a breakthrough in just seconds, the way you did.
talk_010703_3234_01=Are you new here? Work hard!
talk_010703_3235_01=You should learn kung fu step by step. Be patient.
talk_010703_3212_01=Well, work hard. I did the same back then.
talk_010703_3213_01=You need to perservere when you practice kung fu, or you will never succeed.
talk_010703_3215_01=We must support each other and make common progress.
talk_010703_3216_01=It's no big deal. You just advanced a bit faster than I did.
talk_010703_3218_01=If Shifu spares no effort to teach me, I will improve as quickly as you have.
talk_010703_3219_01=Your kung fu has progressed significantly, but don't look down on us.
talk_010703_3220_01=I'm certain to make a breakthrough soon. I won't fall behind you.
talk_010703_3221_01=Your kung fu has progressed significantly, but don't look down on us.
talk_010703_3222_01=I'm certain to make a breakthrough soon. I won't fall behind you.
talk_010704_3208_01=Oh, are you new here?
talk_010704_3209_01=Are you new here? I never saw you before!
talk_010704_3224_01=You can't give up halfway when you practice kung fu. You must stick with it.
talk_010704_3225_01=Learn to walk before you can run. Learn kung fu gradually and you will progress quickly.
talk_010704_3226_01=Kung fu's not easy.
talk_010704_3228_01=Don't think you're some great master what with that smattering of kung fu you know. You're still weak.
talk_010704_3229_01=How can Wudang have such a stupid disciple like you!
talk_010704_3231_01=Ah, it's you, Younger Martial Sister.
talk_010704_3233_01=Young martial sister, you are even more beautiful than I last saw you.
talk_010704_3234_01=Ah, let me take you to visit Wudang Mountain, Younger Martial Sister.
talk_010704_3235_01=Young martial sister, it's been a long time since we met last time. I missed you so much!
talk_010704_3211_01=Hm! You're just on good terms with the masters. What's so amazing about that?
talk_010704_3212_01=If I could be taught by the great masters, I'd never lose to you.
talk_010704_3213_01=I'm surprised that you could beat me in such a short period.
talk_010704_3215_01=If I had your luck, I too could advance that quickly.
talk_010704_3216_01=Diligence will pay off. You've already learned something today.
talk_010704_3218_01=From now on, you will be in charge of maintaining justice here.
talk_010704_3220_01=Congratulations! We are blessed with yet another skilled master.
talk_010704_3221_01=It won't be long before you can uphold the proper, traditional teachings.
talk_010704_3222_01=Diligence will pay off. You've already learned something today.
talk_010705_3208_01=Since we are in the same sect now, I will take great care of you.
talk_010705_3209_01=I never thought your cultivation would progress this quick!
talk_010705_3223_01=You have made progress in kung fu. Let's have a duel.
talk_010705_3224_01=Don't think you're the only one who's advanced. I have, as well!
talk_010705_3226_01=It seems we have both progressed a lot!
talk_010705_3228_01=Although your martial skills are better than mine, I'll never give in.
talk_010705_3229_01=Are you new here? Work hard!
talk_010705_3233_01=You should learn kung fu step by step. Be patient.
talk_010705_3234_01=Well, work hard. I did the same back then.
talk_010705_3235_01=You need to perservere when you practice kung fu, or you will never succeed.
talk_010705_3210_01=We must support each other and make common progress.
talk_010705_3211_01=It's no big deal. You just advanced a bit faster than I did.
talk_010705_3213_01=If Shifu spares no effort to teach me, I will improve as quickly as you have.
talk_010705_3215_01=Your kung fu has progressed significantly, but don't look down on us.
talk_010705_3216_01=I'm certain to make a breakthrough soon. I won't fall behind you.
talk_010705_3220_01=You are highly skilled! I don't think I'll ever achieve what you've achieved!
talk_010705_3221_01=You must practice very hard before.
talk_010705_3222_01=You're so great! Can you give me some advice?
talk_010706_3208_01=I don't know how long it will take me to reach your level!
talk_010706_3209_01=Let us work together and strive to reach the next level.
talk_010706_3223_01=What we are practicing now is the basis. Shifu told us that only with a solid basis can we enter a higher level.
talk_010706_3228_01=You want to fight?
talk_010706_3233_01=As new comers, we must help each other.
talk_010706_3234_01=You are my practice goal, I must catch up with you.

talk_character14_01_01=Go away, I don't want to drive you away by myself, go as far as possible.
talk_character14_02_01=I don’t want to talk to you.
talk_character14_03_01=Have you got anything to do? Otherwise I'm going out to get a tan.
talk_character14_04_01=Hey, it's you! Can you do me a favor?
talk_character14_05_01=Well, it's you! Help yourself.
talk_tg01_01_02=have you come up here for our kung fu?
talk_tg01_01_03=Your kung fu improved so fast! Can you kindly tell me who your Shifu is?
talk_tg01_01_04=I seldom interfere with society. I just want to have an easy life.
talk_tg01_01_05=It's been a while, how are you? I've discovered a whole new style of sword skills. Let's have a duel when you are free!
talk_tg01_01_06=Do you know my eldest disciple, Gu Xiaotian? He didn't do anything wrong, but there's still a lot of people who wish him dead.
talk_tg01_02_02=Did you come all the way down here to pit your kung fu techniques against mine?
talk_tg01_02_03=I haven't seen you for days yet your martial arts have advanced so much!
talk_tg01_02_04=I'm a woman who has no interest in martial arts or power. I just hope our eldest brother is well!
talk_tg01_02_05=Please be easier on me the next time we fight.
talk_tg01_02_06=As a woman, there are many things beyond my control.
talk_tg01_03_01=I'm Gu Xiaotian, the first brother of the Four Huanhua Heroes.
talk_tg01_03_03=Ah, I lost again. But it's just so much fun practicing with you!
talk_tg01_03_06=How many things can a person care about when he lives in this world? My Younger Martial Sister is my only concern.
talk_tg01_04_01=I'm Liang Yingfeng, the second brother of the Four Huanhua Heroes.
talk_tg01_04_03=It's my destiny to fight with a Master like you. I wonder if it's also destiny for me to lose so many times?
talk_tg01_04_04=You will never be disappointed. I'm so lucky to have you all as friends.
talk_tg01_04_05=We've fought a couple of times already and I admit you are more skillful than me.
talk_tg01_04_06=I don't care that other people I am fickle in matters of love. But I'm afraid that Feiyan would think so too. What would I do if she thought so?
talk_tg01_05_01=I'm Jun Huaiming, the third Brother of the Four Huanhua Heroes.
talk_tg01_05_02=I was defeated several times in the past and today I lost yet again. What a shame!
talk_tg01_05_03=Failure is not a big deal! Just keep trying. Those failures are valuable experiences.
talk_tg01_05_04=People believe that I am the one who cares about victory the most among the Huanhua Four Heroes, but everyone's got it wrong.
talk_tg01_05_05=Come back and duel with me some time, I'll beat you sooner or later!
talk_tg01_05_06=To me, winning or losing is not that important. I just hope to make my Shifu proud of me!
talk_tg01_06_03=Cultivating kung fu is not an easy job. Defeating me doesn't make you invincible!
talk_tg01_06_04=I was once energetic and arrogant like you.
talk_tg01_06_05=Since you can defeat me, Ximenfeiyan, I am sure you will do well in the future.
talk_tg01_06_06=The only thing I'm looking forward to is growing old with Yingfeng.
talk_tg02_01_01=I am Dongfang Yuhuan, leader of the Tianxiang Tea Forest.

talk_tg02_01_04=As a woman, I have to be especially careful when traveling.

talk_tg02_02_01=I am Ye Nanzhi, a man of sacrifice from Tianxiang Tea Forest.
talk_tg02_02_02=Since you ran into me, I'm going to beat you to a bloody pulp!
talk_tg02_02_03=After you practice here for some time, you'll learn a lot more than just martial arts.
talk_tg02_02_04=I don't care! Death means nothing to me!
talk_tg02_02_05=You've improved your Breath since the last time we met.
talk_tg02_02_06=I'm your guy, fieldmaster. I will do everything for you.
talk_tg02_03_01=I'm Qin Xiuxiu, Female Envoy of Tea Forest.
talk_tg02_03_02=Did you come all the way down here to pit your kung fu techniques against mine?

talk_tg02_03_05=I will only duel with you if you promise to only use 50% of your skill.
talk_tg02_03_06=I would do anything to serve Tea Forest.
talk_tg02_04_01=I'm Situ Jing, Tea Forest Guard.
talk_tg02_04_02=You want to mess with Tianxiang Tea Forest? You'll have to get past me first!
talk_tg02_04_03=You haven't been here for so long, I thought you were scared!
talk_tg02_04_04=Those troubles in Tea Forest are inevitible. Since there is no way to get away easily, let's escape by any means necessary.
talk_tg02_04_06=I am ambitious. How can I stay here among those women in the Tea Forest? I want more power!
talk_tg02_05_01=I'm Si Kou, the tea-picking girl in green.
talk_tg02_05_02=Most of the workers at Tianxiang Tea Forest are girls, so please be lenient!
talk_tg02_05_03=Tell me some interesting stories!
talk_tg02_05_04=The world is complex. If I don't disguise myself like this, I would inevitabley be bullied.
talk_tg02_05_05=Somehow it's kind of boring without you messing with us in Tianxiang Tea Forest. Strange, eh?
talk_tg02_05_06=I'm a normal woman, having a quiet life would be a dream.
talk_tg03_01_03=You should really practice your kung fu!
talk_tg03_01_04=I may be a playboy, but I'm no philanderer. It's all a huge misunderstanding!
talk_tg03_01_05=Please come to us if you need helpers. We will do our best.
talk_tg03_01_06=As the castle leader, my responsibility is heavier than most people can imagine.
talk_tg03_04_02=I'm not interested.
talk_tg03_04_03=I always treat others politely. Please don't be our enemy!
talk_tg03_04_04=I like making friends more than drinking wine!
talk_tg03_04_05=You're so good at kung fu. I hope we shall meet again so we can have another go at it!
talk_tg03_04_06=Things are difficult to predict. Sometimes you can't change things even though you hate them to the core. Maybe that's just life.
talk_tg03_05_03=Just because you've defeated me a couple times doesn’t mean you're awesome.
talk_tg03_05_04=It is impossible not to be miserable here.
talk_tg03_05_05=Come fight me!
talk_tg03_05_06=Those bizarre martial arts skills always interested me. Maybe I should study them.
talk_tg03_08_01=I'm Xu Xinning, daughter-in-law of the Xu Family Manor Leader.
talk_tg03_08_03=Blah. You've got nothing in the way of fighting skills.
talk_tg03_08_04=The Castle Lord raised me, so I won't betray him!
talk_tg03_08_05=You should make use of your martial arts by doing good deeds!
talk_tg03_09_03=It was a pleasure dueling with you!
talk_tg03_09_05=Have you made any progress in your kung fu?

talk_tg04_01_03=Your kung fu is terrific! Why don't you join us?
talk_tg04_01_04=Few people know the great power of these huge weapons. Where can I find someone who understands me?
talk_tg04_01_05=I hope one day we can fight again.
talk_tg04_01_06=I do things based on morality. But sometimes bad guys take advantage of me for that!
talk_tg04_02_01=I'm the eldest second son in Xu Family Manor, Xu Ziqing.
talk_tg04_02_02=There are always plenty of people who want to have a duel in Xu Family Manor, you must be one of them!
talk_tg04_02_03=Your skills have already surpassed mine. Good job.
talk_tg04_02_04=I'm the oldest son of the Xu Family Manor, and I'm meant to inherit my family's legacy, be it good or bad!
talk_tg04_02_05=You're so good at kung fu! Remember to use it well.
talk_tg04_02_06=Much talk fills the air at the villa. My powers are limited at the moment, so I must become stronger and solve this gossip problem!
talk_tg04_03_01=I am Xu Ziling. Second son of Xu Family Manor.
talk_tg04_03_02=Why are you stirring up trouble in front of the gate to Xu Family Manor?
talk_tg04_03_03=It is dangerous here, be careful!
talk_tg04_03_04=I'm the kind of person who becomes stronger when I duel with someone more skilled.

talk_tg04_04_01=I'm Xu Zishuo, third son of Xu Family Manor.
talk_tg04_04_02=Have you come to Xu Family Manor for a duel?
talk_tg04_04_03=You are prohibited from wandering around here!

talk_tg04_04_05=You're so good at kung fu! I'm impressed.
talk_tg04_05_01=I'm the fourth daughter of Xu Family Manor, Xu Zixi.
talk_tg04_05_02=I want to know what you are doing at my villa.
talk_tg04_05_03=If you keep disturbing the peace in Xu Family Manor, I will kill you!
talk_tg04_05_04=The sword is a gentleman; a person's sword skill can demonstrate his personality.
talk_tg04_05_05=Your skills are very impressive. I have learned much from you.
talk_tg04_05_06=It would be nice if the villa could be peaceful and all the families lived in harmony. To not be burdened by fame and wealth, sigh!
talk_tg05_01_01=I am Nangong Aotian, Master of the Nangong Family.
talk_tg05_01_02=Come to Nangong residence and compete in martial arts.
talk_tg05_01_03=You still lack experience. You need to know how to hide your thoughts.
talk_tg05_01_04=It's always something at the Nangong Residence, isn't it. It's always something at the Nangong Residence, isn't it. Sometimes it all just wears me down!
talk_tg05_01_05=You seem more mature.
talk_tg05_01_06=These children haven't known true suffering. The pressures of the Mansion will crush them.
talk_tg05_03_01=I am Nangong Jun, eldest son of the Nangong Family.
talk_tg05_03_02=The Nangong family have never been concerned with petty affairs.
talk_tg05_03_03=You look like you've had a hard life.
talk_tg05_03_04=Only the white robe and the long sword can match my status as the eldest son of the Nangong Family.
talk_tg05_03_05=We got to know each other through our martial arts. But meeting again today, you seem to be a different person!
talk_tg05_03_06=I did all these things to gain my father approval. What I want is actually very simple.
talk_tg05_04_01=I am Nangong Ping, second son of the Nangong Family.
talk_tg05_04_02=Have you travelled all this way to duel with us?
talk_tg05_04_03=It's been days since we last met, and here you are again. I suppose you've learned something new, then. Let's see it!
talk_tg05_04_04=There's no such thing as good or evil weapons. They just have pros and cons.
talk_tg05_04_06=Aloofness is just my way of protecting myself. It has nothing to do with whether I like the person or not.
talk_tg05_05_02=Did you came to Nangong Family to challenge us?
talk_tg05_05_03=We haven't met for a few days. Your skills must have improved already!
talk_tg05_05_05=You come at the right time! I've comprehended new movements since last time we got apart. Come on! Let's fight!
talk_tg05_05_06=Most of the seniors of the mansion say I'm not mature enough. But they barely want to know what the real me is!

talk_tg05_08_05=Your martial arts have obtained the certain status. Your mental state must have got the some level.
talk_tg05_08_06=The world is a dangerous place, and many things are not what they seem.
talk_tg05_10_01=I am Nangong Jue, eldest young master of the Nangong Family.
talk_tg05_10_02=Why have you come to Nangong Residence?
talk_tg05_10_03=There are many evil people, bear this in mind when traveling.
talk_tg05_10_04=If you want to accomplish great things, you must give up on those things that are not needed. You cannot destroy your own future over love!
talk_tg05_10_05=Show me the unique martial arts skills you've learned!
talk_tg05_10_06=The world is dangerous. You need to use any kind of means if you want to gain authority. I've never regretted what I have done.
talk_tg06_01_02=Are you willing to join my sect?
talk_tg06_01_03=Bah, what lousy skills! Not even worth mentioning.
talk_tg06_01_04=Sage Chuchen has found an old book.
talk_tg06_01_05=You have come to join our sect. I can give my second seat to you.
talk_tg06_01_06=I don't know what kind of special prescription my younger martial sister will make for me. Ha, I'm looking forward to it!
talk_tg06_02_02=Why don't you be my little brother?
talk_tg06_02_03=Your Martial Art Skills have progressed, but you still lag far behind me.
talk_tg06_02_04=The other day I killed a large snake and gave its gall to my shifu. He was very excited.
talk_tg06_02_05=You have fantastic martial arts skills. I wish you long life!
talk_tg06_02_06=I recently invented a powerful new move called the Phantom Poison Palm.
talk_tg06_03_02=Come and be the guinea pig for my new poison!
talk_tg06_03_03=Your Martial Art Skills have progressed so much, yet it still lag far behind my poisoning skill.
talk_tg06_03_04=I want to catch a colorful toad as a gift for my master.
talk_tg06_03_05=My poison skills aren't enough to defeat you.
talk_tg06_03_06=I was injured but with Yuyangzi's healing I have recovered completely.
talk_tg06_04_02=You have good chivalric style!
talk_tg06_04_03=Do you know any beautiful girls? Introduce me to some!

talk_tg06_07_02=What are you looking at?
talk_tg06_07_03=My poison skills are exceptional!
talk_tg06_07_05=Do you know where I can get some special poison around here?
talk_tg06_07_06=I accidentally killed Sage Zhaixing's viper a few days ago. I lied that it had died fighting another poisonous animal, and he actually believed me!
talk_tg06_08_02=Do you want to drink?
talk_tg06_08_03=I've got a pretty good alcohol tolerance!
talk_tg06_08_04=I got a magical book in the valley. Sage Tianxiao and I swiped it together. But then we fought over who should keep it and I lost it.
talk_tg06_08_05=Come on! Let's raise up our glasses and get drunk!
talk_tg07_01_01=I am Liu Tai, Helmsman of the Salt Gang
talk_tg07_01_02=It's either for buying salt or seeking trouble with the Salt Gang. What have you come here for?
talk_tg07_01_03=I've made some progress in martial arts. Let's fight.
talk_tg07_01_04=Trouble's inevitable, what with all the differences of opinion in the sect. I have no idea but watching this going on!
talk_tg07_01_05=I haven't seen you for some time. I was hoping you wouldn't return.
talk_tg07_01_06=I have known the leader since we were children. I do have some opinions about his doings. But he is my brother, so I cannot betray him!
talk_tg07_02_01=I am Hu Buchou, Helmsman of the Salt Gang.

talk_tg07_02_06=I was born to a humble family, but I managed to earn this position.
talk_tg07_03_01=I am Hong Zhaoyang, leader of the Salt Gang.
talk_tg07_03_02=You came here to challenge us and for no other purpose!
talk_tg07_03_03=Learning martial arts requires comprehension.
talk_tg07_03_04=As the Leader, I'm tired of dealing with different forces outside of our sect. But there's instability within our organization as well. Such troubled times we live in!
talk_tg07_03_05=The affairs of the world are ever-changing. Presumably, you are not so insistent like before.
talk_tg07_03_06=People consider me dissolute. Actually I just love Huanxiu.
talk_tg07_04_01=I am Chen Huaixiu, wife of the Salt Gang Leader.
talk_tg07_04_02=If you are here for a challenge, I'll have to inform you that the female members of the Salt Gang fear no one.
talk_tg07_04_03=You haven't come to the Salt Gang in a while. Itching for a fight, are we?
talk_tg07_04_04=Everyone admires me as the lady of the Salt Gang. But who knows how I suffer?
talk_tg07_04_05=You've come to the Salt Gang to make trouble on several occasions. You're so patient but you have no memory!

talk_tg08_01_01=I am Xianxia Sect Leader, Zhongsun Sheng. Why did you come to find the Xianxia Sect?
talk_tg08_01_02=Your kung fu is not bad. Come on!
talk_tg08_01_03=You've improved more quickly than my senior disciple!
talk_tg08_01_04=Once there was a man provoking my Penglai. He was obsessed with swords. And he has great sword skills. So I didn't hurt him.
talk_tg08_01_05=You're talented and have made rapid progress. It's time to look for a stronger opponent.
talk_tg08_01_06=I'll go study supreme sword skills. But I feel worried about my disciples. It's a shame Linggong's so old, otherwise I'd let him manage these things.
talk_tg08_02_01=I am Xianxia Sect Elder, Nan Yiweng. Is this your first time to Xianxia Sect? Feel free to wander around.
talk_tg08_02_02=You come here often. Are you interested in Xianxia Sect's Sword Skill?
talk_tg08_02_03=Friend, are you willing to play a few games of weiqi with me?
talk_tg08_02_04=I'd live in seclusion if it weren't for my disciples.
talk_tg08_02_05=Little friend, you have such good cultivation despite being so young, your Shifu must be very happy.
talk_tg08_02_06=I feel a little uncomfortable and need a rare remedy.
talk_tg08_03_01=I'm Qu Zhongqiu, the Great Doctor Nan. But you get on my nerves, so don't expect any help from me!

talk_tg08_03_03=If you have something to say, say it now. I'm busy. If you're sick you'll just have to wait till I'm free to check up on you.
talk_tg08_03_04=It's unwise to get on my bad side.
talk_tg08_03_05=You again? ! Where does it hurt? If it's just a minor illness go find someone else. I only treat the most serious of ailments.
talk_tg08_03_06=This plant is poisonous but it still cured his injury.
talk_tg08_04_01=I am Xianxia Sect's First Disciple, Shen Chong. Where are you from, sir?
talk_tg08_04_02=Sir, you look familiar. It's destiny that we meet each other. Let's make friends.
talk_tg08_04_03=Friend, you fight well. I'm impressed.
talk_tg08_04_04=My carelessness once cost good men their lives. Never again.
talk_tg08_04_05=Let's drink for a while and talk about martial arts.
talk_tg08_04_06=To be honest, after the master the person I fear the most is the second martial brother. When he practices swordsmanship he's always mumbling all these ancient incantations and mumbo jumbo. It's creepy.

talk_tg08_05_02=You come here often. Are you interested in Xianxia Sect's Sword Skill?

talk_tg08_05_05=Your martial arts prowess is legendary. I hope you use it for good.
talk_tg08_05_06=The leader wants me to in charge of the school, but I'm old and cannot handle the workload.
talk_tg08_06_01=I am Xianxia Sect's Second Disciple, Xue Shaohua. What did you come here for?
talk_tg08_06_02=When friends visit from faraway places, I'm so happy, so I invite my friend to walk around.
talk_tg08_06_03=Great teachers produce great disciples. Your martial arts skills are more or less like my eldest martial brother's. I can introduce you some time.
talk_tg08_06_04=I was born into a famous literary family. I came to Penglai Island after a long journey to learn skills because I loved sword skills. Now I miss my father and mother so much.
talk_tg08_06_05=There is an important guest coming today.
talk_tg08_06_06=Elder Brother is good in all aspects except that he doesn't pay much attention to etiquette. He lacks a certain gravitas and can be impulsive.

talk_tg09_01_05=You've made rapid progress. Come duel me if you get the chance.

talk_tg09_02_01=I am Nishang Palace Eldest Martial Sister, Bian Lingjun.
talk_tg09_02_02=Did you come because you are interested in Nishang Palace's kung fu?
talk_tg09_02_03=Do Nishang Palace's martial arts and beautiful scenery satisfy you?
talk_tg09_02_04=During your travels, you have surely perfected the art of seduction, right?
talk_tg09_02_05=My martial arts have improved. Please give me some advice!
talk_tg09_02_06=The Five Immortal Sect has been creating problems for Nishang Palace. That's a bit of an issue, so I've brought people with me to set fire to the Five Immortal Sect. That should keep 'em busy.
talk_tg09_03_01=I am Nalan Qing'er, Second Martial Sister of Nishang Palace.
talk_tg09_03_02=Did you come because you are interested in Nishang Palace's kung fu?

talk_052602_3434_01=I'm such a well-known martial artist outside of the Salt Gang, yet here I'm just a lowly disciple.
talk_052701_3434_01=You're so weak, an ant would put up a bigger fight than you. Now begone!
talk_052702_3434_01=You'll die a painful death right here. There's no need to call upon the villa's experts.
talk_052801_3434_01=I'd rather not kill you, as that would only stain my clothes.

talk_050501_3435_01=You fools want to ruin Fengming Villa? Our traps alone are enough to kill you all.
talk_050502_3435_01=My kung fu is not enough to counter the secret devices in your villa. But it's more than enough to defeat you.
talk_050601_3435_01=No one can survive Black Wind Mountain. Do you know why?
talk_050701_3435_01=You won't have the chance to fight with the three masters unless you defeat me, but I don't think you stand a chance!

talk_050901_3435_01=I'll have you know that I've killed plenty of martial artists like you since I've been here.
talk_050902_3435_01=I will not let you cause any more trouble here!
talk_051001_3435_01=In my eyes, you are merely a corpse in the making.
talk_051101_3435_01=Even if you can beat the tower guards, you will still have to face me. You shall face imminent death.
talk_051201_3435_01=My firearm doesn't discriminate friend from foe. Be careful, otherwise you'll be killed in the blink of an eye.
talk_051202_3435_01=You might have great skills, but compared to the firearms in my hand, you're just prey.
talk_051301_3435_01=Unless you can learn the Nine Yin Manual, I'll always defeat you.
talk_051401_3435_01=Fight me when you can defeat the disciples from the Guild. You're no match for me now!
talk_051501_3435_01=No, no, and no! I won't fight with you, no ifs, ands or buts! Your death is inevitable.
talk_051502_3435_01=I will kill you today. Let's fight. I want to see if you can defeat me in the first three rounds.
talk_051802_3435_01=With your meager skills, you don't stand a chance to defeat me, to say nothing of our school's experts.
talk_051901_3435_01=If you want to live, you should give up the martial arts and raise a family!
talk_052001_3435_01=With your crippled pig skills you'd be lucky if you managed to get a hit on one of our tea servants. And you want to beat me?!
talk_052101_3435_01=Any miracle-working doctor is unable to detoxicate the the secret poison by Five Immortal Sect. Once you're poisoned, you will die of blood loss within an hour.
talk_052201_3435_01=I'll spare you the suffering when I kill you.
talk_052401_3435_01=Even great kung fu masters crumble before our Energy-melting Skill. To say nothing of your abilities!
talk_052501_3435_01=Our knights in every field of endeavor. Someone like you can't even rank in.
talk_052602_3435_01=I suppose we could be incense bearers in other sects.
talk_052801_3435_01=Bow down to me this instant!

talk_060106_3435_01=You are good for cultivating, then you must succeed one day.
talk_050201_3436_01=I never expected your kung fu would be this good. I shouldn't go so easy on you.
talk_050401_3436_01=You want to fight? The loser cuts off his own arm...
talk_050501_3436_01=You might be able to avoid the secret devices, but you won't pass my test.
talk_050801_3436_01=If you, with your kung fu skills, decide not to work for me, I'm afraid we'll have to eliminate you.
talk_050901_3436_01=You want to harm our school? You'll have to get through me first.
talk_051201_3436_01=What's the use of your kung fu? You can't withstand a single blow of the firearms of our school.
talk_051501_3436_01=It seems you'll only hurt us in the future.
talk_051601_3436_01=No matter how good you are, compared to me, you are worthless.
talk_051701_3436_01=You must be killed soon.
talk_051801_3436_01=So people say your kung fu is exceptional. If you can get past my sword, I'll agree with them.
talk_051901_3436_01=Your existence will threaten me, Mizong, so we must kill you first.
talk_052101_3436_01=No kung fu is powerful enough to counter our sect's poison. There's no need for you to resist.
talk_052401_3436_01=No matter how powerful you are, my Energy-melting Skill will turn you into a cripple!
talk_052601_3436_01=If you don't cooperate with our sect, don't blame me for being cruel.
talk_060201_3436_01=We uphold justice here. Be prepared to work hard!
talk_060203_3436_01=Mind your own business or I won't be so polite!
talk_050901_3437_02=You are powerful, but if you want to do harm to our guid I will never let you pass.
talk_051801_3437_01=You are the first one who can be neck and neck in sword skills with me. Let's fight another day after I deal with our school affairs.
talk_052401_3437_01=No matter how powerful you are, my Energy-Melting Skill will turn you into a cripple!
talk_060201_3437_01=Ha! Stay warm-hearted and always help the poor and weak.
talk_060203_3437_01=No matter how amazing your kung fu is, I'm not be afraid of you! If you try to get in the way of my good deeds, I won't be lenient with you.

talk_beattacked_29004=Your skills are so limited. Let me show you something awesome!
talk_beattacked_29005=I didn't know you were good at this! Now we're playing for keeps!
talk_beattacked_29006=How can you pretend to be a hero with such pitiful skills! I'll tear you to pieces!
talk_beattacked_29007=Such basic kung fu! I've overestimated you.
talk_beattacked_29008=Come on, let's see what you've got! I'd like to see!
talk_beattacked_29009=Since you are here, why don't you join me for a while.

talk_beattacked_29504=How dare you beat me? Brothers, bring it on!
talk_beattacked_29505=Stop pretending to be a hero with such basic skills!
talk_beattacked_29506=You do know a little kung fu after all!
talk_beattacked_29507=My gosh! It's killing me! Could you be a little more gentle?
talk_beattacked_35001=You know something about the martial arts here!
talk_beattacked_35002=You're just mediocre. Take this!
talk_beattacked_35003=With these novice skills, don't even dream of climbing Sacrifice Cliff!
talk_beattacked_35012=You don't realize just how far out of depth you are. You're at death's doorstep, buddy.
talk_beattacked_31016=Basic kung fu! I think I have thought too much of you.
talk_beattacked_31017=Heh heh, I'm afraid I'll have to cut you up to bits. Sorry!
talk_beattacked_37014=This guy is hard to fight, brothers, everyone charge together!
talk_beattacked_37015=We have more people, so don't be afraid.
talk_beattacked_37016=Don't bother trying to resist, just give up!
talk_beattacked_37018=I don't believe it! I can't defeat you!
talk_beattacked_37019=No more than basic kung fu.
talk_beattacked_37020=You fight like a novice, how dare you come here!
talk_beattacked_37021=You don't live up to your reputation
talk_beattacked_37023=Come on, with all your skills.
talk_beattacked_45001=You dare come to Cavern of Lost Souls with these novice skills?
talk_beattacked_45002=Are you trying to tickle me?
talk_beattacked_45003=I haven't tasted blood in a while.
talk_beattacked_45004=This is all you've got?
talk_beattacked_45005=Today I will show you the true skills of Wanderer's Valley!
talk_beattacked_45006=Good. Today I will play with you.
talk_beattacked_45007=Blood! It's bleeding. I'll fight it out with you!
talk_beattacked_45008=One of us will die today.
talk_beattacked_45582=You're not as useless as the elder said. Still, he asked you to die, so you shall die!
talk_beattacked_48001=Nothing more than the most basic kung fu.
talk_beattacked_48002=If you stay here, I won't go easy on you.
talk_beattacked_48003=You are quite good.
talk_beattacked_48004=Try to withstand more of my moves.
talk_beattacked_48005=I expected you to have decent kung fu, but you're a sham.
talk_beattacked_48006=I thought I'd keep you for a while, but that won't be necessary.
talk_beattacked_48007=You've really got some skills.
talk_beattacked_48008=Now I have to use my special skills.
talk_beattacked_48009=Fool! You really think your flimsy skills can hurt me?
talk_beattacked_48010=I'll demonstrate my power to you.
talk_beattacked_48011=Such weak skills and you are pretending to be a hero.
talk_beattacked_48012=That’s all you've got? You disappoint me.
talk_beattacked_48013=What pifling attacks! You barely made a scratch on my armor!
talk_beattacked_48014=What do you think of my axe?
talk_beattacked_48015=Your skills might be enough to scare a toddler, but me? What a comedian!
talk_beattacked_48016=You think you can defeat me with those girly skills?
talk_beattacked_48018=You want to hurt me? You are over-confident.
talk_beattacked_48019=Why don't you give me all you got? It'll be a chance for me to practice.
talk_beattacked_48020=You have such weak skills, yet you boast so much.
talk_beattacked_48021=Repent and be saved. He who lays down his butcher knife at once becomes a Buddha.
talk_beattacked_48022=Today I'll have to kill the demons!
talk_beattacked_48023=Amitabha!
talk_beattacked_48501=I thought you had some kung fu skills. Looks like I was wrong.
talk_beattacked_48502=Seriously? Only basic kung fu? How dare you come here.
talk_beattacked_48503=You don't live up to your reputation
talk_beattacked_48504=Now the gloves come off. Taste the power of the Five Elements Flag!
talk_beattacked_48505=Give me everything you've got!
talk_beattacked_48506=Who am I? Who are you?
talk_beattacked_48507=Oh, it itches! So… itchy!
talk_beattacked_48508=Heh, hee hee hoo hoo, ha. *Crazed*
talk_beattacked_48509=Horrible! Horrible…
talk_beattacked_48510=Don't leave me, don't leave me!!!
talk_beattacked_48511=From now on I won't be lenient with you!
talk_beattacked_48512=For me, it's just shoddy kung fu.
talk_beattacked_48513=You messed with the wrong person.
talk_beattacked_48514=You're about to reach the level I was at when I was 12 years old.
talk_beattacked_48515=Looks like I'll have to actually try when I fight you!
talk_beattacked_48516=Didn't you eat?
talk_beattacked_48517=I thought about sparing you life, but I changed my mind.
talk_beattacked_48518=I've seen enough of your shoddy kung fu.
talk_beattacked_48519=The consensus at the Fire-Cloud Villa is that you're just a weakling!
talk_beattacked_48520=How dare you interfere with the Fire-Cloud Villa's affairs!
talk_beattacked_48521=You call youself hero with such meager skills? I could beat you with one hand tied behind my back!
talk_beattacked_48522=You must be joking!
talk_beattacked_48523=Your skills amount to nothing! Go back home to the farm!
talk_beattacked_48524=You deserve it!
talk_beattacked_48525=You know too much. I'll kill you!
talk_beattacked_48526=If Yang Dun hides under the Yi clockwise, the Chi will distribute inversely. If Yin Dun hides under the Yi counter-clockwise, the Chi will go clockwise.
talk_beattacked_48527=Hom Peng mercury from British fire, Gong Kun Burgundy clay as main.
talk_beattacked_48528=Good luck or bad, that will be valued by fortune.
talk_beattacked_48529=There is no way to avoid bad luck, it's just destiny.
talk_beattacked_48530=Since the Eight Gods correspond to the Nine Palaces, you must consult the nine stars to determine if bears auspicious or ominous tidings.
talk_beattacked_48531=Wow, not bad at all!
talk_beattacked_48532=Ah, that is killing me!
talk_die_1=I've used only one third of my skills.
talk_die_2=Let's see how long you will remain savage!
talk_die_3=Ah.
talk_die_4=I refuse to accept that.
talk_die_5=Hero, have mercy!
talk_die_8000=You have earned yourself a bad reputation!
talk_die_8001=Bless the Phantom's Mountain Manor.
talk_die_8002=My death will have been in vain.
talk_die_8003=I will have died for not! Oh the injustice…
talk_die_8004=I never expected to be killed by guys like you…
talk_die_8005=Ah! Blood! I need a doctor! Hurry! Take me to see a doctor!
talk_die_8006=A miserable life is better than a glorious death...
talk_die_8007=I can only return the kindness of our manor lord in my future life…
talk_die_8008=It seems I shall die before finishing my life's work.
talk_die_8009=I will not stop until I've had my revenge against you!
talk_die_8010=Death is the beginning of another cycle of life. I'll wait for your company there.
talk_die_8011=You think you can escape after killing me? Brothers, seek revenge for me!
talk_die_8012=I can't take you on alone.... Guys, come on!
talk_die_8013=Others will chase you in place of me soon ...
talk_die_8014=Scoundrel... You can't escape...
talk_die_17021=I haven't lived long enough. I don't want to die yet.
talk_die_17023=You dare to kill an East Chamber agent?
talk_die_17502=Don't kill me! I'll give you everything!
talk_die_17509=You can be buried with me. See you in the netherworld.
talk_die_17510=I won't let you off the hook. See you in hell!
talk_die_17513=Don't worry about me, tell General Yue to get out of here!
talk_die_17515=Sheesh, what's the point of this?
talk_die_17516=General, I'm leaving now.
talk_die_102001=I'm not your enemy!
talk_die_102002=This... is impossible!
talk_die_102003=So I've actually been...
talk_die_102004=I won't give up!
talk_die_102005=Okay, you win.
talk_die_102006=My death is nothing. Eunuch Cao will exterminate all of you.
talk_die_102007=Clan Leader! You're not heartless... You'll... finally... perish! Brothers, I'm... coming...
talk_die_29002=How could I be defeated by a bunch of snot-nosed louts!
talk_die_29003=Shifu, I'm going to join you in heaven!
talk_die_29004=I never expected someone would be better than me in kung fu!
talk_die_29005=I shouldn't have come here no matter how much they paid me!
talk_die_29006=The price of avarice is death! How sad, so very sad.
talk_die_29007=I shouldn't have got into trouble today.
talk_die_29008=I don't want to die. I have a lot to live for.
talk_die_29010=Just you wait! The Han Family will hunt you down!
talk_die_29011=What's wrong with me? Why did I do those crazy things?
talk_die_29012=I am honored to die by your hand.
talk_die_29013=I never imagined someone's martial arts skills would be more powerful than our leader's!
talk_die_29014=I've clearly lost. But it's an honor to be beaten by a master like you.
talk_die_29015=No, it's impossible! How could I fail? Ah…
talk_die_29016=The Royal Guards won't let you go.
talk_die_29501=I don't want to die!
talk_die_29502=Mercy!
talk_die_29503=Mercy!
talk_die_29504=No!
talk_die_29505=Help!
talk_die_29506=No!
talk_die_35001=I can't believe I lost to you...
talk_die_35006=In this life or the next, I won't stop until I've done you in!
talk_die_35013=I only used a third of my power.
talk_die_45004=No!
talk_die_45006=I don't want to die!
talk_die_45007=Mercy!
talk_die_45570=Impossible! ...the Poison Altar... is the best!
talk_die_45580=*Cough*...I lost...
talk_die_48001=I always thought the Five Elements Barrier was unbeatable. How could it be cracked by several juniors!
talk_die_48002=If I can't take care of those greenhorns, how could I ever show my face again?
talk_die_48003=The Castle Lord was right! Everyone who came is good at kung fu.
talk_die_48004=With an expert like you guarding Green Cloud Castle, our leader can relax a bit.
talk_die_48005=It seems I underestimated you.
talk_die_48006=You won't get any information out of me!
talk_die_48007=I shouldn't have gotten tangled in the middle of this.
talk_die_48008=My skills are not powerful enough.
talk_die_48009=I've always thought myself the cleverest among my fellow apprentices. I never thought that I would be fooled by anyone.
talk_die_48010=How could I be used like this?
talk_die_48011=I'm so close to achieving my great plan.
talk_die_48012="Old mistakes create new shame." A true phrase indeed!
talk_die_48013=I thought nothing could penetrate this Iron Armor…but it's actually a pile of scrap iron!
talk_die_48014=I thought nothing could destroy this blade, but actually it's a piece of junk!
talk_die_48018=Kicking a man when he's down, eh? I'll hunt you down!
talk_die_48019=I can't believe I lost to a nobody like you!
talk_die_48020=You help the wicked.
talk_die_48021=Amitabha! Endless is the sea of tribulations, so don't forget to return to shore every so often.
talk_die_48501=I will haunt you from my grave!
talk_die_48502=I don't want to die. I haven't lived long enough.
talk_die_48503=In eighteen years I will be a hero again.
talk_die_48504=I shouldn't have had mercy on you.
talk_die_48505=To show mercy to your enemy is to show cruelty to yourself. This is the cold, hard truth.
talk_die_48506=Butterflies, so many butterflies.
talk_die_48507=Castle Leader! Help me! I don't want to die!
talk_die_48508=Don't close the door! Let me in! Let me in!
talk_die_48509=Oh, it itches! So… itchy!
talk_die_48510=Help me, madam! Let me in! Let me in, too!
talk_die_48511=I totally underestimated you!
talk_die_48512=Ouch! Am I dying?
talk_die_48513=How could I die like this!
talk_die_48514=I haven't lived long enough. I don't want to die.
talk_die_48515=To show mercy to your enemy is to show cruelty to yourself. This is the cold, hard truth.
talk_die_48516=I want to help Shifu.
talk_die_48518=You dare to kill someone from Huoyun Villa!
talk_die_48519=Brothers, you must avenge… me…
talk_die_48520=I'll be leaving now.
talk_die_48521=See you in hell.
talk_die_48522=I refuse to hear that.
talk_die_48523=I'll return the favor for the Castle Lord when I am in heaven.
talk_die_48524=I haven't completed it! I'll die before my time! Noooooo!
talk_die_48526=
talk_die_48527=
talk_die_48528=
talk_die_48529=
talk_die_48530=
talk_die_48531=Don't hit me! I'll tell you!
talk_die_39006=<font color="#ff0000">Tangmen is mine! Don't grab me! No! Go away! </font>
talk_special_17014=I have not fostered Mr. Sun and Mr. Jiang for twenty years in vain. I have practiced the Yin Yang Sutra Godly Skill and now will kill you!
talk_special_70031=You dare to disturb me while I study the Great Dipper Array? Well then. See the Seven Stars Array that I've studied for many years. I changed the Great Dipper Array into it.
talk_special_70047=Helmsman!
talk_special_70048=Helmsman, nice to meet you!
talk_special_70049=You forgot your purpose for coming here?
talk_special_70050=It's my fault!
talk_special_70051=Go away! Beat it!
talk_special_70052=Yes!
talk_special_70053=Yes!
talk_special_70054=We shall meet again in the future, Wudang disciples.
talk_special_70055=Stop!
talk_special_70056=Had enough of life, kid?
talk_special_70057=Help!
talk_special_70061=Elder Brother Xiang, I've prepared. Let's start.
talk_special_10001=Feel the burn!
talk_special_10003=How are you going to beat me without your kung fu skills?
talk_special_10004=Taste my special skill: Naihe Skill.
talk_special_10005=Today, you will know the true power of my Netherworld Super Skill!
talk_special_10006=Countless people have died from my golden needle. Ah! Who knows, maybe you'll be next.
talk_special_10007=Care to witness my special move?
talk_special_10008=Even dead flowers are still beautiful.
talk_special_10009=Sweet dreams!
talk_special_10010=Do enjoy the storm and thunder!
talk_special_10011=Good move! Now it's my turn!
talk_special_10012=Let me show you my famous unique skill, the Ink-Sprinkled Stab!
talk_special_10013=The Blood-Drinking Sword leaves deep wounds that aren't immediately detected. Now... feel the power of my sword!
talk_special_10014=The move is easy and incredibly useful.
talk_special_10015=The dragon's anger will devour you!
talk_special_10016=Ah… No good will come from stabbing someone in the back.
talk_special_10017=I have decades of experience. Behold the Gold Bell Shield!
talk_special_10018=My cane can reach far. Heh heh! Don't think I can't hit you when you're far away!
talk_special_10019=I enjoy seeing blood get shed.
talk_special_10020=Lets make these thieves pay.
talk_special_10021=Feel your body stiffen implacably.
talk_special_10022=There are two kinds of chi and five elements in the human body. The two kinds of chi are yin and yang, and the five elements are metal, wood, water, fire and earth.
talk_special_10024=My Seven-Damage Fist will pound you brainless!
talk_special_10025=Now try and withstand my unique skills!
talk_special_10027=Enjoy death!
talk_special_10028=Nobody can resist this power. It is as strong as mother nature. You are doomed!
talk_special_10029=Aaah! I will kill you all!
talk_special_10030=Look at my special skill. This is true unity between man and sword.
talk_special_10051=Curses! Those people are like flies, it's freaking me out!
talk_special_10053=So you think you can beat me with those weak skills?
talk_special_10054=After today there will be no more of your shenanigans. Death to you all!
talk_special_10055=That's all you've got?
talk_special_10056=Let me show you my true skill! I'm not as simple as you think I am!
talk_special_10057=I, the great Batian, got my reputation from my awesome kung fu. So don't push it!
talk_special_10059=You… you defeated me? That's preposterous!
talk_special_10060=I only show my full power to a handful of people.
talk_special_10061=You're very skilled!
talk_special_10062=Don't gloat. It's only a flesh wound!
talk_special_10063=It's time to show you my real kung fu. All of you will die here.
talk_special_10064=A pack of ignorant fools, parochial like no other!
talk_special_10065=You will pay for that!
talk_special_10066=So naive! This is funny. You thought you could beat me like this?
talk_special_10067=Don't look down on me, or you'll be sorry!
talk_special_10068=You're wasting your time.
talk_special_10069=What you're doing makes no sense at all!
talk_special_10070=The way I see it, men are just toys, nothing more!
talk_special_10071=I may be sneaky but you're all going to die!
talk_special_10072=...Is that the act of an honest person? Aha aha, did you just fight multiple attackers?
talk_special_10073=You fools had the gall to hurt me... go to hell!
talk_special_10074=It's been years since my last serious injury. This bloody scene is so exciting!
talk_special_10075=Be careful everyone. We didn’t expect them to be so powerful like this.
talk_special_10077=I don't know how much they have tortured my brother.
talk_special_10078=Speed up, everyone! They deserve to die twice!
talk_special_10079=Today, I'm going to get revenge for Shuangshuang.
talk_special_10080=To die by my Gao Li Spear will be your life's greatest honor.
talk_special_10081=Get ready, everyone! Keep moving!
talk_special_10082=
talk_special_10101=Is Gaoli hiding himself from me? I don't want to fight a weakling!
talk_special_10103=Yes! Lord.
talk_special_10104=Intruders! You're doomed!
talk_special_10106=Come again! I have been waiting for so long!
talk_special_10107=Don't kill me, I'm just a little man who obeys orders.
talk_special_10108=It took so long to break the Element Formation. You are a band of good-for-nothings. So much for that. Now that I am here, none of you can leave!
talk_special_10109=I can't expect that I, Ximen Yu, would fail one day. Is my sword too old?
talk_special_10110=...I was going to spare your life after the Breaking Method of the Sixiang Tactics was handed over but I've just changed my mind!
talk_special_10111=Do you really think I failed?
talk_special_10112=It's been a long time since I've killed anyone with my weapon. Are you ready for death?
talk_special_10113=Don't celebrate just yet. The Lord will use your blood to hold a ceremony for me.
talk_special_10115=Am I dying? Well even if I am dying, I have returned the kindness of the Lord!
talk_special_10116=I didn't expect you would be trapped so long. I can't wait any longer. But enough chit chat. Come now, fight me.
talk_special_10117=I have such excellent fighting skills. How is it you rotten scoundrels managed to beat me? Sigh, I suppose the way of heaven is not necessarily the fairest one!
talk_special_10118=This time next year will be your death anniversary. After I kill you, who dare to look down upon me, Ma Feng?
talk_special_10119=Even if I'm dead, I won't let you live well!
talk_special_10120=You should consider yourself lucky to have made it this far. But your luck ends here.
talk_special_10122=You are going to break through a very dangerous array. Everybody, come here and I'll show you the techniques.
talk_special_10124=You can't even crack the Element Formation. It would be a disgrace just to fight you.
talk_special_10125=You can be certainly called a hero with your strength. But how dare you touch my dragon scale!
talk_special_10126=Today, before your death, I will let you know the real strength of the martial arts master.
talk_special_20001=Since everyone here is a friend of Brother Zhou, I should like to tell everyone the point of this. For this journey I hope to ascend the mountain and look for the horse thieves' helpers, then save Mr. Yang's son and daughter. Then I will meet up with Brother Zhou at the inn.
talk_special_20002=Here's the Helan Mountain path that leads to the horse thief mountain stronghold. The mountain stronghold's master is Tie Bi. Everybody should treat him with proper respect.
talk_special_20003=The matter is very important. I have to be extremely careful. Please follow me, everybody.
talk_special_20004=Hey everyone, it's the brigands' mountain stronghold is up ahead. Keep in mind that we can't clash with the brigands.
talk_special_20005=Follow me.
talk_special_20006=Go straight. On the left is the inn's kitchen. The head chef is Lai Shun. On the right is the material room. There you'll find meat stuffing, wine and so on.
talk_special_20007=Here is the backyard of the inn. Most of the guests' carriages and goods are stored here. On the right side there are vegetable fields. They have potatoes and other tubers.
talk_special_20008=These are the second floor guest rooms up here. Be careful that most of the guests don't like to be disturbed. If anyone annoys the guests, don't blame me not saving your face.
talk_special_20009=Here is the front door of the inn. Exit the inn and turn right. The Longmen Pass is not far from here. If you turn left, you'll see Zhuo Town. As for He Lan Mount, you'd better not go. Horrible brigands kill all the rich men who pass by there. If they weren't there we might actually be able to get a lot of business.
talk_special_20010=Oh and one more thing. If you want to travel far away go by carriage. The carter Old Cheng is usually outside. That old duffer charges a lot, but if you don't want to get lost in the desert, he's your best bet.
talk_special_20011=Biao's brother is on his way. You will die!
talk_special_20012=Do you want to help Zhou Zhi'an?
talk_special_20013=If that's the case, kill the people who defy the East Chamber!
talk_special_20014=Now, go find the fierce lady standing next to gentleman Zhou!
talk_special_20015=You have fantastic vision! If you do well, I'll give you a nice reward.
talk_special_20016=Don't think you'll become rich after following Shen Yishan.
talk_special_20017=Have you seen the man with the aquiline nose at the door? I think he's an East Chamber spy!
talk_special_20018=You have many choices, but being a thief is not one of them. I don't care who you are; in my shop, you'd better be careful.
talk_special_20019=There is a Royal Guards' barracks at the southern end of town. And there is a mountain pass. Qiu Wuyan should be at the entrance. Tell her: For a man who is good at catching his enemies off guard, his tactics are endless.
talk_special_20020=I'm Bi Lu, nice to meet you.
talk_special_20021=Hey everyone, we have to hurry to Longmen Inn so the East Chamber doesn't find us.
talk_special_20022=How dare you assault the court officials.
talk_special_20023=Hey everyone, we'll be setting out now. Let's meet again at the inn.
talk_special_20024=We have to fight to the death to keep the kids of Mr. Yang safe.
talk_special_20025=Hey everyone, can you help me find a way to leave the pass? I'd be most grateful.
talk_special_20026=Dong Qiu, don't even think about it! You thought nobody knew your identity as a barbarian spy?
talk_special_20027=Kill Dong Qiu! We should never let him send the message to the barbarian. or maybe we won't be forgave even we died.
talk_special_20028=Since you want to die, you shouldn't blame me. After I catch Jin Huaiyu, I can get through the pass too!
talk_special_20029=Ah, to live like a hero and die like one. Fellows, if you will, please!
talk_special_20030=Cao Zhengqing...
talk_special_20031=Zhou Zhi'an, this place is covered with traps, you'll not be able to escape even with wings.
talk_special_20032=Cao Zhengqing... you eunuchs earned the emperor's trust, then you frame the faithful and abuse the court's laws. If officer Yu were alive, you won't have the guts to be so arrogant!
talk_special_20033=Well, aren't you glib! Old Yang is dead. What's the sense in saying that. Even if here were alive, what would he have been able to do? You've messed up my plans several times already, and today you will learn firsthand how we do things.
talk_special_20034=Mr. Zhou, Ms. Qiu, it's useless trying to make these monsters understand, let's just fight for the way out.
talk_special_20035=Everyone, stay vigilant! The East Chamber members won't let us go so easily!
talk_special_20036=You know how to behave in a delicate situation. Guys, let's go back.
talk_special_20037=Dear miss, if you agree to let me join you, then let's forget what happened today. Is that okay? y? I can promise you that if I am here, you can go smoothly all the way.
talk_special_20038=Mr. Zhu, I don't have a different opinion, but you should get Boss Shen's approval first.
talk_special_20039=I hope you can join us. So how can I refuse?
talk_special_20040=I'll burn this place down if you don't come out to fight.
talk_special_20041=older brother, He Biao is so arrogant!
talk_special_20042=I'll go fight with him. I want to see how fierce he really is.
talk_special_20043=Since when was Zhuo Town guarded by soldiers during daytime as well?
talk_special_20044=I heard there's a new man in town. We should be wary of his martial arts skills.
talk_special_20045=I thought you two were the top experts in this area. But you're scared even we haven't seen him.
talk_special_20046=Well I'm not scared of him. Don't worry Mr. Shen, if he dares to make things difficult for us, why, I don't care who his father is. Even if his daddy's the emperor, I'll show him a thing or two.
talk_special_20047=Go down from here, and go straight after that. Then you can enter the secret way.
talk_special_20048=Hey everyone, we have to kill as many bandits as we can, for the sake of the locals of the Shanhai Pass.
talk_special_20049=Follow me, everyone!
talk_special_20050=What are you doing?
talk_special_20051=Mr. Jin said he will let you live if you hand over your treasures.
talk_special_20052=You'd better kill me rather than take my things away.
talk_special_20053=Help me! These scoundrels are bullying me!
talk_special_20054=All right, give this to the boss. Send the corpse to Diao Buer. How fat it is. It'll make great stuffing for our steamed buns.
talk_special_20055=Gentleman Zhu, I am a lady without a home. I have had my revenge this time, so I have no worries now. But I looked forward to living in Jiangnan ever since I was a child. Gentleman, will you go with me?
talk_special_20056=It's my honor to travel with a beautiful person.
talk_special_20057=Young master, thank you so much.
talk_special_20058=Heroes, you have come just in time. Longmen Inn is a gangster hideout.
talk_special_20059=Jin said that he wanted to borrow your goods. Be sensible, he has helped you with your relationships.
talk_special_20060=You! You don't want to take my things away unless you kill me.
talk_special_20061=We heard you won't cry until you see the coffin. All must obey the rules at Longmen Inn.
talk_special_20062=Guys, come out and kill these men!
talk_special_20063=Shen Yishan, I only ask you to give me some dry foodstuffs. If you are not willing to do so, that's okay? y. Why would you kill my servant?
talk_special_20064=Ha, Jin Huaiyu, I'm not afraid of you. Was it not your greed that brought you here?
talk_special_20065=Shen Yishan, you say I'm greedy? Bold words. Today I'll kill you and fill our steamed buns with your flesh for our staff to eat.
talk_special_20066=Everyone, I shall never forget your help today. But we cannot stay here and must get through the pass as soon as possible. When you're ready we'll go to the front door of the inn and look for Dong Qiu. He'll arrange for us to get through the pass.
talk_special_20067=Hey everyone, we will be safe once we get out of the Longmen Pass!
talk_special_20068=We finally reached Longmen Pass, but this is such a heavily guarded place, I dare not pass.
talk_special_20069=Mr. Shen, don't worry. Luckily, I am familiar with the guard captain here. It shouldn't be a hard thing to get through the pass.
talk_special_20070=All right, Lord Shen and everybody, we can go now. Let's get through the pass as early as possible. We can't be careless!

talk_special_20081=Don't be afraid, everyone. If we kill all the foreign tribe members, we can escape.

talk_special_20089=We must rescue the kids of Mr. Yang.
talk_special_20090=
talk_special_20091=Hey everyone, you all are chivalrous men. Thank you very much.
talk_special_20092=Shen Yishan and his trade caravan are in Zhuo Town and they need us to bring them here. Can you help?
talk_special_20093=Take Dong Qiu and Sima Huifeng here. We need them to be the guards this time. One of them is drinking on the second floor. The other one should be nearby, too. Go and find him.
talk_special_20094=Hey everyone, we're leaving now.
talk_special_20095=You should go to look for it in the town. There should be a tavern. Go to buy several jars of wine for these soldiers.
talk_special_20096=Follow me.
talk_special_20097=Hey everyone, we have to hurry to Longmen Inn before it gets dark.
talk_special_20098=Why have you been wasting so much time? Wake up and smell the peonies, or you might end up in a bind.

talk_special_20207=
talk_special_20208=Sima Huifeng is He Biao's servant! Bring me his head.
talk_special_20209=That horrible Sima Huifeng! He Biao will seek revenge for the smallest grievance. If he controls the stronghold, he will most certainly let us off the hook.
talk_special_20210=East Chamber forces are coming. We should kill Jia Chao and Lu Xiaojiang first. They're right in the next room. Go kill them soon.
talk_special_20211=East Chamber members have encircled the inn. We can't go out by the front gate. The only hope is the secret passageway at the inn. Come on, everyone.
talk_special_20212=Hey everyone, follow me to exit the pass through the secret passageway.
talk_special_20213=Book a guest room for me.
talk_special_20214=Sima Huifeng is a bit questionable. Go probe him. If he is the horse thief's spy, come back and report as fast as you can.
talk_special_20215=Go kill Sima Huifeng. He took my money and was secretly informing the brigands.
talk_special_20216=Go find Diao Buer, and let him give you something to do.

talk_special_20220=Shen Yishan took this treasure with him. It helps.
talk_special_20221=He Biao deserves more than death. Some petty thieves want to make trouble at Longmen Inn. Do they think I'm dead or something?
talk_special_20222=There are people from the East Chamber in the second room upstairs. We should never let them collaborate with the East Chamber. Go kill them.
talk_special_20223=Tell Zhou Zhi'an that there is a secret way to the inn that leads to the outside pass. Now that the East Chamber is very powerful, we should keep our distance.
talk_special_20224=Xiang Shen has the intention, but Di Zi doesn't have any affection. This affection is continuous and the hate is won't last forever. It has already been destroyed, so let it be destroyed thoroughly.
talk_special_20225=Go find the shopkeeper's wife and book a room. It's too conspicuous in the hall. We'll be found out.
talk_special_20226=Go find Zhou Zhi'an and make his background clear.
talk_special_20227=Send these intelligence reports to Chang Xiaodian. He is at the Longmen Pass.

talk_special_20230=Go find Jin Huaiyu and ask where the secret way is. Remember, you can any every method you want.

talk_special_20239=Take the two kids to Longmen Pass for a reward. Then go back to mountain stronghold to look for me at Gold Sand Cave.
talk_special_20240=Not bad. Nowadays only dead men don't think about my money. I'll send you to hell.
talk_special_20241=A few days ago I robbed a group of merchants from the Western region. We got lot of Dream Water from them. It had been in the mountain stronghold by my brothers. Go to the mountain stronghold and find them.
talk_special_20242=older brother and Miss Qiu, I smell a stream of blood. Be careful.
talk_special_20243=Wait, these East Chamber members are so troublesome. Everyone be on the lookout for an ambush.
talk_special_20244=There are more enemies arriving, we must protect these kids.
talk_special_20245=These East Chamber guys are creepy and tough. Get ready to fight.
talk_special_20246=Mr. Shen, there may be something wrong. There are lots of footprints here.
talk_special_20247=I smell that crowd of brigands again. But they are too weak.
talk_special_20248=Everyone protects Master Shen!
talk_special_20249=We will arrive at the inn soon. Everybody, stay vigilant! These brigands are a persistent bunch!
talk_special_20250=Curse that Sima Huifeng! He even informed the brigands at the mountain stronghold. Now they're will come here. What shall we do?
talk_special_20251=Deliver the letter to the leader. He will reward you generously.
talk_special_20252=Something big is going down in the stronghold and I need to help my brothers there. Goodbye.
talk_special_20253=Hey everyone, I have no solutions. Please tell Mr. Zhou and Miss Qiu: The green mountain won't change, the flowing water is endless.
talk_special_20254=He Biao is dead but we must go back to the stronghold soon to prevent the brothers from killing each other.
talk_special_20255=older brother's right. Everybody here, please convey my apologies to Brother Zhou and Miss Qiu. It's just something I had to do.
talk_special_20256=Hey everyone, your attention please. The warlord is in the big tent in the barracks. If you succeed in sending the letter, he will generous reward you. He can make sure you're prepared for life outside the pass and will work to get you promoted.
talk_special_20257=What a He Biao. Had I known about your opportunism, I shouldn't have shown mercy on you.
talk_special_20258=He Biao, the eldest brother treats you well, but you go against his superiors and always act up. Do you think we won't kill you?
talk_special_20259=Let's see if you can live to see tomorrow.
talk_special_20260=He Biao, I have a blood feud with you. I must kill you to pay for my parents' lives, even if it costs my own!
talk_special_20261=Only you? What nonsense! Prepare to be reunited with your parents!
talk_special_20262=Follow me back to the stronghold.
talk_special_20263=Have you seen this small mountain of treasures piled up here? They were originally given to rich businessmen and powerful officials. All of them are respected men.
talk_special_20264=But, nowadays their owner is me. I'm the only powerful leader of Helan Mountain with hundreds of square kilometers.
talk_special_20265=So, you've decided to go against me, eh? Today will be your last day above ground!
talk_special_20266=I, He Biao, shall be the master of the stronghold from now on. Brothers, let's cheer!
talk_special_20267=Use this Dream Water to knock out He Biao.
talk_special_20268=So shall we get going or what? Bossing me around like this, do you take me for a dog? Well anyway, if you help me bury this letter under the tombstone in the east corner of town, I suppose we could discuss it.
talk_special_20269=The barbarian chief lives near the earth deity temple. Kill him and you've solved the problems of Longmen Pass.
talk_special_20270=Bodyguard Dong, get rid of these people. You need to beat my bodyguard first before you want to catch me.
talk_special_20271=Sir, spare my life, please! I know I'm wrong.
talk_special_20272=Hey everyone, help us to say goodbye to Mr. Zhou and Miss Qiu. Given what He Biao has done, great change is afoot for the mountain stronghold. We can't get it off our minds.
talk_special_20273=My master and I will apologize face to face if we can meet brother Zhou and Miss Qiu again. Goodbye.
talk_special_20275=Just over that wall is the territory of the Ming Dynasty. There are thousands of innocent people there.
talk_special_20276=My treasures are very valuable. I saw several people sneak into the next room just now. I think they're going to steal stuff. Let's follow them.
talk_special_20277=All right, go and tell gentleman Zhou. I can keep him safe if he follows me to get through the pass the secret way.
talk_special_20278=Today, if the barbarians capture the Longmen Pass, they will go directly to the south. Wherever they pass, it will become hell on earth.
talk_special_20280=Cao Zhengqing...
talk_special_20281=Zhou Zhi'an, this place is already impregnable. You wouldn't be able to squeeze out even if you were the greatest soldier who ever lived. Jia and Lu have scoped you guys out completely, but it didn't occur to you, heh heh, that this same day next year will be the one-year anniversary of your death.
talk_special_20282=Pah! Cao Zhengqing, you rotten eunuchs. His majesty established the East Chamber to monitor other officials and eliminate official corruption. But you spurned the King's trust and accumulated power for yourselves, framing loyal officials and other good men, making a mockery of royal law. If my respected master officer Yang were still alive, do you dare act so wantonly?
talk_special_20283=Coming in to voice your grievances like that, you must be looking for death!
talk_special_20284=Don't attempt to work with people whose way is not your way. You act sinister, do not respect to the imperial court or observe the law...... Our Ming Dynasty is ruined in your hands.
talk_special_20285=Well well. How glib you are! Yuan Shigui!
talk_special_20286=I'm here, great elder. I await your command!
talk_special_20287=Go kill them!
talk_special_20288=Yes, elder.
talk_special_20289=The subordinates you invited are very skillful. Feng Ya, help Xiao Guizi!
talk_special_20290=I will obey your command.
talk_special_20291=Everyone be careful, this person is the leader of Black Flag Guard. He learned everything he knows from Cao Zhengqing, so we should be careful.
talk_special_20292=You should be honored to be killed by me!
talk_special_20294=Prepare to die.
talk_special_20295=Let's get out of the pass through this secret tunnel.
talk_special_20296=I entrust Wu Yan and the two kids to you. Take this pass with Miss Jin and I will go out from the front door to buy you some time.
talk_special_20297=Brother Zhou. No!
talk_special_20298=I've made up my mind, so please don't try to persuade me.
talk_special_20299=I thought the famous Zhou was an indomitable hero, but it seems you are shortsighted and fear death.
talk_special_28000=Mr. Jin, if you insult brother Zhou again, please do not blame me for having to be less than polite.
talk_special_28001=Hmm. Brother Zhou, I doubt the East Chamber soldiers outside the inn are coming for you. To face them head-on would fall right into their trap. So how can you gratify your enemies but make your relatives sad?
talk_special_28002=Miss Jin, I know what you mean. But if I don't leave and the East Chamber found me here I would never be able to face the spirit of my late master!
talk_special_28003=Relax, Brother Zhou. I already ordered the waiter at the inn to delay those people from the East Chamber. Maybe it'll buy us some time. As long as we take the secret way we'll be out of the city, so no matter how hard the Royal Guards of the East Chamber look, you will be free to do more important things for the good of the country.
talk_special_28004=I will follow you through the pass, let's go.
talk_special_28005=I thought you would hide at the inn.
talk_special_28006=He Biao, I am a good man. As for this business about being a coward, you take care of it!
talk_special_28007=You should think about today when you poisoned my in that day. Today I will see, how can you escape under my sight.
talk_special_28008=Shifu, these are He Biao's followers. They could capture our followers, so let's not waste our breath reasoning with them. Kill them and recapture the mountain stronghold.
talk_special_28009=All right, He Biao. Today I will see what skills you and your brothers have. Everybody, let's go together. Kill He Biao!
talk_special_28010=If you want to kill me, you'd better get through my followers first.
talk_special_28011=Yu Da, kill them. I don't want to see them anymore.
talk_special_28012=Let's see how long can you last. Shen Er, Tao San, go to help Yu Da.
talk_special_28014=Suspicious man? Dangerous man? No. But I haven't seen the Si Ma Guard for a long time. You can go and ask him.
talk_special_28015=Wow, what a nice day today! Let's enjoy the sunshine.
talk_special_28016=He Biao, you killed my father and I won't wait another day to kill you.
talk_special_28017=I have killed countless people; I can't remember who your father is.
talk_special_28018=I know how fierce you are, but isn't this a bit much?
talk_special_28019=Oh please, Tie Bi, anyone can shoot their mouth. As for whose blade skills are keener, that is something we'll have to settle right now.

talk_special_37033=What an useless idiot! Since you let so many of those beggars go, the Helmsman of the Five Helms has noticed it already.
talk_special_37034=Who are you? You dare to poison the water?
talk_special_37035=You are responsible for these people now, so help me with them!
talk_special_37036=Idiots, how come you still haven't kill them? Must I kill them myself?
talk_special_37038=You will not be able to win against the Lord, quickly surrender.
talk_special_37039=If I was your age, I would not be so arrogant.
talk_special_37040=Please don't kill me! I'm just working according to my leader's orders.
talk_special_37042=Son, I'm coming with you.
talk_special_37043=I never though that I would suffer such a humbling defeat at the hands of someone like you...
talk_special_37044=The Tartar peoples have many elites, could you kill them all? They will seek revenge on my behalf.

talk_special_45113=I used all my internal skills to try to break apart this stone door, but injured myself in the process. I think this secret device has a special hidden power.
talk_special_45114=It's over.
talk_special_45115=I remember my father once telling me if I wanted to enter Ecstacy Cave, I must reach the very top of the Ecstacy Stone. You should give it a try!

talk_special_45136=I can't rival Sigong. It's up to you whether to kill me or to cut me. But I'm not sincerely convinced as I will die so obscurely.
talk_special_45137=You're talented, kid, but don't interfere with the Tangmen.
talk_special_45138=Tang Fan just told Grandma, so how do you know about it, Sigong?
talk_special_45139=Nothing can conceal me in Tangmen. Someone is up to something...
talk_special_45140=I see. Therefore, the so-called secret script of Tangmen is actually sheer fiction.
talk_special_45141=Secret movement? Is there anything wrong that happened at Mo Xi's Huixin Ravine...... Little guy, why are you still here? I'm very busy! Give me the medicinal catalyst and you can go.
talk_special_45142=I'm leaving.
talk_special_45143=Good sir please spare my life! Forgive me! Here is the wine pot. I won't drink another drop.
talk_special_45144=My strongest suit is not sword skills, but hidden weapons. You weren't careful with the hidden weapons. Please accept this armor as my way of saying sorry.
talk_special_45145=Your weiqi skills are first-rate. All I can offer is this script.

talk_special_45154=Spare my life! My whole family was captured, and he asked me to send you a jar of wine and a letter.
talk_special_45155=That's bad. The thing has been uncovered. I think it's best for us to leave.
talk_special_45156=Very good, very good. You should know that there are only five people in this world who can withstand the force of my move.
talk_special_45157=I really admire your unique skills!
talk_special_45158=*Cough*... I have no intention of doing it. Please don't mind it.
talk_special_45159=Since you've been wandering the world, would you happen to know anything about Du He?
talk_special_45160=A few days ago, I saw Du He in the cave of southern Yi River in Luoyang. He was badly poisoned, and I wanted to help him. But he refused, saying that he deserved to die; he also apologized to his master and Elder Brothers and sisters. Since he insisted, and I didn't force him. You can go and visit the southern Yi River.

talk_special_45164=Whoops, who hit me with the stone! Huh? What's this?
talk_special_45165=I'm having trouble dealing with this person. Brothers, come and help me defeat him.
talk_special_45166=I won't do it again. Take that woman's belongings! Just spare me!

talk_special_45181=Are you sent by the Elder? I don't believe you. Come, let us fight. I want to see what you've got!
talk_special_45182=Well apparently we were old friends. You moneygrubber! The possessions of the Royal Guard aren't so easily taken. If you don't give it back, don't even think about trying to escape.
talk_special_45183=To my surprise, that guy told you my secret. Hmm, it's been a very unlucky day today. Anyway, if you want me to leave something here, show me your skills.
talk_special_45184=I have put down the weiqi game. Go reply to Brother Qiao.

talk_special_80050513={@0:player name}, you are weaker than the other experts here. Don’t get a big head just because of your previous victory!
talk_special_80050504={@0:玩家名}, my kung fu is poor, I'll fight you today, but only if you promise not to hurt me too much!
talk_special_80050514={@0:玩家名}, you kung fu is so magical! I am afraid that my father wouldn't be able to defeat you either!
talk_special_80050701=I am old. Please tell me your name to avoid misunderstandings!

talk_special_80060803={@0:玩家名}, I will have to refill my wine glass after sending you home.
talk_special_80060813={@0:玩家名}, your kung fu is much better than before!
talk_special_80060804=What? Are you not {@0: player's name}? So you've come around and are now willing?
talk_special_80060814={@0:玩家名}, it's okay? Let us stop here. We'd better sit down and have a drink together.
talk_special_80070101=What a fool you are to have come here. When you leave you will be a ghost.
talk_special_80070111=You are very skilled. Give me your name.
talk_special_80070102={@0:Player Name}, maybe you don't remember me, but I still remember you. Today is your doomsday! Taste my moves!
talk_special_80070112=You have won this time. Next time it won't be so easy!
talk_special_80070103={@0:玩家名}, I can pit myself against the best by fighting you today!
talk_special_80070113={@0:玩家名}, you don't be arrogant, you just defeat me! My sect leader will fight you one day!
talk_special_80070104={@0:玩家名}, I will fight with you but please, go easy on me!
talk_special_80070114={@0:player name}, why bother? There's no need to start trouble with the Salt Gang.
talk_special_80070201=State your name. I never kill commoners.
talk_special_80070211=You must be very skilled to beat me... What is your name?
talk_special_80070202=You've caused a lot of trouble for the Salt Gang. I'll make sure you never leave this place!
talk_special_80070212=It seems I have underestimated your ability. Next time, I will kill you!
talk_special_80070203={@0:Player Name}, why do you insist on pestering the Salt Gang?  You will die today!
talk_special_80070213=You're lucky our leader is not here, {@0:player name}. Next time you come here you will die.
talk_special_80070204=You youngsters think you know everything! I'll show you!
talk_special_80070214={@0:玩家名}, my kung fu isn't as good as yours. Please don't punch me too hard or I might explode!
talk_special_80070301=Beg for fairness? Show me that you have what it takes!
talk_special_80070311=The man who defeats me must let me know his name. So! Tell me your name!
talk_special_80070302={@0:玩家名}? You will not beat me again. Behold, the place of your death!
talk_special_80070303=It seems you are very skilled! {@0: player's name}! Take this!
talk_special_80070313={@0:player name}, where did you learn your skills? They're so diverse!
talk_special_80070314={@0:玩家名}, the Salt Gang is not your enemy. You defeated me today, so don't go rubbing our noses in it!
talk_special_80070401=Since you've come for a challenge, tell me your name.
talk_special_80070411=Today you have defeated me. If you dare to leave me your name, I will let you die without much pain!
talk_special_80070402=Give me your best, {@0: Player Name}, and I will honor you with a quick death!
talk_special_80070412=You defeated me several times. Who is your master? I will kill you! I must kill you!
talk_special_80070403={@0:玩家名}, you are quite bold indeed. Let's fight!
talk_special_80070413={@0:player name}, you've humiliated me again! I'll have my husband cut you into pieces one of these days!
talk_special_80070404={@0:player name}, you think everyone will fear you? Not me!
talk_special_80070414={@0:player name}, your skills may be outstanding but there are lots of ugly truths you don't know about yet!
talk_special_80110111=You are quite skilled!
talk_special_80110102=You look familiar. You're so young; I urge you to flee from this place before you are in danger.
talk_special_80110112=Your martial arts skills are very good!
talk_special_80110103={@0:玩家名}, you've come to have a duel with me again? You're pretty tenacious!
talk_special_80110113={@0:player name}, your skills have progressed immensely.
talk_special_80110104={@0: player's name}, I see your martial arts are as good as I've heard. Please show me mercy.
talk_special_80110114={@0:player name}, I am not good enough to be your opponent anymore!
talk_special_80110201=It's who--who's that screaming? Who dares to raise their voice above mine! Tell me your name and let me see who you are!
talk_special_80110211=Wait! This is a mistake, it doesn't count!
talk_special_80110202=You look familiar. Have you come to make trouble last time? You don't say anything? I will beat you to speak!
talk_special_80110212=Oh! I have not recovered since I was injured last time. {@0:玩家名}, you are taking advantage of my misfortune!
talk_special_80110203={@0:玩家名}, hmm. I'll show you power of my axe!
talk_special_80110213=Aaaah! My old wounds haven't healed yet, and you've given me more! {@0:player name}, you're a vicious one!
talk_special_80110204={@0:player name}, let's make a deal. How about you hold back a bit…
talk_special_80110214=My gosh! {@0:玩家名}, be gentle! Do you want to kill me?
talk_special_80110301=Running away, are we? It's too late, you know. Now that you are my prey, I should like to know your name!
talk_special_80110311=Well, it seems I've been defeated. Please, tell me your name.
talk_special_80110312=You are so strong!
talk_special_80110303={@0:玩家名}, you again? Good. Now I can see if you've made any progress.
talk_special_80110313=I'm not strong enough. {@0: player's name}, I will defeat you!
talk_special_80110304={@0:玩家名}, let's have an enjoyable fight!
talk_special_80110314={@0:玩家名}, I really want to keep fighting you!
talk_special_80110411=Whoa... such power!
talk_special_80110402=You look so familiar. I know you are not a bad person, but let's fight!
talk_special_80110412=I lost, fair and square. Your kung fu is fantastic!
talk_special_80110403={@0:玩家名}, I won't hold back this time!
talk_special_80110413={@0:玩家名}, you inspire me! I'm looking forward to fighting with you next time!
talk_special_80110404={@0:玩家名}! Let us fight!
talk_special_80110414={@0:玩家名}, you always had me convinced!
talk_special_80110511=How strong your martial arts are. What's your name?
talk_special_80110502=You look familiar. Do you want to fight?
talk_special_80110512=Hmm. {@0:player's name}, you have great martial arts skills!
talk_special_80110503=Come on, {@0:玩家名}, let me test your skill!
talk_special_80110513=Still cannot beat you guys.
talk_special_80110504={@0:玩家名}! Come! Let us fight for another three hundred rounds!
talk_special_80110514=I may have lost, but I have to admit... that was fun!
talk_special_80120111=Hmm. I'll let you go this time. You won't have such good fortune next time!
talk_special_80120112=Ah. Craven wretch! That was a cheap shot.
talk_special_80120103={@0:玩家名}, you asked someone to attack me so that I could lose! I will use my sword style to fight this time!
talk_special_80120113=Hmm. {@0:player's name}, your skills are great.
talk_special_80120211=If my father were here, none of you would be able to escape!
talk_special_80120202=There are thieves come to make trouble several time. You are the one who come to make trouble last time. I will beat you!
talk_special_80120203={@0:玩家名}, I just wanted to meet you. Here, take this!
talk_special_80120213={@0:玩家名}, you are a bully...
talk_special_80120204={@0:玩家名}! I will kill you!
talk_special_80120311=Don't! We are friends.
talk_special_80120302=Look how frail you are. I can pinch you to death with two fingers!
talk_special_80120312=Hey… Don't run away. I will send someone to fix you.
talk_special_80120303={@0:玩家名}, I will beat you with only two strikes.
talk_special_80120313={@0:玩家名}, you win. I'll fight you next time!
talk_special_80120304={@0:玩家名}, hmm, you won by luck last time because I give you a three movement handicap. But I won't be lenient this time.
talk_special_80120314={@0:玩家名}, it was my fault...Don't hurt me, just, remain calm...
talk_special_80120401=Close the door! Unleash the dog!
talk_special_80120411=Oh...you have such excellent kung fu. What's your name?
talk_special_80120412=Hey… That's my dog. Don't hurt it.
talk_special_80120403=Sick 'em, boys! Go bite {@0: player's name}!
talk_special_80120413={@0: player's name}, it seems I underestimated you.
talk_special_80120404={@0:玩家名}, I won't go easy this time!
talk_special_80120414=It still doesn't work. I have already done my best, headmaster.
talk_special_80120501=I don't know your name, but I you'd better go. Don't waste your life.
talk_special_80120511=Your kung fu is really good.
talk_special_80120512={@0:玩家名}, put down the knife and become a Buddha.
talk_special_80120503={@0:玩家名}, you are a famous swordsman! You should not engage in killing.
talk_special_80120513={@0:玩家名}, if you don't listen to me, I won't go easy on you the next time.
talk_special_80120504={@0:玩家名}, I won't let you hurt my friend!
talk_special_80120514={@0:玩家名}, my kung fu is not good enough. I cannot protect my fellow disciples.
talk_special_80120601=My sword is shaking because of the blood. What's your name? You won't want to become a ghost without name!
talk_special_80120611=Whoa, such powerful kung fu!
talk_special_80120602=You still want to fight? You don't know your own worth
talk_special_80120612=We lost! That's... impossible!
talk_special_80120603={@0:玩家名}, do you think you can rely on luck to defeat me again?
talk_special_80120613=Are my skills worse than yous?
talk_special_80120604={@0:玩家名}, come on! Let's fight for three hundred rounds!
talk_special_80120614=I had fun, even if I did lose!
talk_special_80130101=I was listening to some music just now. You should be beaten!
talk_special_80130111=Today you win. I have not prepared well. Let's fight next time!
talk_special_80130102=You dare to come again after the lesson? Let's go at it again!
talk_special_80130112={@0:玩家名}, what underhanded tricks did you play so that I would lose?
talk_special_80130103={@0:玩家名}, come on! You won't be so lucky this time!
talk_special_80130113=How can this be? How did you beat me?
talk_special_80130104={@0:玩家名}, why have you come again?
talk_special_80130114=You useless scoundrels! Will no one come to help me?
talk_special_80130201=Did you take the silver? If not, you'll pay with your lives!
talk_special_80130211=If you don't want to give it to me, then just do it. How have you beaten me?
talk_special_80130202=You dare to come again!
talk_special_80130212=What a fierce man. What's your name? Let's fight another day!
talk_special_80130203={@0:玩家名}, you are a bad man. I'll keep throwing coins at you until you are smothered and die a slow death...
talk_special_80130213={@0:玩家名}, I don't have enough money today, see you later.
talk_special_80130204={@0:玩家名}, you steal from the rich to feed the poor? Who do you think you are?
talk_special_80130214={@0:玩家名}, why do you always bother me? I'm just an accountant.
talk_special_80130501=Be candid with me and give it to me straight. Tell me the real reason for your coming!
talk_special_80130511=You are ruthless!
talk_special_80130502=Didn't you get enough of a beating last time? Yet you come again!
talk_special_80130512=You really have some skills.
talk_special_80130503={@0:玩家名}, I've no qualms using cruel and unusual punishment on you!
talk_special_80130513={@0:玩家名}, hmm, just kill me. Don't say anything!
talk_special_80130504={@0:玩家名}, which hand do I cut first, left or right?
talk_special_80130514={@0:玩家名}, advanced kung fu. I cannot defeat you.
talk_special_80130601=Do you want to fight? Come on!
talk_special_80130611=Your martial arts are good. What's your name?
talk_special_80130602=You still want to fight? Okay, take this!
talk_special_80130612={@0:玩家名}, what advanced kung fu. I have to rest before we fight again.
talk_special_80130603={@0:玩家名}, I can give it my all for one more fight today!
talk_special_80130613={@0:玩家名}, good kung fu! If we must to fight again, we must fight again!
talk_special_80130604={@0:玩家名}, if I defeat you then you must join our guild and help us!
talk_special_80130614={@0:玩家名}, unfortunately you can't join our Guild...
talk_special_80130701=Trying to make trouble here? You've got a death wish, buddy!
talk_special_80130711=That powerful? Let's retreat.
talk_special_80130702=You dare return? Hungry for another beat-down, are you?
talk_special_80130712={@0:玩家名}, what underhanded tricks did you play so that I would lose?
talk_special_80130703={@0:玩家名}, I lost due to my carelessness last time. You won't defeat me so easily this time!
talk_special_80130713={@0:玩家名}, you are skilled in kung fu!
talk_special_80130704={@0:玩家名}, please go all out in this fight!
talk_special_80130714={@0:玩家名}, your kung fu is more powerful than mine!
talk_special_80130801=Ah! I'll pinch you to death!
talk_special_80130811=What's your name? I will fight you next time.
talk_special_80130802=You dare to come again? I'll smash you!
talk_special_80130812={@0:玩家名}, what strength you have. Amazing!
talk_special_80130803={@0:玩家名}, ho ho! You've come again? Let us fight!
talk_special_80130813={@0:玩家名}, such strength! How did you cultivate it?
talk_special_80130804={@0:玩家名}, come on, come on! Let's fight already!
talk_special_80130814={@0:玩家名}, you are always welcome to duel with me.
talk_special_80150101=Who goes there? The Ancient Tomb is no place for people to come and go as they please.
talk_special_80150111=What's your name? Why haven't I heard of someone as skilled as you before?
talk_special_80150102=Haven't you had enough beatings?
talk_special_80150112=So fierce all of a sudden. Did you leave something last time?
talk_special_80150103={@0:玩家名}, you fight well. I'm impressed with your kung fu!
talk_special_80150113=Well... It appears that I have improved since last time.
talk_special_80150114=Alright! I concede defeat. I'll admit your skills are far better than mine.
talk_special_80150201=Finally, an outsider! Let's fight!
talk_special_80150211=Wow! How powerful! I am a step ahead.
talk_special_80150202=So, you've actually come back?
talk_special_80150212=Ah. How did you improve so fast?
talk_special_80150203={@0:玩家名}, I went easy on you last time. You won't be so lucky this time around!
talk_special_80150214=I don't want to play again. I always lose.
talk_special_80150301=You wanderers are all scum.
talk_special_80150302=Well that's just great. I haven't played enough!
talk_special_80150312=Let's retreat first, and battle another day!
talk_special_80150303={@0:玩家名}, can you filthy vagrants do anything aside from fighting and killing?
talk_special_80150313=You still cannot beat me.
talk_special_80150314=It appears that I can go by myself. I just hope the headmaster can help me.
talk_special_80150401=Keep training for a few more years and come back to us.
talk_special_80150411=Oh…I'm old and can't walk well.
talk_special_80150402=You act like such children! It's time you learn!
talk_special_80150412=Wow. I looked down on you. You do have some skills.
talk_special_80150403=Are you {@0: player's name}? Let me see if your martial arts have gotten better.
talk_special_80150413=Impressive!
talk_special_80150404=For your own good, you should learn other skills that have nothing to do with fighting and killing. At least for your parents' sake...
talk_special_80150414=It appears that martial arts can protect yourself but the world is a dangerous place.
talk_special_80160101=Don't ruin my plans! Just let me accompany you.
talk_special_80160111=Alright. You've won fair and square. Now I implore you to leave as soon as possible.
talk_special_80160102=You've come several times. What persistence!
talk_special_80160112=Well, well. You win. Leave Muyun Villa as quick as you can!
talk_special_80160103={@0:玩家名}, why have you come again? I told you not to come here again.
talk_special_80160113=It's really hard to show off my skills while having to wear this.
talk_special_80160104={@0:玩家名}, you've interrupted me too many times. I can't let you off the hook this time.
talk_special_80160114=Why are there many people come to destroy my plan?
talk_special_80160201=Cloud Villa is not the place it used to be. You should leave here as soon as possible.
talk_special_80160211=Your martial arts are good, but it's still dangerous to offend the Cloud Villa.
talk_special_80160202=Why are you doing this? Cloud Villa doesn't meddle with outside affairs.
talk_special_80160212=Villa leader's character changed a lot. Will our Cloud Villa suffer a big disaster!
talk_special_80160203={@0:玩家名}, we should learn kung fu from each other today.
talk_special_80160213=Impressive! You truly have some talent here.
talk_special_80160204={@0:玩家名}, I will do my best to protect Cloud Villa's prestige!
talk_special_80160214={@0:玩家名}, it is true tha? cannot defeat you.
talk_special_80160301=Who is shouting there? I must protect the mountain villa.
talk_special_80160311=My martial arts are not good enough.
talk_special_80160302=You lost to me once, yet you dare to return.
talk_special_80160312=I see you've come prepared.
talk_special_80160303={@0:玩家名}, you won by luck last time. It won’t happen again!
talk_special_80160313={@0:玩家名}, it appears you really do have some skill.
talk_special_80160304={@0:玩家名}, you'd better flee for your life! I'm not one to make angry!
talk_special_80160401=If you want to act wildly in Cloud Villa, you'll have to deal with me, Wei Wufeng!
talk_special_80160411=Let's retreat first, and battle another day!
talk_special_80160402=Did you actually think we would let an outside run rampant through Cloud Villa without consequence?
talk_special_80160412=You still have one more trick?
talk_special_80160403={@0:玩家名}, let's fight and not hold back!
talk_special_80160413=Your martial arts improved many. It's harder and harder for me to defeat you.
talk_special_80160404={@0:玩家名}, I will give it my all this time!
talk_special_80160414=I tried my best...
talk_special_80160501=Were you sent by Emei? Take this!
talk_special_80160502=You dare to come again? I won't show mercy this time!
talk_special_80160512=You lucked out this time, but don't count on it the next time we meet!
talk_special_80160503={@0:玩家名}, I'll kill you!
talk_special_80160513=Are my fighting skills not up to par?
talk_special_80160514=I won't give up.
talk_special_80160601=Do you wish to fight? What are you waiting for?
talk_special_80160611=Impressive... Your kung fu skills are a step above our generation's, it appears.
talk_special_80160602=You want to fight yet again?
talk_special_80160612=You seem to be taking your training quite seriously.
talk_special_80160603={@0:玩家名}, I've waited a long time for this fight!
talk_special_80160613=You've improved since the last time.
talk_special_80160604={@0:玩家名}, how fun it is to fight you!
talk_special_80160614={@0:玩家名}, if we hadn't fought each other we may have never gotten the chance to become friends. Sometimes fighting can be a good thing.
talk_special_80160701=Who is shouting to disturb my good mood?
talk_special_80160711=How dare you try and harass me! Why isn't anyone helping me?
talk_special_80160702=Well that's just great. I haven't played enough!
talk_special_80160712=Hmm! Consider yourself lucky. I won't admit defeat.
talk_special_80160703={@0:玩家名}, luck was on your side the last time you defeated me, s? refuse to acknowledge it? We must fight again!
talk_special_80160713=Thug!
talk_special_80160704={@0:玩家名}, I have learned some powerful Kung Fu. This time I will make you get down on your knees and beg for mercy!
talk_special_80160714=Stop fighting! I give up!
talk_special_80170101=Who are you? Report your name!
talk_special_80170111=How can I be defeated by a nobody! Give me your name and let's have a real competition next time!
talk_special_80170102=You look a little familiar. I won't show mercy on you because of this. Watch out!
talk_special_80170112=Damn! I wont let you win next time.
talk_special_80170103={@0:玩家名},You again? Take this!
talk_special_80170113=What? I lost to you again! I don't believe it. {@0: player name}, I will challenge you again after I heal myself.
talk_special_80170104={@0:玩家名}, no matter how many times I'm defeated I will not submit to you! Let's fight again!
talk_special_80170114=All right! I know I can't beat you, so what are you going to do, {@0:玩家名}?
talk_special_80170401=Where do you come from? Tell me your name!
talk_special_80170411=Such amazing skills! Who are you?
talk_special_80170402=Sir, you've intruded upon us several times. Did you think Twelve Linked Fortress was empty?
talk_special_80170412={@0:玩家名}, I won't forget about you. Next time I will defeat you!
talk_special_80170403={@0:玩家名}, how dare you come here!? I will defeat you!
talk_special_80170413=Ah! I lost again! Eh? Why did I say "again?"
talk_special_80170404={@0:玩家名}, I've been practicing hard. You will not be so lucky this time!
talk_special_80170414=I'm just no match for you, {@0: player name}.
talk_special_80170501=Who are you? In the mood for a beat down?
talk_special_80170511=I have got to go. Tell me your name so we can duel again the next time we meet.
talk_special_80170502=You look a little familiar. But my fists can't recognize you. Bear my movements!
talk_special_80170512=Em, I've got a bit of a stomach ache. Let's fight next time.
talk_special_80170503=Your name is {@0: player name}, right? I had the trots last time. You won't have such a good luck this time.
talk_special_80170513=Ah, I think my stomach is upset. If you'll excuse me for a moment.
talk_special_80170504={@0:玩家名}, I'm incredibly ill so you had better go easy on me.
talk_special_80170514=Oh, I told you to not hit so hard, I'm afraid of you, okay? y...
talk_special_80170601=Little guy, where are you from? How dare you speak arrogantly like this!
talk_special_80170611=How could I be defeated by a nobody? Who the hell are you?
talk_special_80170602=You have come and made troubles again and again. Do you want to die?
talk_special_80170612=This is impossible! How can I lose to you? {@0: 玩家名}, I'll defeat you next time!
talk_special_80170603={@0:玩家名}, how dare you come here!? I will let you feel the pain of the Zimu Soul Dart Weapon!
talk_special_80170613=All you hypocrites do is harass people into fighting you.
talk_special_80170614=I can't believe that even with this, I still cannot defeat you, {@0:玩家名}. I hate you! I'm not willing to admit defeat!
talk_special_80170701=Who are you? Report your name!
talk_special_80170711=Such amazing skills! Who are you?
talk_special_80170702=You have escaped last time. It won't be that easy this time.
talk_special_80170712={@0:player name}, I will not forget you. Next time I will show you the power of the Earth Thundering Formation!
talk_special_80170703={@0:玩家名}, just in time! Check out my new invention!
talk_special_80170713=Just give me more time to perfect my invention and then I'll be more than willing to fight you!
talk_special_80170704={@0:玩家名}, just try my ultimate killing weapon! Ho ho ho!
talk_special_80170714={@0:玩家名}, I give up! Please, spare my life……
talk_special_80170801=Who are you? Report your name!
talk_special_80170811=Such amazing skills! Who are you?
talk_special_80170802=You have escaped last time. It won't be that easy this time.
talk_special_80170812=Your name is {@0: player name}, right? I'll remember you and I'll punish you next time!
talk_special_80170803=Hey, hey, hey! {@0: player's name}, if you don't leave anything this time, you won't be going anywhere!
talk_special_80170813=Ah! I lost again! Eh? {@0:玩家名}, why did I say "again?"
talk_special_80170804={@0:玩家名}, you again?
talk_special_80170814=Damn it {@0: player name}! Why do you choose to harass such good people?
talk_special_80180101=Before we fight, please tell me your name.
talk_special_80180111=Since you've defeated me, please tell me your name and I'll remember you.
talk_special_80180102={@0:玩家名}, I won't be as careless as last time, so be on guard!
talk_special_80180112=I can't believe that as the Leader of Dongfang Family, I'd be defeated by the same person more than once. What a disgrace. {@0:玩家名}, I'll have my revenge!
talk_special_80180103={@0:玩家名}, my Kung Fu isn't very good but I must fight you today!
talk_special_80180113={@0:player name}, you got lucky today. Don’t become arrogant due to this victory!
talk_special_80180104={@0:玩家名}, let's fight again so I can loosen up. Let's begin!
talk_special_80180114={@0:玩家名}, your kung fu is so magical, why do you not have any weapons?
talk_special_80180201=Since you've come to Dongfang Family, tell me your name.
talk_special_80180211=You can win me a bit. May I have your name!
talk_special_80180202={@0:player name}, you only defeated me by luck last time. Today I will make you beg for mercy!
talk_special_80180212=Today I was beaten fair and square by another phenomenal martial artist!
talk_special_80180203={@0:玩家名}, I, don't want to talk nonsence with you. Fight with me!
talk_special_80180213=Your martial arts skills are quite unique!
talk_special_80180204={@0:玩家名}, I am a woman, so you shouldn't hit me so hard!
talk_special_80180214={@0:玩家名}, please come to the Dongfang Residence more frequently to teach kung fu!
talk_special_80180301=Who are you? What would you like to do our Eastern Aristocratic Family?
talk_special_80180311=So you're just going to walk away? I don't even know your name!
talk_special_80180302={@0:player name}, I can't believe you dared to make trouble in the East Residence again! The only way you're leaving here is in a coffin!
talk_special_80180312=Why? My martial arts are so good now. You may have beaten me a few times, but I'll get back at you!
talk_special_80180303={@0:玩家名}, you haven't see my real power yet! I'll show you today!
talk_special_80180313={@0:player name}, you keep humiliating me! One day I promise I'll return the favor!
talk_special_80180304={@0:玩家名}, you must point out the shortcomings in my kung fu after our fight today!
talk_special_80180314={@0:玩家名}, even if I lose to you I will still have learned a lot!
talk_special_80180401=If you dare to come to our Dongfang residence for challenge, at least tell me your name!
talk_special_80180411=I'll remember today's defeat. Please tell me your name and perhaps we'll fight again some day.
talk_special_80180402=You're so naive, {@0: player name}. Do you really think your skills match up to mine?
talk_special_80180412=You beat me today, but it's not over yet! You'll pay the price for this!
talk_special_80180403={@0:玩家名}, I won't go easy just because you're young!
talk_special_80180413=I thought I'd grasped the essence of fighting, yet you beat me!
talk_special_80180404={@0:玩家名}, I will use the Unique Dongfang Family Skill. You must go all out if you wish to fight with me!
talk_special_80180414={@0:玩家名}, we should practice kung fu with each other later so that you can help me discover the secrets of Dongfang kung fu!
talk_special_80180611=Lowly creature, tell me your name. When I become stronger, I'll have my revenge!
talk_special_80180602=You are the nameless guy last time! I'll repay you the shame of being defeated.
talk_special_80180612={@0:player name}, you keep humiliating me! One day I promise I'll return the favor!
talk_special_80180603=I will defeat you, {@0:玩家名}! I'll have my revenge!
talk_special_80180613={@0:player name}, where did you learn your skills? They are really difficult to deal with!
talk_special_80180604={@0:玩家名}, you might be a famous swordsman, but I don't care, take this!
talk_special_80180614={@0:玩家名}, you defeated me today fair and square? don't regret it!
talk_special_80181301=Since you've come to Dongfang Family, tell me your name.
talk_special_80181311=I can't believe that as the Guard Hall Leader I could be defeated by someone nameless like you. Sir, what is your name?
talk_special_80181302={@0:玩家名}! I simply cannot believe that you dared to return! Today you will see my real power!
talk_special_80181312={@0:player name}, you only got lucky today. Don't look down on us!
talk_special_80181303={@0:玩家名}, if you can defeat me I will introduce you to my family!
talk_special_80181313=Your kung fu is strange. I think only the experts in the mansion can defeat you.
talk_special_80181304={@0:玩家名}, we'll be fighting again today but try to not beat me up too bad. People are watching...
talk_special_80181314={@0:玩家名}, I had wanted to introduce you to my family, but that seems silly now.
talk_special_80181411=Sir, tell me your name. When I progress in martial arts, I will fight you again!
talk_special_80181402=You come to me before I go for you. {@0: player name}, I'll let you lose thoroughly today.
talk_special_80181412=Your martial arts are better than last time, why? I refuse to obey the lost. I'll defeat you for once.
talk_special_80181403={@0:player name}, I will show you what real martial arts looks like!
talk_special_80181413={@0:player name}, my skill is still far below that of the Elders'. You shouldn't feel too cocky just because of this one victory!
talk_special_80181404={@0:player name}, I know my Kung Fu isn't as good as yours but please, don’t hold back with me.
talk_special_80181414={@0:player name}, you will become quite become famous in due time if you continue to train with the same level of intensity!
talk_special_80190101=Who are you? Tell me your name! I have no time to care about a nobody.
talk_special_80190111=How could I be defeated by a nobody? Who the hell are you?
talk_special_80190102=You look so familiar to me. Are you the admirer of our Murong Family?
talk_special_80190112=Don't feel so proud, seeing as I wasn't actually trying...
talk_special_80190103={@0:玩家名}, how dare you come here!? Feel my fists!
talk_special_80190113=Umm, {@0:玩家名}, you were able to beat me when I used half of my power. You should be proud.
talk_special_80190104={@0:玩家名}, I will use all my might this time! So unless quickly bow and concede, I will beat you so bad that even your Mother won't recognize you!
talk_special_80190114=Er, er, ah, I still couldn’t beat you, {@0:player's name}. Damn it! Shame on me!
talk_special_80190201=Who are you? Tell me your name!
talk_special_80190211=How could I be defeated by a nobody? Who the hell are you?
talk_special_80190202=You look so familiar to me. Are you the admirer of our Murong Family?
talk_special_80190212=Your martial arts are not bad. Do you have the interest to wander with me?
talk_special_80190203={@0:玩家名}, as you admire the martial arts of the Murong Family so much, I will show you all of it.
talk_special_80190213=Umm, {@0:玩家名}, you were able to beat me when I used half of my power. You should be proud.
talk_special_80190204={@0:玩家名}, you again? Take this!
talk_special_80190214=Not again... I guess I'm just no match for you, {@0: player name}.
talk_special_80190301=Who are you? Tell me your name! The martial arts of the Murong Family cannot be shown to a nobody like you.
talk_special_80190311=How could I be defeated by a nobody? Who the hell are you?
talk_special_80190302=You look so familiar to me. Are you the admirer of our Murong Family?
talk_special_80190312=Don't feel so proud, seeing as I wasn't actually trying...
talk_special_80190303={@0:玩家名}, how dare you come here!? Eat my fists!
talk_special_80190313=Umm, {@0:玩家名}, you were able to beat me when I used half of my power. You should be proud.
talk_special_80190304={@0:玩家名}, I will use all my might this time! So unless quickly bow and concede, I will beat you so bad that even your Mother won't recognize you!
talk_special_80190314=Er, er, ah, I still couldn’t beat you, {@0:player's name}. Damn it! Shame on me!
talk_special_80190401=Who are you? Tell me your name!
talk_special_80190411=Your martial arts are not bad. What's your name?
talk_special_80190402=It's not your first time visiting the Murong Family, right?
talk_special_80190412=You have some abilities. Do you have the interest to do something for our Murong Aristocratic Family?
talk_special_80190403={@0:玩家名}, I'm interested in your Kung Fu. Let's fight again.
talk_special_80190413={@0:玩家名}, it's a pity that a martial arts expert like yourself does not strive for the greater good of the people.
talk_special_80190404=So we meet again, {@0:玩家名}. I happen to pick up a few new moves and would like to fight you.
talk_special_80190414={@0:玩家名}, I need an expert like you to help me to revive my country. Are you interested?
talk_special_80190501=Who are you? Tell me your name!
talk_special_80190511=How could I be defeated by a nobody? Who the hell are you?
talk_special_80190502=It's not your first time visiting the Murong Family, right?
talk_special_80190512={@0: player name}, you got lucky, but next time... Who am I kidding, you'll probably win then too…
talk_special_80190503=You've broken in here several times already. Do you have any respect?
talk_special_80190513={@0: player name}, you're excellent, but I won't lose next time.
talk_special_80190504={@0:玩家名}, are you ready? I will use my best skills this time!
talk_special_80190514={@0:玩家名}, you are indeed a powerful man if you can overcome me that easily. I admire you!
talk_special_80190601=What's your name?
talk_special_80190611=Your kung fu is quite good. We'll battle another day.
talk_special_80190602=Do we have to compete with each other again?
talk_special_80190612=Your name is {@0: player name}, right? I'll remember you and I won't lose to you next time!
talk_special_80190603={@0:玩家名}, I demand you fight with me again! I am sure to defeat you this time!
talk_special_80190613={@0:玩家名}, your progress in kung fu is impressive, and you are stronger than last time.
talk_special_80190604={@0:玩家名}, you again? I'll duel with you for real this time.
talk_special_80190614=How fierce you are. I must admit you're better than me, {@0: player name}.
talk_special_80190701=Little guy, where are you from? How dare you make trouble for the Murong Family!
talk_special_80190711=How could I be defeated by a nobody? Who the hell are you?
talk_special_80190702=Have we fought against each other before? I don't remember because many people lost to me.
talk_special_80190712={@0:玩家名},Think you can defeat me? haven't shown my real power yet.
talk_special_80190703={@0:玩家名}, you were lucky last time. This time I will win!
talk_special_80190713=I didn't lose, I didn't try because I underestimated you. {@0:玩家名}, you better be careful next time!
talk_special_80190704={@0:玩家名},You again? I won't let you off so easily this time!
talk_special_80190714=How could I lose again? You're really tough, {@0: player name}.
talk_special_80200101=Since you've come to the Yanmen family, please tell me your name.
talk_special_80200111=Good kung fu! Who's your teacher?
talk_special_80200102={@0:玩家名}, let me go all out in our fight!
talk_special_80200112=What an amazing youth. {@0:玩家名}, you were able to seize on my fleeting moment of carelessness to gain the upper hand and win!
talk_special_80200103={@0:玩家名}, let's fight. You'd better consider joining the Yanmen Family if you can defeat me again!
talk_special_80200113=Looks like children have taken over around here. I'll show all my skills next time, {@0: player name}.
talk_special_80200104={@0:玩家名}, let me go all out when I fight with you! Please!
talk_special_80200114={@0:玩家名}, you are young, but you are already a kung fu wizard!

talk_special_80200311=You're really strong. What's your name?
talk_special_80200302=Did you came to the Yanmen Family before?
talk_special_80200312={@0:玩家名}, I will defeat you next time!
talk_special_80200303={@0:玩家名}, I study medical skills and Kung Fu. Let's fight again!
talk_special_80200313={@0:玩家名},There are few swordsmen as skilled as you!
talk_special_80200304={@0: player name}, it seems that I have no choice but to use the unique Eight Diagrams skill to defeat you!
talk_special_80200314={@0:玩家名}, if you can break the Eight Diagrams Array, it is clear that I have much to learn.
talk_special_80200401=I am Yan Guhong. May I know your name?
talk_special_80200411=You beat me! What's your name?
talk_special_80200402=You look familiar. Have we sparred before?
talk_special_80200412={@0:玩家名}, looking at your skills, you're pretty darned good at kung fu.
talk_special_80200403={@0:玩家名}, you won't win easily today!
talk_special_80200413=That was some great kung fu for someone so young. You're really something, {@0: player name}!
talk_special_80200404={@0:玩家名}, your kung fu is better than mine, let's go all out in this fight!
talk_special_80200414={@0:玩家名}, you are young, but your kung fu is excellent. I admire your skills!
talk_special_80200601=Sir, what is your name?
talk_special_80200611=You're really strong. What's your name?
talk_special_80200602=Did you came to the Yanmen Family before?
talk_special_80200612={@0:玩家名}, your kung fu is excellent, we can learn from each other later.
talk_special_80200603={@0:玩家名}, I will be much more careful this time!
talk_special_80200613={@0:玩家名}, you have progressed in kung fu again, and can be regarded as an expert in the Yanmen Family!
talk_special_80200604={@0:玩家名}, I will do my best in our fight!
talk_special_80200614=I have a lot to learn from you, {@0: player name}. Welcome to the Yanmen family. You can train here any time.
talk_special_80200701=What's your name?
talk_special_80200711=Good kung fu! Can I have your name?
talk_special_80200702={@0:玩家名}, you defeated me last time. Let's have at it again!
talk_special_80200712={@0:玩家名}, I won't be defeated so easily in our next encounter!
talk_special_80200703={@0:玩家名}, I still remember my last loss to you...take this!
talk_special_80200713={@0:玩家名}, your kung fu is very good. I will go all out in our next fight!
talk_special_80200704={@0:玩家名}, please teach me! I will pay attention to our fight today!
talk_special_80200714={@0:玩家名}, you are indeed better than the Yanmen Family at kung fu. You are always welcome to spar with us!
talk_special_80200901=Hey, who are you? Tell me!
talk_special_80200911=Good kung fu! Can I have your name?
talk_special_80200902=Did you came to the Yanmen Family before?
talk_special_80200912={@0:玩家名}, I wasn't paying attention this time.
talk_special_80200903={@0:玩家名}, are you ready to lose? Take this!
talk_special_80200913={@0:玩家名}, hmm, we have many experts in our Yanmen Family!
talk_special_80200914={@0:玩家名}, okay?y, I can't defeat you. Please teach me something if you have time!
talk_special_80201101=Who has come to bother the Yanmen Family!
talk_special_80201111=Good kung fu! What's your name?
talk_special_80201102=Have we sparred before?
talk_special_80201112=Your martial arts are extraordinary for someone so young.
talk_special_80201103={@0:玩家名}, I didn't enjoy our last fight. Let's make this fight a good one!
talk_special_80201113=You may have won, {@0: player name}, but you have many flaws.
talk_special_80201104={@0:玩家名}, let's fight! I will use all the sword skills I've practiced for so long!
talk_special_80201114={@0:玩家名}, you are a kung fu wizard!
talk_special_80210101=Suyun Palace does not concern itself with everyday affairs. So what's the trouble now?
talk_special_80210111=You come well prepared.
talk_special_80210102=I thought I sent you away. You think you're really something, don't you?
talk_special_80210112=Your skills improved.
talk_special_80210103={@0:玩家名}, we won't let you go easily just because you've burst into Suyun Palace. We'll pound you to a pulp!
talk_special_80210113=Oh...I actually lost to you. That hurt Suyun Palace's reputation, next time I'm going to make sure you are smashed to pieces.
talk_special_80210104={@0:玩家名}, to maintain Suyun Palace's prestige, I shall not pull my punches!
talk_special_80210114=Let's retreat first, and battle another day!
talk_special_80210211=You seem very skilled.
talk_special_80210202=You've returned! You must have delusions of grandeur.
talk_special_80210212=You've come prepared.
talk_special_80210203={@0:玩家名}, why do you embarrass Suyun Palace again and again?
talk_special_80210213=Your kung fu is excellent, but it's a shame your morals are questionable.
talk_special_80210204={@0:玩家名}, today's fight will be a vicious one!
talk_special_80210214=You beat me easily... I'll have to practice more.
talk_special_80210301=What a temper. You young people sure are energetic.
talk_special_80210311=Wow. Good skills. No wonder you dare to challenge our Palace Leader.
talk_special_80210302=Why are you again? Itching for another beat down?
talk_special_80210312=Are you the one from before?
talk_special_80210303={@0:玩家名}, you again? What, do you have nothing to do?
talk_special_80210313=Well, it seems you have some skills after all!
talk_special_80210304={@0:玩家名}, you're here again? ...Oh wait, I don't actually know you...why did I say "again"?
talk_special_80210314=I'm bored!
talk_special_80210401=Show me what you've got. I won't go easy on you!
talk_special_80210411=Oh...it's a good thing I'm very skillful at healing, otherwise I'd be dead by now!
talk_special_80210402=You've got to leave now!
talk_special_80210412=Don't be a such a brute. Don't you know how to treat ladies?
talk_special_80210403={@0:玩家名}, why must you embarrass me so often when I'm not your enemy?
talk_special_80210413=I am angry! You shouldn't blame me for my angry if I meet you again!
talk_special_80210404={@0:玩家名}, I'm feeling good today. Let's fight like today is our last!
talk_special_80210501=Someone dares to trespass in Suyun Palace? I recommend you leave quickly. In the past, those who did so met bitter fates.
talk_special_80210511=We'll teach you to run wild in Suyun Palace.
talk_special_80210512=How dare you sneak up on me when I'm unprepared!
talk_special_80210503={@0:玩家名}, I lost due to my carelessness last time. You won't defeat me so easily this time!
talk_special_80210513=You've progressed. I have new found respect for your martial arts skills.
talk_special_80210504={@0:玩家名}, in the name of Suyun Palace, I will defeat you for sure this time!
talk_special_80210514=What humiliation! I suppose I just need more practice.
talk_special_80210601=What's your name? Mine is Du Yunqian, and I challenge you.
talk_special_80210611=Your martial arts aren't bad at all!
talk_special_80210602=You still want to fight? Ok, I'll keep going!
talk_special_80210612=Oh...you've made great progress in such a short amount of time.
talk_special_80210603={@0:玩家名}, you've come to have a duel with me again? Show me what you've learned.
talk_special_80210613=Have I fallen behind? I feel I can't withstand a single blow.
talk_special_80210604={@0:玩家名}, I have been studying Kung Fu hard, take this!
talk_special_80210614=Eesh... okay? I give up.
talk_special_80210701=I was going to hunt but here you are all of a sudden. Let's try it out.

talk_special_80260501=Who are you? Why have you come to Lord Qin's Residence?
talk_special_80260511=By the look of your movements, I'd say you're no ordinary practitioner. Who's your master?
talk_special_80260502=I recall you'd been to the Lord's Residence before. Are you coming for a challenge again?
talk_special_80260512={@0:玩家名}, You might have the best kung fu in the world, but if you want to work for the King, you must pass the test?

talk_special_80270602=I know you but I won't show mercy!
talk_special_80270612=It's really embarrassing that you beat me.
talk_special_80270603={@0: player name}, all I did was steal a little money. Is this really justice?

talk_special_80280111=You beat me by chance today. Do you have the guts to tell me your name? You will taste my iron fists next time.
talk_special_80280102=I finally get the chance to teach you a lesson, {@0: player name}.
talk_special_80280112=Today you just got lucky. Next time I'll show you my true skills.
talk_special_80280103={@0:玩家名}, time to fight! I want to find out if you made any progress in your kung fu!
talk_special_80280113=It looks like it will be yours soon.
talk_special_80280104={@0:玩家名}, what brings you here today?
talk_special_80280114={@0:玩家名}, if you learn a new skill you should fight with me totest it! I may lose but that's ok with me.
talk_special_80280201=What should I refer to you?
talk_special_80280211=All right, so you beat me. But I won't admit defeat just yet! Tell me your name!
talk_special_80280202={@0: Player Name}, you dare to come to Baodu Stronghold. I lost to you last time, but today I'll set things right!
talk_special_80280212={@0:Player Name}, you've come to our stronghold to defeat me many times, so you will pay the price for your behaviors sooner or later!
talk_special_80280203={@0:玩家名}, how many blows will it take for you to realize you've lost?
talk_special_80280213=It looks like only the Stronghold Leader can beat you down!
talk_special_80280204={@0:玩家名}, after several days you must have made some great progress with your Kung Fu. Come on then! Fight with me!
talk_special_80280214={@0: player name}, you've made great progress with your kung fu in such a short time!
talk_special_80280301=So you are here for the stronghold? What's your name?
talk_special_80280311=There are few people that can beat me in one move. What's your name?
talk_special_80280302={@0:Player Name}, you have skills! But today you met me...
talk_special_80280312=I can't believe that you always beat me!
talk_special_80280303={@0:玩家名}, if you plan to fight my Baodu Stronghold, prepare for defeat! Take this!
talk_special_80280313=I can't believe that you just defeated my fist skills. {@0: player name}, where are you from?

talk_special_80280314={@0:玩家名}, I'm sure that I will lose!

talk_special_80280411=I will remember my failure today. Tell me your name. I will be the first one to wait for your instruction next time you come here.
talk_special_80280402={@0:Player Name}, I've waited till today at last! Today, the only way to await you is only failure!
talk_special_80280412=How could I be defeated by the likes of you? {@0: player name}, one day I will get revenge!
talk_special_80280403={@0:player name}, the Calf-Holding Stockaded Village doesn't like unwanted guests. If you are defeated by us today, don't ever return here again!
talk_special_80280413={@0:player name}, it seems the leader of the Stockaded Village has come to defeat you himself.
talk_special_80280404={@0:player name}, if you defeat me, I will start calling you warrior.
talk_special_80280414={@0:玩家名}, you deserve to be called a Master!
talk_special_80280501=Guests should intruduce themselves first.
talk_special_80280511=I lost the fight to you commoners because of my negligence today. Tell me your name!

talk_special_80280512=You've progressed so fast. Now I'm totally defeated.
talk_special_80280503={@0:player name}, you're way too arrogant! Of course, you won't be after I wipe that look off your face!
talk_special_80280513={@0:player name}, there are more experts in the Calf-Holding Stronghold other than myself. You should be cautious next time.
talk_special_80280504={@0:玩家名}, you're here again? It's only been a couple of days.
talk_special_80280514={@0:player name}, I'm so old I can't handle your power!
talk_special_80290101=You look so sneaky. Do you come to steal weapons? I will kill you!
talk_special_80290111=How can I be defeated by a nobody! Give me your name and let's have a real competition next time!
talk_special_80290102=You look familiar, but I won't be lenient! Take this!
talk_special_80290112=Curses! How could you defeat me? I won't let you win next time.

talk_special_80290201=Where did you come from? Tell me your name!
talk_special_80290211=Your kung fu is pretty good, who are you?

talk_special_80290213=I lost again! {@0:玩家名}, next time I won't go easy on you!
talk_special_80290204={@0:玩家名}, I've been practicing hard. You will not be so lucky this time!
talk_special_80290214={@0:玩家名}, your kung fu is so advanced. Would you like to be my friend?
talk_special_80290301=Who are you? You dare trespass in Heaven Treasure Stronghold?
talk_special_80290311=What's your name? Your kung fu is good.
talk_special_80290302=You look familiar, but I wonder how your kung fu is. Bring it on!
talk_special_80290312={@0:玩家名}, your kung fu is excellent, bu? didn't do my best.
talk_special_80290303={@0:玩家名}, let's fight! Martial arts experts are always good at kung fu.
talk_special_80290313={@0:玩家名}, apparently I must use my secret skill next time!

talk_special_80290314={@0:玩家名}, hmm...I couldn't defeat you this time but one day I will beat you!
talk_special_80290401=Say your name. I have no time for anybody.
talk_special_80290411=How could I be defeated by a nobody? Who the hell are you?
talk_special_80290402=I may have seen you somewhere before. Do you want to join our Heaven Treasure Stronghold?
talk_special_80290412=Don't treat me like a loser. I used only ten percent of my skill. I will beat you to your knees next time.
talk_special_80290403={@0:玩家名}, how dare you come here!? Now, experience how my fists feel on your face!
talk_special_80290413=Umm, {@0:玩家名}, you were able to beat me when I used half of my power. You should be proud.
talk_special_80290404={@0:玩家名}, I'm going all out today so you should grovel at my feet if you don't want to die!
talk_special_80290414=*Hic* Ah... I can't defeat you, {@0: Player Name}. How awful! That's going to leave a mark!
talk_special_80290501=Who are you? Whoever you are, taste my fist!
talk_special_80290511=I've got to go. Tell me your name so we can duel again the next time we meet.
talk_special_80290502=You look familiar, but I think I'll have to pound you anyway. Take this!
talk_special_80290512=Ah—— I don't feel well today. So you can see my true skills next time.
talk_special_80290503=You are {@0:玩家名}, right? Last time we battled I was ill, so you won't be so lucky this time!
talk_special_80290513={@0:玩家名}, I have other work to do today. I will punish you next time!
talk_special_80290504={@0:玩家名}, you had better not stealth attack me, or else!
talk_special_80290514=Ah? {@0:Player name} beat me again! (I should've pretended I was dead earlier! )
talk_special_80290601=Say your name. I have no time for anybody.

talk_special_80310102=Go away! I've already shown you mercy.
talk_special_80310112=Wow. I looked down on you, little boy.
talk_special_80310103={@0:玩家名}, I actually pulled my punches. Unfortunately, I have no patience for people like you who make lots of trouble.
talk_special_80310114=Am I really that old and decrepit? I keep losing to younger people.
talk_special_80310201=Why are you doing this? All that fighting and killing...
talk_special_80310211=Wow! Your kung fu skills are wonderful!
talk_special_80310202=Why do you do this? I can't strike a deadly blow. Don't bother me!
talk_special_80310212=You hide your talents quite well.
talk_special_80310203={@0:玩家名}, I am always polite when you make trouble but couldn't you stop this time? No? Then I must fight you!
talk_special_80310213={@0:player name}, everything can be discussed. Harmony is the most valuable thing.
talk_special_80310214={@0:玩家名}, it's ok that you don't want to enter the manor but why must you always attack people?
talk_special_80310301=Aren't you coming to the villa? Why are you still standing here? Are you waiting to be hit?
talk_special_80310311=Ack... so powerful. Let's retreat!
talk_special_80310302=I spared your life last time, why have you returned?
talk_special_80310312=You still got one more trick left.
talk_special_80310303={@0:玩家名}, I heard you beat my brothers! I will tear you to pieces!
talk_special_80310313=He's really tough, no wonder Gou Hun can't defeat him.
talk_special_80310304={@0:玩家名}, for the sake of our prestige, I must go all out!
talk_special_80310314=I cannot defeat you, it seems my brother is right.
talk_special_80310401=You've disturbed my slumber! I'll break you in half!
talk_special_80310411=You attacked me while I was off guard. I'll beat you next time!
talk_special_80310402=I let you go last time. This time I won't have much patience!
talk_special_80310412=Your martial arts are so good. I was careless.

talk_special_80310404={@0:玩家名}, if you would have me as your teacher I will show you a unique skill.
talk_special_80310511=Such wonderful martial arts skills! Who are you?
talk_special_80310502=My friend, please leave quickly. I need to take care of serious business, so don't waste my time.
talk_special_80310512=Oh, you got another skill.
talk_special_80310503={@0:玩家名}, come on! I will teach you a secret Shaolin Skill!
talk_special_80310513=Wow! You're so insidious!
talk_special_80310504={@0:玩家名}, you again? No more blood this time.
talk_special_80310514=Oh...my old injury is hurting again...!
talk_special_80310901=You're so young and have such a good demeanor. Let me fight you!
talk_special_80310911=He's so skillful at such a young age. It looks like the younger generation will surpass the older.
talk_special_80310902=Your kung fu is not bad but you'll get hurt if you compete with me. Leave quickly!
talk_special_80310912=You have hidden your capabilities. I've underestimated you.
talk_special_80310903={@0:玩家名}, I secluded myself here so that no one could bother me. Looks like you messed that up…Why are you looking for me?
talk_special_80310913=Your kung fu is quite good, but you lack a tolerant heart.
talk_special_80310904={@0:玩家名}, if I best you today you must promise to never bother me ever again.
talk_special_80310914=My martial arts have gotten rusty over the past few years. I can't compare with other fighters.
talk_special_80320111=I've lost to a nobody. Who are you?
talk_special_80320102=Sir, you look familiar. Are you a follower of the Heaven Net faith?
talk_special_80320113=I can't believe I've been so careless to the point of losing to you. Next time I'll try my best to defeat you!
talk_special_80320114=I failed again... The fighting skills of the central plain are fantastic. I'm so envious!
talk_special_80320201=May I have your name?
talk_special_80320212={@0:player name}, unexpectedly, I lost to you. I've underestimated the enemy.
talk_special_80320301=Who are you?
talk_special_80320311=... Great Kung Fu! Who are you?
talk_special_80320302=I've seen you before...
talk_special_80320312=...  {@0:player name}, I will remember you…
talk_special_80320303=You again!
talk_special_80320313=I'll defeat you next time.
talk_special_80320304=What does that mean?
talk_special_80320314=... {@0:player name}, It's you, good… good…
talk_special_80320401=Who are you? Tell me your name!
talk_special_80320411=I've lost to a nobody. Who are you?
talk_special_80320402=You look a little familiar. But I won't show my mercy for this!
talk_special_80320412=I lost because I was careless. {@0:玩家名}, I will have my revenge!
talk_special_80320403={@0:玩家名}, how dare you come here!? Take this!
talk_special_80320413=Don't think I've lost. I haven't used my real power!
talk_special_80320404={@0:玩家名}, I'm more powerful than the Sun! You better give up before I destroy you!
talk_special_80320414=I give up, don't hit me any more!
talk_special_80320501=Where are you from? Stirring up trouble at the Heaven Net Cult, do you want to die?
talk_special_80320511=Well, you beat me. Now, who are you?
talk_special_80320502=You look familiar. Have I thrashed you before?
talk_special_80320512=I was careless just now. {@0: player name}, I'll beat you next time!
talk_special_80320503={@0:玩家名}, it's on.
talk_special_80320513=This is impossible! How can I lose to you? You guys just have more people, I refuse to accept defeat!
talk_special_80320504={@0:玩家名}, you dare to fight me one on one?
talk_special_80320514=I've lost again. Am I really no match for you?
talk_special_80320601=Sir, what's your name?
talk_special_80320611=Such amazing skills! Who are you?
talk_special_80320602=Sir, have we met before?
talk_special_80320612=I can't believe I lost to you, {@0:玩家名}. I'll remember you from now on.
talk_special_80320603={@0:玩家名}, I lost due to my carelessness last time. You won't defeat me so easily this time!
talk_special_80320613=The Central Plain people are a bunch of louts. They gang up on people, but there was no way I'd ever give in to them!
talk_special_80320604={@0:玩家名}, you again? Why are you so mean to me?
talk_special_80320614=You've already known that no one in Heaven Net Cult is your opponent and you still come. Is it meaningful?
talk_special_80000001=Are you coming to challenge me? Tell me your name. I won't fight against any old person, you know!
talk_special_80000002=You look familiar. Is {@0:player's name} your name? Show me all your power, I won't show mercy on you!
talk_special_80000003={@0:玩家名}, I'm pleased to have the opportunity to fight you again! If you lose, you should treat me to a drink!
talk_special_80000004=Whoa. Aren't you {@0: player's name}? Easy, now, easy. Don't strike at the face. Don't completely crumble our authority!
talk_special_80000012={@0:玩家名}, You defeated me? I can't believe it!
talk_special_80000013={@0: player's name}, you always win. I need more practice.
talk_special_80000014={@0:玩家名}, your kung fu ain't half bad!
talk_special_80190690=You'll regret fighting against me.
talk_special_80190691=You'll pay for this. Go to hell!
talk_special_80190290=I'll be back!
talk_special_80320291=Long live the sect leader!
talk_special_80230190=Heh heh. Heh heh.
talk_special_80230192=Tsk tsk, yet another new corpse.
talk_special_80230193=Bird...... Tell me who should die?
talk_special_80230194=Niao Er said you must die, and so you shall!
talk_special_80230195=Who are you? Stop!
talk_special_80230390=Blood, I want blood!
talk_special_80230391=I won't stop till I've done you in! You'll pay for this!
talk_special_80230490=I'll make sure you depart this world on a river of blood!
talk_special_80230790=Somebody's coming! Help me kill him!
talk_special_81001=Stick with it! You can do it!
talk_special_81002=Sealing Steps and Hitting Acupoints Hands!
talk_special_50001=Righteous chi and true martial arts will eliminate evil.
talk_special_50002=When the wine came I drank like a fish. When I woke up I found myself in the flowerbed.
talk_special_50003=Law Splits Black and White!
talk_special_50004=Explain yin and yang!
talk_special_50006=Other disciples are troubled in the dungeon. Please save them first! I'm injured and can't walk.
talk_special_50007=Please forgive me! The Royal Guards made me do it. I have a family to feed.
talk_special_50009=You threaten me? Ha! If I am defeated, thousands of others will seek revenge for me.
talk_special_50010=A real man should take the Three Foot Sword and fight for the kingdom. But I have not an inch of blade on me, what good am I? What a shame!
talk_special_60001=Wait for a moment, please. I have something to tell you.
talk_rw_popo_01=Bless my grandson for returning home peacefully.
talk_rw_popo_02=Tianshi, Tianshi! Have you seen my grandson Tianshi? Why hasn't my grandson Tianshi come back?
talk_rw_popo_03=Thank you for your saving my grandson. I don't know how I'll repay you! I will keep you in my prayers...
talk_rw_xiangwu_01=Tianshi and I grew up together. Whenever he has anything good, he shares it with me.
talk_rw_xiangwu_02=*Sobbing* It has been a long time since I saw Tianshi. Why couldn't I find him anywhere? I asked my parents, but they refused to tell me.
talk_rw_xiangwu_03=Hey. I will go to Yanyu Villa and play with Tianshi when I am free. He can't come to Salt Gang any more. My father is so stern.

talk_special_35050=Well, you are badly injured. How could you fight with us?
talk_special_35051=Stop talking so brashly! You don't seem like good people!
talk_special_35052=Let me fight these uninvited guests!
talk_special_35053=Take this!
talk_special_35054=You defeated me!
talk_special_35055=Is this free prey?
talk_special_35056=I need your skills to practice Nine Yin White Bone Claw!
talk_special_35057=Let's see how many die at my "Nine-Yin White-Bone Claw" today!
talk_special_35058=Do you want to know how your relatives will die?
talk_special_35059=I thrust my hand into their heads and stirred their brains. It made such a satisfying sound.
talk_special_35060=Blood and brains are what I need to practice Nine Yin White Bone Claw.
talk_special_35061=They kept on begging me to spare their lives. It was the most exciting scene in the world. It was a veritable bloodbath.
talk_special_35062=So you don't fear death? Come here. If you can't beat these puppets, then just wait for me. I'll suck the marrow right out of your bones!
talk_special_35063=I might be wounded, but I swear I'll kill the first man who gets here.
talk_special_35064=This can't be! You've broken my Puppet Array!
talk_special_35065=You dare to break into the Forbidden Instance of Emei. You'll pay with your life!
talk_special_35066=Emei is a decent sect. How can we help that Monster Zhang Ruozhi hide? You're up to no good, I know it. I'm afraid you covet our scriptures and mental skill manuals.
talk_special_35067=You! You're Zhang Ruozhi!
talk_special_35068=Who there is so rude? Oh, so now you're all quiet, eh? You can forget about trying to leave here alive. I'll--(Clutches chest and sits)
talk_special_35069=You've kill countless good people!
talk_special_35070=I'm embarrassed to say that I used to be an Emei disciple. No one is more familiar with their dirty deeds than myself!
talk_special_35071=Do you want to kill me? Then you will never know the identity of the Youngest Martial Sister.
talk_special_35072=Back then my martial sister was very... "free." Em, otherwise how else could she have gotten so serious with a guy from the cult and had his child!
talk_special_35073=Damn... I've let the cat out of the bag.
talk_special_35074=What else do you want to know? I can tell you.
talk_special_35075=Do you really want to know who the parents of the youngest sister are? I won't tell you!
talk_special_35076=Ouch, you hurt me. I was going to tell you that Emei Headmaster wants to kill you.
talk_special_35077=Why did Nun Juechen kill our younger martial sister? No man loves her, thus she is jealous of the sister. Aha.
talk_special_35078=You're late. How dare you let the brothers wait for you. Do you have any respect for the elders?
talk_special_35079=Please forgive my lateness, Elder.
talk_special_35080=Fantastic! I can see how Zhao Yuchun lost to you! Now for the first time in decades the path to Sacrifice Cliff should be open!
talk_special_35081=My martial arts are just okay. Thanks to older sister Zhao, we can fortunately pass through.
talk_special_35082=No more nonsense! Come on, let me see what you've got, Abbess Jueming!
talk_special_35083=Please leave! I don't ever want to see you again! Don't be arrogant, or Elder Mieyuan of Sacrifice Cliff will punish you dearly!
talk_special_35084=This is the Sutra Pavilion, a place for cultivation. This is not the place for martial arts examinations. Leave at once! Besides, everyone knows how the test went.
talk_special_35085=Elder Martial Sister, I came here for the true story of sister Sifei. Hope you can honestly tell me about what happened these past few years.
talk_special_35086=Who has told you this? Do I know this secret? A secret of this nature must not be revealed to outsiders. And yet death claims all, so I suppose it makes no difference. As for whether or not we can ask, you'd better see what your martial sister has to say.
talk_special_35087=This way, please, Elder Martial Sister!
talk_special_35089=This is the Sutra Pavilion, a place for cultivation. This is not the place for martial arts examinations. Leave at once!
talk_special_35090=Please don't be angry. I have been told that the war from ten years ago between Emei and the cult originated from a scandal at Emei.
talk_special_35091=Those words are taboo here. I think it would be wise to just leave immediately!
talk_special_35092=You mean that, if I beat you, you'll tell me the truth?
talk_special_35093=What a fool! I have not seen anyone ungrateful like you for many years. Come on!
talk_special_35094=Fortunately for you I don't feel well today, so I'll have to wait a bit longer for my revenge!
talk_special_35095=You realize that you've broken one of our sects main rules by entering such a forbidden area, right?
talk_special_35096=Si Fei's wounds turned out to be... *Teeth chattering*
talk_special_35097=You have already completed the task.
talk_special_35098=of course, you are brave and talented. I admire you and hope you succeed.
talk_special_35099=Enough! I will leave you alone, martial sister, as I have to challenge the pass today. I will get you someday later. What was wrong with Sifei? You wretched cur! You hurt her for no reason and brought about her death.
talk_special_35100=Younger Martial Sister, don't be so impulsive. I, I didn't just cook that up. The disciples on the mountain spread that information. That young scoundrel, no, it was in that year Sifan's mother committed adultery. Her husband was so angry he killed his wife. Then he committed suicide and abandoned the infant, who was picked up by the Abbess. Isn't it that scoundrel? I'm just telling the truth. She was so angry she practically came at me with a sword! Anyway, now I'm her elder martial sister.
talk_special_35101=Shut up! I'll let you go today because you are my Elder Martial Sister. Don't blame me for cutting off our relations if I find you spreading rumors in the future. Goodbye!
talk_special_35102=Wait! Little girl, please listen to me. I'm not your enemy, right? You could kill now, it's true. But what would you gain from it? We could...
talk_special_35103=I persuade you not to waste your breath. No matter what you take to bribe me, it is your day-dreaming and let others look down upon you.
talk_special_35104=Girl, don't be so cocky. Many people think that they need nothing just because they don't know what they're missing. If you've never laid eyes on priceless treasures, amazing kung fu or powerful supreme positions, how can you covet them? You'll get these as long as you pretend that you never see me.
talk_special_35105=So those are your last words, are they? Boy that's rich! I figured it's not easy to become famous, so I at least gave you the chance to say your last words just in case. Wonderful!
talk_special_35106=Well! Suppose I told you that I know why you've trespassed into this forbidden area, and then I told you that the thing you seek is something you shall never find...
talk_special_35107=What did you say? How can you know that? How?
talk_special_35108=Well, if there were no spies in Emei, I wouldn't have come to the other side of Emei mountain and wouldn't have been seen by you. You should know that after all I'm your elder. I know more than others and dare to speak out——Anyway, those stories have nothing to do with me!
talk_special_35109=How can Sifei's issue be related to Emei? (Uh oh! )
talk_special_35110=Well, Sifei, she's the reason you've broken into the forbidden area? Right, disciples like you will not know her story. Even in the whole Emei Mountain, only a few people know. It is a dirty thing, a dirty thing indeed. It could wipe out the sect's reputation!
talk_special_35111=What you are saying?
talk_special_30040=If it was your goal to get on my nerves, you've certainly succeeded. Now die!
talk_special_30042=Get the hell out of here.
talk_special_30045=See, I have my own windmill!
talk_special_30046=Hu'erte, you're a useless idiot!
talk_special_30047=Do you really think you are the best in the world?
talk_special_30048=If it weren't for you, I'd be enjoying myself in Yanmen Pass now! Now you shall die!
talk_special_30049=Hu'erte, you idiot! You can't even handle those louts!
talk_special_30051=Fire is the strongest force in nature, wouldn't you say? Now burn, burn!
talk_special_30500=Go away! You dare to beg food from here? Otherwise, I will arrest you for spying!
talk_special_30501=There aren't enough troops in Yanmen Pass, so they are unable to help Dongquan Village. But you can take refuge in the city.
talk_special_30502=You can register with Cavalry Commander Hu Yingjie! He's in the Inner City.
talk_special_30503=You can register with Infantry Commander Cui Rui! He is in Xiang City.
talk_special_30504=Thank you for saving our village!
talk_special_30505=You are ruthless. Let's go!
talk_special_30506=Our chief will kill you all!
talk_special_30507=Look at this noisy rabble. I'll clean you out!
talk_special_30508=Die!
talk_special_30509=You vile wretch! I won't allow you to hurt these villagers!
talk_special_30510=Oh no! The Tartar's vanguard general is coming again!
talk_special_30511=In the north of the village there's a winding path that leads to the rear Tartar camp. That's where General Fang Wuhen is locked up. But the path passes though Snake Valley, where countless vipers slither across the ground and in the trees. Ordinary people have trouble passing through, so they have to use our special Poison Avoiding Medicament. Otherwise the snakes will do them in!
talk_special_30512=That's the reason why our village can be kept till today. I can't understand why so many Tartars have passed through Snake Valley. I burned all the Poison Avoiding Medicament so that the Tartars can't use it. In the meantime, you can pick up some torches to dispel the vipers.
talk_special_30513=*Cough* *Cough* *Cough*
talk_special_30514=You are still alive?
talk_special_30515=Oh no! My token is gone!
talk_special_30516=Open the door and let's beat it!
talk_special_30517=The Tartar's Marshall will not go without a fight.
talk_special_30518=We will go to the North Gate Tower to look into the situation. You rest and then come here to report the matter.
talk_special_30519=We will take care of this. You can rest. Prepare to fight with Hu Er'te under the Hall!
talk_special_30520=The first one into Yanmen Pass will get ten cattle and sheep as well as lots of gold.
talk_special_30521=Hurry up and put out the fire!
talk_special_30522=The enemy is attacking! Guards, exterminate these vile creatures!
talk_special_30523=Come on. Kill them all and protect the Marshal!
talk_special_30524=Go to the village and check if Xiao Cui is back. Dongquan Village is west of here!
talk_special_30525=Thank you. Xiaocui is my beloved daughter. I've sent people to the northern Snake Valley to find her. They'll come back soon.
talk_special_30526=Have you found Xiao Cui?
talk_special_30527=Is that you? Jin Duoliang, why are you staying with those Tartars? Have you forgotten how your father died?
talk_special_30528=Chief, you must save Xiaocui! She was kidnapped by the Tartars and they are charging a ransom of anti-snake venom.
talk_special_30530=They promised that they just needed to go through our village to attack Yanmen Pass. They wouldn't kill a single villager if we gave them the snake pill.
talk_special_30531=Idiot! The Tartars are ambitious and deceptive. They treat us Central Plain folk horribly and they're anything but honest. It'd be disastrous if they ruled over us! We were born the subjects of the Ming and shall die the subjects of the great Ming dynasty. We cannot take the cowardly path!
talk_special_30532=We tend our herds at the border of Ming Dynasty lands. We'd be doing the same even if the Yuan Dynasty were still around. Same sheep and horses either way. But, Xiao Cui and others will die soon. Actually let's not talk about the others. Xiao Cui is your daughter. Do you have the heart to see her untimely death?
talk_special_30533=I'll be pleased if my daughter could show her loyalty to the dynasty.
talk_special_30534=You might be happy, but what about the dead man! We are just humble commoners content to live peacefully. The Ming Dynasty doesn't care about us; why fight for them?
talk_special_30535=If we do this, how can we call ourselves civilized human beings?
talk_special_30537=The marshal says that if you can offer up some snake-expelling medicine within three hours, we can ensure your reunification with your family. Otherwise, when the army overcomes Yanmen Pass, this village will be razed. Let's go!
talk_special_30538=Li Xiao, go to Yanmen Pass and ask for help. I will stay here and hold them off!
talk_special_30539=All right, Village Head! I will call in the reinforcements.
talk_special_30540=Take action! If you want the Snake Expelling Incense, you'll have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands!
talk_special_30541=I think your Anti-snake Incense is fake. Jin Duoliang, go to check it.
talk_special_30543=All right, let them go! You show the way ahead, and don't pull anything funny!
talk_special_30544=You wait for us at the opposite bank. We will go soon!
talk_special_30546=I've asked the craftsmen to work overtime to make artillery. I believe the Tartar Army will be able to taste the power of my artillery soon enough.
talk_special_30548=Supervisor, you're here! Garrison Captain is waiting for you inside!
talk_special_30549=I never thought my reputation would be ruined by you villains.
talk_special_30550=If General Wei Qing were still... alive, the barbarians... wouldn't have ... passed through the Yin Mountain and invaded the... Central Plain! *Cough* Well...General Wei Qing... the Barbarians' horses...
talk_special_30551=You are over-confident, like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Have you any last words?
talk_special_30552=(Cough… Cough…)
talk_special_30553=Too scared to speak?
talk_special_30554=Why won't you admit that you were bitten by a dog?
talk_special_30555=Hey, well done. I will spare your life. If you give me three head knocks, I'll let you go.
talk_special_30556=Why's it bright outside? Someone is still sleeping. *Cough*
talk_special_30557=What an ignorant idiot!
talk_special_30558=I prefer death to humiliation!
talk_special_30559=All right, whatever you want! Kneel!
talk_special_30560=*Cough* I only kneel to heaven and earth, the emperor and my teachers. But not to animals!
talk_special_30561=You... you... you--you will be reunited with your husband in hell!
talk_special_30562=Good words never speak twice. So I'll ask you one more time: Where are the main forces of the Ming army?
talk_special_30563=Isn't it the second time?
talk_special_30564=Stop! No, say it!
talk_special_30565=You place me on the horns of a dilemma.
talk_special_30566=Don't mince the words with me! Give me the truth and confess!
talk_special_30567=What have you done to deserve to call yourself Grandaunt?
talk_special_30568=The people of the Central Plain have clever tongues. They like gaining the upper hand when talking to people. I know it very well!
talk_special_30569=You seem to be of great spirit, yet you remain elusive.
talk_special_30570=Good insight! In your words, it means I have what you don't have and I'm better than what you're good at.
talk_special_30571=What! Thief, how dare you curse me! Cut out his tongue, nose and eyes first! Bring them to me on a platter!
talk_special_30572=Great! But I think you might not last so long. I'll wait for you there.
talk_special_30573=General, he seems to look down on you.
talk_special_30574=Thank you for saving me. Here, take these!
talk_special_30575=Thank you for saving my life. Only if you bought things from me, I could give you a big discount. I will wait for you at Yanmen Pass.
talk_special_30576=Who is coming? Tell me your name! Outsiders can't come in! I will arrest you as spies if you keep peeping!
talk_special_30577=The invaders are behind the jail! They are stealing the horses! Kill them all!
talk_special_30578=Oh no, here they come again! Let's ride to the Yellow Plains! I know a secret path.
talk_special_30579=Go! It's too dangerous inside!
talk_special_30580=Quite right, quite right. They'll be dead the moment they enter.
talk_special_30581=They court death. We won't stop them.
talk_special_30582=Help! I'm on fire!
talk_special_30583=Help! Help!
talk_special_30584=Supervisor, Yanmen Pass is left for you! Please take good care of Lord!
talk_special_30585=There is a spy! Guards!
talk_special_30586=What? ! ? The spy burned the crops? Come everyone, let's search the place from top to bottom!
talk_special_30587=What are you waiting for? Go fight the fire!
talk_special_30588=Fire! Help! Hurry!
talk_special_30589=Thank you all, I will wait for your success at Yanmen Pass!
talk_buff_terminate=We're done gathering chi. Now you'll die!
talk_special_45903=It's finished then, everyone thinks I'm dead.
talk_special_45904=This is my chance. My chance to start a new life.
talk_special_45905=Little Younger Martial Sister, why are you here?
talk_special_45906=He was so panicked when he saw me. There must be something suspicious. Follow him and see.
talk_special_45907=Isn't she the youngest martial sister?
talk_special_45196=Your wine is excellent.
talk_special_45197=Come on. Would you like to play chess with me?
talk_special_45198=The Northern Desert is desolate and uninhabited. It may be safer.
talk_special_45199=Remember to walk out the Pass through Desert of Repose. They'll meet you there.
talk_special_45200=Thank you for helping me.
talk_special_45201=It's my fault. Don't beat me. I must work hard!
talk_special_45202=How dare you beat me?
talk_special_45203=Stop! Stop! I give in. I will work hard.
talk_special_45204=Aaaaaauugghhh! Quickly, give me the antidote! Some insects are biting me! Ah, my bones, my bones!
talk_special_45205=I--I'm saying, we were the ones who ambushed the Emei disciples. As for the death of Hua the Nymph, that was also the doing of Tangmen.
talk_special_45206=I only act under orders. The meeting place is the Back Room of Qingyang Taoist Temple in Chengdu. I've told you. Give me the antidote. Quick!
talk_special_45207=Uh. Uh-oh...
talk_special_45208=Go! The experts are coming!
talk_special_45209=Well, since you keep doing that, I won't let you off this time!
talk_special_45210=Thank you so much. Here is my confession. Please take it to the Flag Lord.
talk_special_41110={@0:name} wait. It's been so long. I'm surprised you're here, to be honest.
talk_special_41112=You dare slander me!
talk_special_41113=Elder Brother Lu Ming told me.
talk_special_41114=Elder Brother Lu: The Valley Leader and the sisters of Mr. Mo are very close. They don't seem like his concubines. Are they his illegitimate daughters?
talk_special_41115=Elder Brother Lu has known he made a big trouble. He has left the valley for a long time. Nobody knows where he has gone.
talk_special_41116=Rotten monks! How about I deliver you back to your gods!
talk_special_41117=Martial Nephew, you walk too slowly. This is urgent. I will go ahead with your Elder Brothers. You should try your best to meet us in Luoyang.
talk_special_42000=I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything!
talk_special_42001=You will regret it!
talk_special_42002=I won't tell you!
talk_special_42003=Travelers have more to fear than just a mere blade.
talk_special_42004=I'll remember you!
talk_special_42005=Well, it's just like scratching an itch.
talk_special_42006=Wait for me. You'll pay for this!
talk_special_42007=Ah, now that's comfortable. Once more!
talk_special_42008=You'll pay for this someday!
talk_special_42009=I'll tear you to pieces.
talk_special_42010=No pains, no itching!
talk_special_42012=My brother Wu Xiaoqing is one of Jiangnan's famous doctors. You think I'm afraid of you? Oh please!
talk_special_42013=I have Yunnan White Powder, so I'm not afraid of you!
talk_special_42014=Get me a doctor...
talk_special_42015=If I die, you won't get anything.
talk_special_42017=I can hold my own.
talk_special_42018=Well, this is nothing.
talk_special_42019=You are quite ruthless, I must say!
talk_special_42020=Ah! Don't touch that!
talk_special_42021=Hey. What are you looking at?
talk_special_42022=I--I'm not scared at all.
talk_special_42023=I asked the Sect Leader repeatedly, but he refused to tell me and then sent you to ensnare me. You've come just in time and I'd like to get a few chuckles out of teasing you. Ask the Sect Leader to tell me the truth, or I won't let it go at that.
talk_special_42024=Help us! Our escort cart is being robbed! I rushed out to seek help.
talk_special_42027=Since there is nothing left to live for, so why do I fear of death!
talk_special_42028=Aaaaaauugghhh! Nobody has the right to kill my people except myself. How dare you kill my people? How dare you! !
talk_special_80321201=My dear! You killed my husband. Go to hell!
talk_special_80321202=Oh! How are you? Did they hurt you?
talk_special_80321203=My dear! Where are you! Curses! What did you do to him? I will kill you!
talk_special_80321204=Curses! How dare you hurt my husband? I'll kill you!
talk_special_80321101=My dear! You killed my wife. Go to hell! !
talk_special_80321102=My dear! How are you! How dare you hurt her? Go to hell!
talk_special_80321104=Get out of here, all of you!
talk_special_80030190=You can't back out of this now, {@0:玩家名}. Let's fight.
talk_special_80070391=Try the bomb I bought from Thunderbolt Hall!
talk_special_80030990=It's a bit of a pain to run around like this. Well, I'll pay you no heed. Now be quiet!
talk_special_81004001={@0:玩家名}, I didn't expect that. I have to show you my real ability. Take this!
talk_special_81004002={@0:玩家名}, you've broken into Tianxiang Tea Forest. I hope you've written up a will!
talk_special_81004003={@0:玩家名}, Huanhua Sword is broad and profound. Let me show you.
talk_task_suzhou_1=Impossible! Why can't I beat you? Take this!
talk_task_suzhou_2=Impossible! You've come uninvited! You must have some ulterior motive.
talk_task_suzhou_3=How ridiculous! You're asking for death!
talk_task_suzhou_4=How ridiculous! How dare you come here with such a flimsy skill?
talk_task_suzhou_5=No idea. What are you doing here?
talk_task_suzhou_6=No idea. Do you really want to die?
talk_tqy_jzt_1=You have an exaggerated opinion of your abilities.
talk_task_qy_wudang3n_fodi=Have mercy! Please! I won't do those vicious things again.
talk_qyem_task_18464_1=No one is following us, right? It's been a while.
talk_qyem_task_18464_2=I met an elder martial sister, but I was away.
talk_qyem_task_18464_3=You'd better be careful! If Master Guwang finds out about it, I'll probably be killed.
talk_qyem_task_18464_4=Bah! Oh please, you're far too timid to earn any money.
talk_qyem_task_18464_5=Well, get to the point already. This is what you want. The way to use it is written down on paper. Go back and figure it out yourself.
talk_qyem_task_18464_6=Yeah, we have enough money.
talk_qyem_task_18464_7=How is this possible?
talk_qyem_task_18464_8=These are all my savings, no more.
talk_qyem_task_18464_9=In fact, there is a way. I can ask for less money if you know what I mean, heh heh heh. You're mighty pretty, perhaps you might...
talk_qyem_task_18464_10=I know what nonsense is flowing through your mind. Just forget it, or you'll be killed!
talk_qyem_task_18464_11=So what?
talk_qyem_task_18464_12=Bah, why do I have to read this boring manual. What about asking Gu lord for advice? He must know this.
talk_qyem_task_18464_13=What did you say?
talk_qyem_task_18464_14=I didn't say anything. I'm off.
talk_qyem_task_18464_15=Well, it's time to say goodbye. Don't let anybody know that you're taking this.
talk_qyem_task_18464_16=All right, all right, I see, what a pain in the neck.
talk_endfight_30011=Cursed wretch!
talk_endfight_30012=Let me rest a minute before the next fight!
talk_endfight_30013=Coward! Don't run away!
talk_endfight_30014=A ha. It's my strategic retreat. You cannot understand!
talk_endfight_30015=You got lucky. I'll spare you this time.
talk_endfight_30016=If you want to fight with me, follow me to town!
talk_endfight_30017=Wonderful!
talk_endfight_30018=You are just small potatoes. I look down upon you.
talk_endfight_30019=People who violate our image and power will be killed.
talk_endfight_30020=It's a bit hard to deal with. Guys, we fight together!
talk_endfight_30507=Oh don't leave just yet. We were having fun! Let's fight again!

talk_beginfight_30025=Cursed Tartar wretch, you'll be dead!
talk_beginfight_30026=Try the knife of your Grandpa Ming!

talk_special_200008=I didn't get you!
talk_special_200009=It sees that we have clients now. Come and welcome them.

talk_special_80260712=Are you here to hurt my Lord? No, I would not let you succeed!
talk_special_50005=No. Zhuge Ying is still guarding outside. We have to defeat her first, or we can't escape.
talk_special_35035=You will regret for your action!
talk_beattacked_45590=Is that all you've got? You disappoint me.
talk_beattacked_45591=Let me show you the true meaning of might!

talk_special_30059=There are some omens that something great will happen.
talk_special_30590=Yes, army advisor.
talk_special_30591=In this case, let them go. For safety, you go ahead to show me the way.
talk_special_30592=Elder Brother Liang, I, I have been, I have been... [Weeps]... by them. Sob, I am afraid.

talk_special_30598=Sir Fang, when the flower is in blossom, you need to pick it, otherwise there will be no flowers left.
talk_special_30599=Sir Fang, the night is so short, and it is aready late. I will always remember your kindness. I am leaving now.
talk_special_8200000=You have spied on me for a long time. Is it because you want to fight with me?
talk_special_8200001=When we were in a martial arts competition, I should have drawn a circle, but I lost instead.
talk_special_8201011=Your martial arts are good, Young Hero. After seeing your performance, I want to have a duel with you. If you can beat me, I will give you the treasures I have brought.
talk_special_8201012=If you continue to run around and do not fight with me seriously, I will not fight with you.
talk_special_8201013=It is hard to tell who the winner is. Let us duel some other time.
talk_special_8201014=Ha ha, It turns out I can beat you.
talk_endfight_80010=Who would have expected that you are so weak.
talk_endfight_80011=You think too much of your martial arts ability. You are over-confident.
talk_special_19000=I have seen countless swords and forged countless swords. But none of them can help me obtain vengeance. Does the will of Heaven oppose me? If it is thus, I will oppose the will of Heaven.
talk_special_19001=I am worried there is no one to honor my new sword. Let me see whether your blood is pure enough.
talk_special_19002=I will use your blood to honor my Cross Sword Array.
talk_special_19003=You dare to meddle in my revenge. You are damned to die.

talk_special_19010=Killing you is much easier than killing an ant.
talk_special_19011=Ah!!! You gangsters actually dare provoke me. You are waiting to be killed!!!
talk_special_19012=The end of life is a pile of bones. Do not struggle any more.
talk_special_19013=Go on and scream. The loudest screaming is the most exciting.
talk_special_19014=I like your head; it can be made into a nice piece of jewelry. I will take it!
talk_special_19015=The Strange Poison "Apart Forever" is mediocre. It was no problem for me.
talk_special_19016=Ah, you are poisoned by the strange poison "Long-time lovesickness. " But do not worry, "Miss Forever" is the antidote.
talk_special_19017=No, no. Why? Why? Is it an antidote or a poison? Please do not leave me, darling.
talk_special_19018=No, no. You must have killed my darling. I will bury you with her as an offering!
talk_special_19019=Ha ha! I will immediately receive a new life.
talk_special_19020=A doctor is as kind as a parent. I would still do what is best for you even if I wanted to kill you. Please do not doubt it.
talk_special_19021=I would rather die happy than have a hard life. What do you think?
talk_special_19022=I know you have led hard lives. Go in peace—I will ensure that your souls find release.
talk_tg01_03_04=I am casual and free by nature. However, although I do not care about niceties, these things have finally caught up with me.
talk_tg02_03_03=Your skill has made great progress. Which Expert have you studied under?
talk_tg02_04_05=Perhaps because of the great gap between our martial arts, you are deliberately not using your full strength. Why don’t you just go ahead and beat me?
talk_tg03_05_02=You don't look like you're here for a simple visit. What's on your mind?
talk_tg03_08_02=I grew up in the Gold Needle Shen Family and cannot bear it when someone causes trouble here. Why have you come?
talk_tg03_08_06=I often recall my life experience. I know it is useless, but I cannot help myself from remembering it.
talk_tg03_09_01=I am Wang Tianhuai, the sworn younger brother of the Castle Lord.
talk_tg03_09_04=I like blades best, because I am like a blade myself.
talk_tg04_03_06=I do not pursue fame or riches, which are only material possessions.
talk_tg04_04_06=The position of Villa Master must be held by an experienced person. This has nothing to do with how old you are. Are you qualified to be the Villa Master, Elder Brother?
talk_tg05_04_05=I hope I can travel in Jianghu like you, and see the strange people and things.
talk_tg05_05_01=I am the Third Young Master Nangong Lie of Nangong Residence.
talk_tg05_05_04=Maybe I have a natural gift for the Martial Arts. I am fond of weapons in particular.
talk_tg05_07_01=I am Ye Cuilan, the Lady of Nangong Residence.
talk_tg05_07_02=I think your purpose in coming this time is more than just a social call.
talk_tg06_07_04=Last time I stole a Master's Script to practice, and was found out by Elder Martial Brother Chenzi. He happened to suffer an injury not long after and I treated his injury with the heart of a Snowy Monkey, so he did not report it to the Master.
talk_tg06_08_06=The legendary book that we talked about last time turned up in Lan Ji's hands. The book seems to have recorded some things little known by people. Forget it. Let's have a drink.
talk_tg10_05_02=What is your purpose in Thunderbolt Hall? Please state your intent clearly.
talk_tg10_05_04=Good and bad character has nothing to do with righteousness and evil. There are hypocrites even in righteous Sects.
talk_tg12_01_05=Come here. How about having a cup of tea with me, Young Hero?
talk_tg12_04_04=Recently a government official has often given me trouble. I wanted to bribe him, but there also happened to be an upright official who was going to arrest me. Luckily my dog helped me.
talk_tg13_02_03=Although your martial arts are better than mine, I have more money, and money can buy the devil.
talk_tg13_08_04=I seem to have hurt Su Luo'er in the arena. I have no idea whether to make an apology.
talk_tg14_01_04=Traitors have infiltrated the Youming Palace! One of them tried to kill me with hidden shrapnel!
talk_tg14_01_05=How about giving your allegiance to me, so you can attain great achievement, Young Hero?
talk_tg15_04_03=Do not fight any more, Young Hero. Go back and study to pass the official examinations.
talk_tg18_03_05=Now my skills have neared perfection. Let us compete for 300 rounds today.
talk_tg18_04_02=Dongfang Residence cares nothing about Jianghu. Do you have some information for us today?
talk_tg18_13_06=This is not my lifetime ambition. As for me, I will just stay temporarily at the Dongfang Residence.
talk_tg19_03_05=Do not be so arrogant just because you defeated me several times by chance. The Murong Family has many unique skills; I did not reveal any of my real talents.
talk_tg20_03_06=Do you know that I once tried to consult an expert in medicine? But the expert's disposition was strange and gave me advice only after purposely making a lot of trouble for me.
talk_tg25_01_04=I used Kunlun Fine Steel to make "Flame Demon and God Iron. " But although it is a sharp weapon, it is not a God weapon, and is far inferior to the Blade Demon.
talk_tg27_05_05=Your Kung Fu and flying skills are quite good. Please do not embarrass Fierce Tiger Mountain Stronghold.
talk_special_30002=Transform yourself into a dragon and wreak havoc on the enemy.
talk_special_30038=The sound of striking a body makes me feel good. I like hearing "whap. " It is a wonderful sound. Ha ha, I like it.
talk_special_30039=In fact I know it. Let me sent you back home.
talk_special_30041=Do you want to be flattened by me? I look forward to flattening you.
talk_special_30043=Ha ha, let me use the army's special skills to defeat the enemy camp.
talk_special_30044=Have you ever listened to the sound of grinding bones?
talk_special_30050=Want to escape? Leave your head here!
talk_special_30052=There is no doubt that this will be your burial ground!
talk_special_30053=Do you feel the pressure?
talk_special_30529=Go ahead. Are you going to give them the whole village just for a woman?
talk_special_30536=Barbarians and Chinese alike take advantage of me. Only Xiaocui treats me well. I am unaccomplished and only hope she can lead a happy life. I'd do anything for her and don't care who rules the country.
talk_special_30542=Army Advisor, I have heard it. It is true.
talk_special_30545=Let's deal with it here and now. You go to the back mountains and gather Defense Resources to build up our artillery, so that we can defend the city.
talk_special_30547=Ha ha, there is a saying that "There are nine frontiers in the world, and Yanmen Pass is foremost. " Now that I have conquered Yanmen Pass, let me see how powerful the Ming Army is. My followers, advance. Now that the Ming's empire has been crushed by our army, let's immediately go to Yanjing.
talk_special_80003=As long as I am alive, my hatred will never end.
talk_special_80004=There is good fate and bad fate. There is good nature and evil. What is the meaning in opposing one's nature?
talk_special_80005=Burn my demon body and dispel this absurd state. Life and death will follow my heart.
talk_special_80007=Are people good by nature? Everything is just a disguise. Human beings like gain and dislike loss by nature.
talk_special_80020211=As you can defeat me, Ye Nanzhi, your Martial Arts must be great. What is your name please?
talk_special_80040311=You are leaving so soon after defeating me, Young Master? Stop and tell me who you are.
talk_special_80050114={@0:玩家名} From now on, the Jianghu people will call you Great Hero.
talk_special_80050702=You are so ignorant. You just won by chance last time, but became so arrogant about it. Today I will show you how poor your skill is.
talk_special_80050712={@0:玩家名} There is a good apprentice among the younger generation. He has defeated me several times.
talk_special_80050713=It seems that I have to ask my juniors to compete in martial arts with you. If I compete with you, I cannot use all my strength.
talk_special_80050704={@0:玩家名} I usually give you some leeway as you are in the younger generation. Today I will use all my strength!
talk_special_80070304={@0:玩家名} As you insist on asking me to trouble the Salt Gang, I will accompany you to the end.
talk_special_80100213=I never would have expected you to have made such rapid progress in martial arts in such a short time.
talk_special_80100701=Let's skip the small talk. As we are going to have a martial arts competition, first tell me your name.
talk_special_80100711=Today you may defeat me, but I may defeat you one day. Tell me your name!
talk_special_80110302=The taste is familiar. Have you come here before? You dare to come here even though you know I have great skills? Do you want to die?
talk_special_80120402=My dog seems to recognize you. Have you come here before?
talk_special_80140401=I am A-Xiu, the Gold Sword maid. Who dares to make trouble here?
talk_special_80160511=No matter whether the Emei School put you up to it, I do not want to see you anymore.
talk_special_80170604={@0:玩家名}, as you have shown me no mercy, do not blame me for my injustice to you. My hidden weapon has been poisoned!
talk_special_80180601=Who are you and what is your name? Let me know who you are.
talk_special_80200904={@0:玩家名}, today I absolutely will not let you win.
talk_special_80210201=Who are you and what is your name? My sword is merciless. Do not force me to kill you anonymously.
talk_special_80210502=You have come in the face of dissuasion. Let me give you a lesson.
talk_special_80220713={@0:玩家名}, you will not be so lucky next time.
talk_special_80250503={@0:玩家名}, today I will catch you and torture you to death.
talk_special_80260613={@0:玩家名}, if I am defeated here, I will lose face for the Duke.
talk_special_80270213={@0:玩家名}, your skill is really excellent, Young Hero. Fierce Tiger Mountain Stronghold is not a good place and you'd better leave there. Otherwise you will die.
talk_special_80270204={@0:玩家名}, although I think highly of your courage, I am the Lady of the Stronghold and I cannot let you pass. Take that!
talk_special_80280101=Who are you and what business do you have at Baodu Stronghold? Quickly tell me your name.
talk_special_80310113=As you have no consideration for my feelings, I will show no mercy next time.
talk_special_80310204={@0:玩家名}, I think we have something in common. If you can defeat me again, you will get 10% off the entrance fee.
talk_special_80310414=Ah?! Your Kung fu is better than mine! I cannot believe it. Maybe my comfortable life all these years has led to this.
talk_special_80310501=Who are you? Tell me your name! Do not die without leaving your name.
talk_special_80321103=My thieving darling! Where are you? What did you do with her? I will kill you!
talk_beginfight_43001=Too late to run now, kid.
talk_beginfight_43002=There you are.
talk_beginfight_43003=Die!
talk_beginfight_43004=Burn it all!
talk_beginfight_43005=Where do you think YOU'RE going?

talk_free_43004=Here's another one!
talk_free_43006=Burn everything! Burn everyone!
talk_free_43007=Zhao Ziji once told us that the weak don't deserve mercy. Now he's hiding behind them. Funny, eh?

talk_free_43009=No one escapes!
talk_free_43010=Kill them all!
talk_free_43011=Do I know you?
talk_free_43012=Kill them all!

talk_free_43015=Everyone in this village will die for protecting Zhao Ziji!
talk_free_43016=The hunt is over. Finally.
talk_free_43017=We owe the Han Family a great debt.
talk_free_43020=The Han Family saved us.
talk_free_43021=Zhao Ziji deserves to suffer before he dies.
talk_free_43023=He won't get away this time.
talk_free_43024=Finally. Here he is.
talk_free_43025=The Han Family will finally have vengeance.
talk_free_43101=Zhao Ziji, I'm going to make your life miserable.
talk_free_43102=Thanks to Zhao Ziji, the proprietor is Xi Mountain Han Family this time. And we're goig to be wealthy.
talk_free_43103=Kill Zhao Ziji that crap so that I can go back to keep sleeping earlier.
talk_free_43104=Hmm, Zhao Ziji, Zhao Ziji, I'd like to see whether the god will help you this time!
talk_free_43105=Zhao Ziji, son of shrew. Back then, master died so miserably. Today I am going to treat you ten times worse than what you did to our master then.
talk_free_43106="Losers have no right to live in this world." You will be the loser today.
talk_free_43107=Zhao Ziji, Zhao Ziji, you make me uneasy. I finally find you after all these day's searching!
talk_free_43108=Take the money and serve the people. Since I have accepted the Xi Mountain Han Family's money, I certainly won't let you go. Prepare to fight!
talk_free_43109=Dont blame me for being ruthless! You should blame this on the Han Family. It’s a direct order from Mr. Han.
talk_beattacked_43001=Another one over here!
talk_beattacked_43002=I will not be defeated by you!
talk_beattacked_43003=Die!
talk_beattacked_43004=Brothers! Help me!
talk_beattacked_43005=Who ARE you?
talk_beattacked_43006=Why won't you die?
talk_beattacked_43007=Help!
talk_beattacked_43101=Wow it looks like you've really got something there! Now try these for size!
talk_beattacked_43102=You fight like a girl! Die!
talk_beattacked_43103=Give me everything you've got!
talk_beattacked_43104=Your skills are so limited. Let me show you something awesome!
talk_beattacked_43105=I didn't know you were good at this! Now we're playing for keeps!
talk_beattacked_43106=How can you pretend to be a hero with such pitiful skills! I'll tear you to pieces!
talk_beattacked_43107=Such basic kung fu! I've overestimated you.
talk_beattacked_43108=Come on, let's see what you've got! I'd like to see!
talk_beattacked_43109=Since you are here, why don't you join me for a while.
talk_beattacked_43110=Are you malnourished? Your puny hits… it's like getting punched by an earthworm!
talk_die_43001=I don't want to die!
talk_die_43002=Mercy!
talk_die_43003=It hurts!
talk_die_43004=No!
talk_die_43005=Please!
talk_die_43006=Help!
talk_die_43101=I shouldn't have got into trouble today.
talk_die_43102=How could I be defeated by a bunch of snot-nosed louts!
talk_die_43104=Just you wait! The Han Family will hunt you down!
talk_die_43105=I shouldn't have come here no matter how much they paid me!
talk_die_43106=I never expected someone would be better than me in kung fu!
talk_die_43107=I shouldn't have got into trouble today.
talk_die_43108=I don't want to die. I have a lot to live for.
talk_die_43110=Just you wait! The Han Family will hunt you down!
talk_die_43111=What's wrong with me? Why did I do those crazy things?
talk_special_8200002=Do not run! I can still fight!
talk_special_42025=Young Master Xing, the old woman who checked in together with you asked me to charge the room payment to you. This letter was left in her room after someone else picked her up.
talk_beginfight_17523=
talk_beginfight_17525=Be vigilant! None shall pass!
talk_beginfight_17526=Once you pass this gate, you shall no longer be among the living.
talk_beginfight_17527=If you pass the judgment of Shura Temple, there may be hope for you yet.
talk_beginfight_17528=Very good! Since you're here, it means those two at the Ten King Palace must be dead.
talk_beginfight_17529=I am Royal Guards' new hall leader.
talk_beginfight_17530=
talk_beginfight_17531=I will keep you here forever!
talk_beginfight_17532=Many have come for the Royal Guards Tapestry. Only the few ever made it this far.
talk_beginfight_17533=You will not pass.
talk_beginfight_17534=Good and evil cannot be judged by men. Once you enter the gate you are a ghost.
talk_beginfight_17535=If you pass the judgment of Shura Temple, you may leave to be reborn.
talk_beginfight_17536=Let me show you what I know.
talk_beginfight_17537=Don't sweat the details.
talk_beginfight_17538=I can finally show off my moves.
talk_beginfight_17539=This  fire will boil your blood dry.
talk_beginfight_17540=I will keep you here forever!
talk_beginfight_17541=Who sent you? For stealing the Tapestry and reviving the Demon Cult, your penalty is death.
talk_beginfight_33021=<font color="#ff0000">Many have come and died. You will be no exception. </font>
talk_beginfight_33022=<font color="#ff0000">Beware of kung fu experts!</font>
talk_beginfight_33023=<font color="#ff0000">I don't care why you are here, as long as you never leave.</font>
talk_beginfight_33024=<font color="#ff0000">I wonder who is spreading the rumor? If it's you, then you have no honor!</font>
talk_beginfight_33025=<font color="#ff0000">Greedy profiteers! Your only profit today is your death!</font>
talk_beginfight_33026=<font color="#ff0000">That damn Zhu Luedong got away. I guess I'll have to kill you instead.</font>
talk_beginfight_33027=<font color="#ff0000">How dare you try to rob me! Die! </font>
talk_beginfight_33028=<font color="#ff0000">Who's the boss now?  Zhu Luedong, you are the son of a dog! No one shall take what is mine!</font>
talk_beginfight_33029=<font color="#ff0000">That damn Zhu Luedong got away! We'll just have to kill our way out of here.</font>
talk_beginfight_45135=I will take this. Leave in peace.
talk_beginfight_45136=Curiosity is your downfall.
talk_beginfight_45521=Behold, Ecstasy Cave. It shall be your tomb.
talk_beginfight_45522=Trespassers! None shall pass!
talk_beginfight_45524=Grow, worms, in flame and light!
talk_beginfight_45525=When you taste my poison, you will beg for death!
talk_beginfight_45526=Feel that poison coursing through your veins. That is the slow, painful journey to your death.
talk_beginfight_45527=Corpses make good weapons.
talk_beginfight_45528=Who can get near me? Are you not worried that my flying wheel will slice your head off?
talk_beginfight_45529=I have not tasted fresh blood for so long. Let me feast on your warm blood!
talk_beginfight_45530=Do you feel my Sword Chi? On your guard!
talk_beginfight_45531=You will die in the blink of an eye.
talk_beginfight_45532=Nothingness begets nothingness. Such is the end of your meaningless existence.
talk_beginfight_45534=Haha, I will let my disciples have some fun with you. Don't hold back!
talk_beginfight_45535=Shura Temple is not somewhere you degenerates can simply enter!
talk_beginfight_39008=How dare you trespass in to forbidden instance of Ten Thousand Poison Palace. You think Tangmen just let you walk in there?
talk_beginfight_80001=Judge me again, and you'll die.
talk_beginfight_80002=If wealth does not move you, perhaps your fear of death will.
talk_beginfight_80003=I may be narrow minded, but I know what I'm good at. Killing you.
talk_beginfight_80004=There is only one rule. Kill or be killed.
talk_beginfight_80005=It's you!
talk_free_45050=The way through Ecstasy Cave is fraught with danger. Let me help you!
talk_free_45520=Watch your back! Hahaha
talk_free_45521=Back in the day when I sparred with the Buddha Guardian, he still had a lot to catch up with me. Do I even need to talk to you?
talk_free_45522=Come, show me what you've got!
talk_free_45523=Spawn, my worms! Come!
talk_free_45524=I will prove to you today that my Worm Skills are more powerful than any martial arts.
talk_free_45525=Your skills are wasted away by poison. How delightful.
talk_free_45526=Are you feeling faint? Do you feel weak? That's some good poison, wouldn't you agree?
talk_free_45527=Wake up blood corpses! Awake! To Battle!
talk_free_45528=I can smell fresh blood. Let the Blood Pond cover your body!
talk_free_45530=In thirty years, I have never met my match in Ecstasy Cave. You only have to look down at the corpses I left on the ground.
talk_free_45531=Buddha Altar is not somewhere you are allowed to go as you please!
talk_free_45532=I, the Buddha Guardian, am a master of Twin Swords. If you don't give all you've got, you will die.
talk_free_45533=How dare you come to Shura Temple! If you cannot defeat me, don't even dream about leaving.
talk_free_45534=Watch this! Hahaha, is that all you've got?
talk_free_45535=Today Shura Temple will be your tomb!
ui_npcclone019001_relive1=Let's regroup and go forward!
ui_npcclone019001_relive2=Confirm regroup and going forward!
talk_beattacked_35516=With such measly skills, how dare you come to Sacrifice Cliff?
talk_beattacked_35517=Good move, but... huh!
talk_beattacked_35518=I held back. Don't think you got away with it!
talk_beattacked_35519=Turn back. Nothing but misery awaits you.
talk_beattacked_35520=I'll show you !
talk_beattacked_35521=I'll show you no mercy!
talk_beattacked_35522=I'm old, but I'm still better than you!
talk_beattacked_35523=You're going to hell!
talk_beattacked_35524=Hehe... interesting.
talk_beattacked_35525=Is this all you can do after twenty years of training?
talk_beattacked_35526=That just won't do!
talk_beattacked_35527=Show me all you've got!
talk_beattacked_35528=I am just warming up!
talk_beattacked_35529=Is that all you've got? Show me what else you know!
talk_beattacked_39029=Hm... is that all? Show me what you really can do!
talk_beattacked_39030=How dare you come here?
talk_beattacked_39031=This is your last chance!
talk_beattacked_39032=Not bad, not bad!
talk_beattacked_39033=You vermin! You don't know what is good for you!
talk_beattacked_39034=Is that all? Let me show you some real skills!
talk_beattacked_39035=Humor me, while you still can.
talk_beattacked_39036=Today is a good day for you to die.
talk_beattacked_33019=<font color="#FF6600">Help!</font>
talk_beattacked_33020=<font color="#FF6600">Help!</font>
talk_beattacked_33022=<font color="#ff0000">You're a fool, and now you're dead.</font>
talk_beattacked_33023=<font color="#ff0000">Looks like you know a thing or two!</font>
talk_beattacked_33024=<font color="#ff0000">You can't hurt me! Die!</font>
talk_beattacked_80001=Let's do this!
talk_beattacked_80002=Hand over your money, now!
talk_beattacked_80003=Spare me your words. Fight!
talk_beattacked_80004=You want to die? Glad to help.
talk_beattacked_80005=You call yourselves friends? I'll expose your lies.
talk_die_45518=Take no step further!
talk_die_45520=How is this possible?
talk_die_45521=I was undefeated for twenty years, until today! I'm so ashamed!
talk_die_45522=Victory goes to the young this day.
talk_die_41015=Alas!
talk_die_41016=Take care!
talk_die_41017=We're here to be with you.
talk_die_41018=It's been a long time since I last saw this place.
talk_die_41019=Why do I feel so weak?
talk_die_41020=How can it end like this?
talk_die_41021=Well done. You have my respect.
talk_die_41022=So young yet so skilled... I am truly old.
talk_die_41023=How can this place be destroyed in one day?
talk_die_41024=Brothers, let us be brothers again in the next life.
talk_die_41025=I admit defeat.
talk_die_41026=You are the stronger one.
talk_die_41027=You're barbaric.
talk_die_41028=I only have myself to blame for this.
talk_die_41029=Leave, while you still can!
talk_die_41030=Defeating me means nothing. Our lord is a hundred times stronger.
talk_die_41031=Such power!
talk_die_41032=My lord, please be careful.
talk_die_41033=Young Hero, you are truly skilled. Please spare me.
talk_die_33017=<font color="#ff0000">You fools. You are being used. Death will be your only Reward. </font>
talk_die_33018=<font color="#ff0000">I've lost my life in vain...</font>
talk_die_33019=<font color="#ff0000">The traitor Zhu Luedong betrayed us! </font>
talk_die_80001=I will return someday for my revenge!
talk_die_80002=Take the damn money! I'll get it back one day.
talk_die_80003=Victory is yours today. Until next time!
talk_die_80004=Coward, you only know to follow rules blindly.
talk_die_80005=No! I'd rather die than to admit you're better than me!
talk_special_19023=Blood will be repaid by blood.
talk_special_19024=Be gone, vermin!
talk_special_19025=Come closer and feel my blade.
talk_special_19026=Your attacks cannot stop me.
talk_special_19027=Fleeing from your crimes only makes you all the more guilty!
talk_special_19028=Behold, the power of the storm!
talk_special_19029=Disrespect me, and my sword will treat you in kind.
talk_special_19030=You will not be able to move even a step.
talk_special_19031=Let the wings of eagles sweep you off your feet!
talk_special_19032=I will feast on your blood.
talk_special_19033=Laozi went West. The Aura comes from the East.
talk_special_19034=My swordsmanship has no equal. You'd be honored to die by my hands.
talk_special_19035=Just relax, and do whatever you want.
talk_special_19036=Go to hell!
talk_special_19037=Behold, Yin and Yang are reversed.
talk_special_19038=Old fool, let me heal you!
talk_special_19039=How will you bring your people back now?
talk_special_19040=Your death awaits!
talk_special_19041=Haha, a mere spark can burn down an entire forest.
talk_special_19042=Go away, all of you!
talk_special_19043=Fire! Run away if you can!
talk_special_19044=This is my turf.
talk_special_19045=This is the sharp end of my blade. It will soon be stained with your blood.
talk_special_19046=You're just the one I've been looking for.
talk_special_70010=We're here.
talk_special_70012=Please advise.
talk_special_70021=Sir, why are you in this freezing ice cellar?
talk_special_70023=…
talk_special_70027=Sir, can Master Xuanzhen really beat you in just three moves?
talk_special_70030=We cannot abandon him. We need to restrain his inner Yang Chi.
talk_special_70062=Thank you for your help. Please accept this as my thanks.
talk_special_70063=Greetings, sir. I have always wanted to learn the Wudang skills for the palm, fist and sword. Will you teach me?
talk_special_70064=Wudang has sent people to stop you. Defeat them.
talk_special_70065=Please follow me, around us are the eight gates of "rest, birth, injury, stop, view, death, shock, and open." You need to defeat the gates of "life" and "open" and leave the other 6 gates.
talk_special_70066=The Sheng (Birth) Gate is at Gen. The Death Gate is at Kun. Birth and Death are opposites; Gen and Kun are at odds. Only by getting through death gate then can there be a chance at breaking through the "Eight Gate Life Death Array." Inside the death gate can be found the "magnetic ore" used for making medicinal pills. Make sure to collect some.
talk_special_70067=The Shang (Injury) Gate is at Zhen. The chances of injury increase when you do not follow the patterns of nature. Move when necessary. Stop when necessary. Incorporate motion and lack of motion and break through the array.
talk_special_70068=The Xiu (Rest) Gate is at Kan. The source of the cold wind is the place where the breath of life is cultivated. However, it is the opposite for us, so be careful.
talk_special_70069=The Du (Stop) Gate is at Kun. When blocking the gate from opening, it is difficult to find the direction, and the way is unclear. Stay on your path, and do not become distracted.
talk_special_70071=The Jing (Shock) Gate is at Dui. Dui is the Marsh. It can mean shortage or it can mean damage. This is the last gate. Please take care, one wrong step and all is lost.
talk_special_70072=Elder, we are here to get through Jin gate so we can challenge Taoist Xuanzhen.
talk_special_70073=Our master is in meditation. I am afraid he will not be able to fight you now. How about you fight me instead?
talk_special_70074=You are indeed skilled. I am defeated. If you insist on seeing master. I will not stop you. The key to master's meditation chamber is here. Please take it.
talk_special_70075=Damn you! How did you defeat my mechanical man?
talk_special_70076=No... I have been defeated. I am too old. You can go.
talk_special_70077=We have successfully gotten through the 6 gates.
talk_special_70078=You are indeed talented. I am truly impressed.
talk_special_70079=We couldn't have done it without your help!
talk_special_70080=if you are not skilled enough, you simply will not be able to get through.
talk_special_70081=Sir, we have heard that an important artifact is hidden here, and that it concerns the Demon Cult. Is this true?
talk_special_70082=It is better if you do not ask about the Demon Cult, or else trouble might follow. Please remember not to mention this to anyone else.
talk_special_70083=Sir, please rest assured, We are only here for the challenge, we will not mention this to the others.
talk_special_70084=If you are here to spar, I will not say no. Come and let's see what you have got.
talk_special_70085=You've won. Now leave.
talk_special_70086=Thank you for saving my life. I will forever be grateful.
talk_special_70087=Who are you? Why are you here?
talk_special_70088=I am Zhu Luedong. I know a little about the "Eight Gate Array of Life and Death." Let me tell you what I know as my way of thanking you, for saving my life.
talk_special_70089=Lead the way, Brother Zhu.
talk_special_70090=Follow me.
talk_special_70091=Stop, you thieves!
talk_special_70092=Have you heard of me? I am Taoist Wuwei. I'm surprised you've made it this far.
talk_special_70093=You thieves have some nerve! Taste My Seven Star Sword!
talk_special_70094=Trespassers! You will answer for your crimes!
talk_special_70095=Damn you! You broke my mechanical man! You will pay!
talk_special_70096=You, at the front! Don't get wet now!
talk_special_70097=You, at the back! You can't hide!
talk_special_70098=The Shang (Injury) Gate is at Zhen. The chances of injury increase when you do not follow the patterns of nature. Have you forgotten all that you've learned?
talk_special_70099=So cold! Come closer!
talk_special_70100=Too hot! Get away!
talk_special_70101=Did you think your defense is impenetrable?
talk_special_70102=Let me see if you truly understand this basic sword skill.
talk_special_70103=Let me see which of you does not know how to protect your group. Let him bring you all to defeat!
talk_special_70104=Watch closely. Let me show you what it's really like to fight all alone!
talk_special_70105=I will make you shed your armors!
talk_special_70106=Who do you think you are, vermin?
talk_special_70107=You are nothing!
talk_special_70108=Whenever I see such beautiful scenery, I  ponder upon my fleeting existence.
talk_special_70109=My energy is limitless!
talk_special_70112=I won't forget…
talk_special_70113=I, Sang Shuyun, will not be stopped!
talk_special_70114=I will bury you all today!
talk_special_70115=Don't disappoint me!
talk_special_70116=Haha, not bad! Again!
talk_special_70117=So you can't fly, but can't you even walk?
talk_special_70118=You will sink deep into this cold pool, if you don't stop me!
talk_special_70119=Stop me if you can!
talk_special_70120=Try again!
talk_special_70121=Let's see how this Golden Pill works.
talk_special_70122=How does it feel, being hit in the back?
talk_special_70123=Get over here!
talk_special_70124=All the secret skills of mechanisms are hidden in this Eight Diagrams Painting. Please take it as my greeting gift.
talk_special_70125=Not one of you will get away!
talk_special_70126=Should we keep going?
talk_special_70127=I will see you leave here safely, my friend.
talk_special_70128=For someone who has delved into the mysteries of Yin Yang, life and death means nothing.
talk_special_70129=Do not move, or you will hurt not only to yourself, but others as well.
talk_special_70130=Under the force of the Great Door, all will perish.
talk_special_70131=Everything is in my hands!
talk_special_35117=What boastful words, you think you can defeat me with that?
talk_special_35118=Amitabha!
talk_special_35119=Brothers, let's go!
talk_special_35120=You are asking to die!
talk_special_35121=You do not deserve the Jiuyin Zhenjing Manual.
talk_special_35122=You will die today.
talk_special_35123=Guards, we have an intruder!
talk_special_35124=Sisters, we will protect Meiyan Tower.
talk_special_35125=My advice to you is to put down your weapons, and turn back.
talk_special_35126=Who dares to enter Emei forbidden instance! If you insist on going forward, we will not hold back. Emei disciples, prepare the Lotus Array!
talk_special_35127=Without the command of our grandmaster, no one will pass Zhengyun Tower, unless you kill me Zhao Yuchun first!
talk_special_35128=Who are you? I will let our grandmaster decide how to deal with you!
talk_special_35129=The library of the Sacrifice cliff is a forbidden instance. Leave now if you have no business here!
talk_special_35130=Mount these horses and talk with me. I can send you off to Cloud Terrace!
talk_special_35131=Mount these horses and talk with me. I can send you off to Cloud Terrace!
talk_special_35132=Mount these horses and talk with me. I can send you off to Cloud Terrace!
talk_special_35133=Mount these horses and talk with me. I can send you off to Cloud Terrace!
talk_special_35135=Turn back now…ahead is nothing but misery…
talk_special_35136=You…
talk_special_35137=I waited at the library for half my life, for this?
talk_special_35138=My love, I am coming to join you.
talk_special_35139=I go, like the flow of the Yangtze, never to return.
talk_special_35140=Even if I die, I will not let you have what you want!
talk_special_35141=Amitabha!
talk_special_35142=My advice to you is to put down your weapons, and turn back.
talk_special_35143=Don't throw your life away, like you're about to.
talk_special_35144=You broke through my Green Lake Lotus Mist! Good! Let me see what else you've got!
talk_special_35145=Trespassers! I will show you no mercy!
talk_special_35146=While you're hiding in this library, I've been outside killing thieves!
talk_special_35147=It's too late now for you to change your mind! If you want to live a better life, wait for your next life!
talk_special_35148=You troublemaker! You won't leave here alive!
talk_special_35149=Here come another group looking for death.
talk_special_35150=Mieyuan, how could you!?
talk_special_35151=I have been trapped for over twenty years. Let me see what you children have got!
talk_special_35152=Warrior Xie, I see you have indeed forsaken your title of first blade master twenty years ago. Now you can barely spar with children!
talk_special_35153=Today is a good day for you to die.
talk_special_35154=Please wait!
talk_special_35155=You are indeed skilled.
talk_special_35156=Juekong does not have the treasure?
talk_special_35157=The flowers wither, the shadows flee.
talk_special_35159=As the rainbow fades, so do my foes under my blade
talk_special_35160=Three thousand silver needles will put you into a coma for nine days.
talk_special_35161=What is all this about?
talk_special_35162=You will meet your doom here.
talk_special_35163=There is a time to live, and a time to die.
talk_special_35164=The dead do not rise.
talk_special_35165=With strength, even a dragon can be subdued with bare hands.
talk_special_35166=You are not meant to be.
talk_special_35167=You do not see the whole picture here.
talk_special_35168=You reap what you sow.
talk_special_35169=Go where the shadows go, where there is no light.
talk_special_35170=Your beauty may fade with age, but your love remains in your heart.
talk_special_35171=Love will come for you many times, and leave just as often.
talk_special_35172=Grief becomes you.
talk_special_35173=Truth is in the eye of the beholder.
talk_special_35174=Death comes to us all.
talk_special_35175=At the end of night is a new day.
talk_special_35176=Sometimes the best action is inaction.

talk_die_45130=Brother, don't hurt me. I was only joking with you!
talk_die_45131=Kill me and you will never get past Lord Corpse.
talk_die_48015=I was unexpectedly defeated by several younger Jianghu people. It seems that I am really old.
talk_die_48016=My bones really have given out after being trapped for so long.
talk_die_39102=I cannot believe I died by your hands!
talk_die_39103=I will haunt you as a ghost!
talk_die_39104=Master, I will repay your kindness in the next life.
talk_die_39105=I am not married yet. I don't want to die.
talk_die_39106=Even if you kill me, you will not leave alive.
talk_die_39107=I will be waiting for you in hell!
talk_die_39108=I don't want to die!
talk_die_39109=My death will have been in vain.
talk_die_39110=Mother, I will no longer be able to look after you!
talk_die_39111=Please!
talk_die_39112=I don't want to become fertilizer.
talk_die_39113=I will get a pay raise in a few months. I don’t want to die.
talk_die_39114=Every day is spent making medicine, now,
talk_die_39115=I have not yet completed my ultimate poison.
talk_die_39116=Master... save me.
talk_die_39117=My brothers will not let you get away with this!
talk_die_39118=First Lady... I will not be able to serve you anymore.
talk_die_39119=Ah... I... have not yet married.
talk_die_39120=How could you be so heartless to a girl?
talk_die_39121=Don't... don't hurt my face.
talk_die_39123=I can't believe you killed me, I will not accept it!
talk_die_39124=No, I can't accept it.
talk_die_39125=Even if I die, you will not get your way.
talk_die_39126=Don't you feel any remorse killing such a pretty girl as me?
talk_die_39127=Grandmother, I will not be able to serve you anymore.
talk_die_39128=I can't accept this.
talk_special_70001=The Sheng (Birth) Gate is at Gen. The Death Gate is at Kun. Birth and Death are opposites; Gen and Kun are at odds. Go through the death gate first. Deep inside the gate there is a rock. Break the rock to pass through the gate to prove that you have the skills to break through the "Eight Gate Life Death Array"!
talk_special_70011=No need for chatter. Get past me to get through rest gate!
talk_special_70013=Wudang's palm, sword and fist are famous throughout the land. Our disciples will train hard in one of them, but few ask about flying skills. If you cannot follow your opponent, it does not matter how skilled your sword or fist is, you can only defend.
talk_special_70014=Today, I will test your flying skills. If you fall of this platform, go back and train harder for a few more years.
talk_special_70015=You are impressive. This chest contains the treasures I accumulated in my youth. There are some fine items in there. Take them all.
talk_special_70020=Hey, someone is coming. I have been sitting here idly for so many years. I'm bored to death. Finally somebody to talk to, hehe.
talk_special_70022=This is a long story. Ah... too hot... too hot.
talk_special_70024=I was really proud in my youth. I thought I had great skills and believed that I would be unrivalled. But my elder brothers were better than me in fist, sword and palm. I was naturally unhappy about this.
talk_special_70025=One day, I had a sudden revelation. I lost to my elder brothers with my technique. Yet, if I trained my internal skills, the force behind my techniques would naturally increase. My elder brothers then will be no match for me. My elder brother's Chunyang Skill was already at Level 20, so I decided to train to Level 25.
talk_special_70026=I concentrated on nothing but my Chunyang Skill. In just over a year, I achieved level 25. Once my internal skills were set, I went to challenge my elder brother. After three moves, my Chi became diverted and I collapsed. If it was not for my elder brother who went to ask my master for help, I would have been dead. Ah... too hot... too hot.
talk_special_70060=This is the school challenge. I will not go easy on you. Younger brother please be careful.
talk_special_10052=I will kill you all!
talk_special_35088=Very good. You have reached the skill level of Emei disciples ready for testing.
talk_special_35112=This is Emei's meditation ground. Who are you? Leave now and you will leave unscathed!
talk_special_35113=I never knew Emei had such delicious girls, hehehe.
talk_special_35114=Stop your babbling! You don’t appear to be an upright person. Block my moves!
talk_special_35115=Little girl, come.
talk_special_35116=Amitabha, those who follow Buddha are merciful. Leave now so I am not forced to hurt you.
talk_special_45057=Help! Help me! Let me out! Open the door!
talk_special_45092=I admire you for your courage, but you are too weak. Even if you are able to leave, you will not be able to aid Shan Chong in avenging the desolation of his family.
talk_special_45110=I have waited for you for a long time. Let's discuss this quickly. Once we get past Shura Temple, I can leave and avenge my father's death. Let's go!
talk_special_80001=Do not be too serious or persistent. Do not pursue but do not stand still. You have done well!
talk_special_80006=Come to me. I am the embodiment of the kindness in your heart.
talk_special_80009=One mundane thought contains all the good and evil essence of the three thousand worlds. When the Possession comes, it is uncertain, strong and weak. Concentrate on dealing with it, and I will give you instructions.
talk_special_80012=You and I come from the same source. Do not make unnecessary moves. You cannot get to me.
talk_endfight_39001=Your martial arts skills are useless before me, Hundred Flower Duji
talk_endfight_39002=Am I doing this wrong? Useless! I have not yet finished testing my poison!
talk_endfight_39003=You will pay the price for trespassing Ten Thousand Poison Palace
talk_endfight_39004=I thought you were stronger, but you are all useless!
talk_endfight_39005=Fool! You overestimated yourself! How dare you come cause trouble for Tang Family Castle!
talk_endfight_39006=Train harder in your next life! You cannot just go in and out of Fuxuan House as you please!
talk_endfight_39007=I told you already to leave when you had the chance.
talk_endfight_39008=You can't even defeat one woman. You are all useless!
talk_endfight_39009=Are all the young people these days so useless?
talk_endfight_39010=I haven't killed in a long time.
talk_endfight_39011=Tang Family Castle will soon be mine! You ants dare try to stop me?
talk_endfight_39012=Hahaha! You defy me? Then die! I, Tang Qing, will soon take over and rule all! Hahaha!
talk_endfight_39013=Die! Die! I will kill all living things in Tang Family Castle!
talk_endfight_39014=Jus the few of you are not enough to satisfy my hatred! Tang Feng, I will turn you into dust!
talk_endfight_39101=Is this person born in the year of the rabbit? He ran away pretty fast!
talk_endfight_39102=If I see you again I will break your legs!
talk_endfight_39103=You might have escaped now, but you will not escape again!
talk_endfight_39104=You have the guts to come but not the guts to fight me?
talk_endfight_39105=You run when you see me coming, I am truly powerful. Hahaha!
talk_endfight_39106=If it wasn't because of my feet getting numb. You'd be dead!
talk_endfight_39107=Brothers, drag him out and feed him to our pets!
talk_endfight_39108=You dare come to Ten Thousand Poison Palace? This is what you deserve!
talk_endfight_39109=I didn't know you were in such a rush to die! Hahaha!
talk_endfight_39110=Go against Tang Family Castle and die!
talk_endfight_39111=Nothing wrong with you but you insist on becoming compost!
talk_endfight_39112=You have such soft-looking skin. It would be such a waste feeding you to the scorpions!
talk_endfight_39113=You can't even defeat a worker, and you have the guts to run?
talk_endfight_39114=You shouldn't have come if you can't handle it! Sorry for disturbing your work!
talk_endfight_39115=Brothers, stop chasing him. The meal is not yet done!
talk_endfight_39116=Hahaha, it appears that chopping firewood was not a waste after all!
talk_endfight_39117=When did I get so good?
talk_endfight_39118=I told you already that those of the Ten Thousand Poison Palace are not easy to tease! See, you are going to die!
talk_endfight_39119=Stop running! If you come try the poisons, I will let you go!
talk_endfight_39120=He ran away! I still have a few poisons that I want to test!
talk_endfight_39121=Now you how good I am! Hahaha!
talk_endfight_39122=Don't run away! If you go who would I test my poison on?
talk_endfight_39123=I did not realize I'm not only skilled in making poison but also have great potential for martial arts!
talk_endfight_39124=What a pity. If I had held back just now, I would have someone to test the poison on!
talk_endfight_39125=Well, they can't fight so they probably won't be very good test subjects!
talk_endfight_39126=Don't think I will let you go just because you are dead! Brothers, take him back for dissection!
talk_endfight_39127=Don't go! We only exchanged a few moves!
talk_endfight_39128=Haha, only cowards run before action!
talk_endfight_39129=Can't even beat a girl? How shameful!
talk_endfight_39130=Don't go! Let's fight!
talk_endfight_39131=I didn't know you were so weak! You can't even defeat a servant girl!
talk_endfight_39132=Ah! You died so easily! No fun!
talk_endfight_39133=You appear to be quite strong, yet somehow you cannot fight.
talk_endfight_39134=Are you dead? Ah... I am too skilled. What if I can't get married?
talk_endfight_39135=Damn, how could it have died here!? So heavy, I can't move it by myself.
talk_endfight_39136=Tell someone to carry out the corpse!
talk_endfight_39137=My precious pets will have something to eat!
talk_beattacked_30005=Who cares about this wound?!
talk_beginfight_30500=With me here, you'll all die.
talk_beginfight_30002=All will be killed!
talk_special_30034=I love the red blood spurting out when I behead the prisoners. The bright red world is so pretty! I love blood and I want more of it!
talk_die_30501=I didn't finish my great plan…
talk_beattacked_30006=I'll not admit failure!
talk_special_70058=This is the underground of Zixiao Hall, where all the experts from Wudang cultivated Tao from meditation. You can see there are eight gates, Stop Gate, Life Gate, Injury Gate, Du Gate, Blood Gate, Death Gate, Shock Gate, and Kai Gate. The way to complete your apprenticeship is to break through the "Eight Gates of Life-and-Death Array". We enter through the Kai Gate, and you have to pass through 6 gates before leaving through the Life Gate.
talk_special_70002=The Shang (Injury) Gate is at Zhen. The chances of injury increase when you do not follow the patterns of nature. Move when necessary. Stop when necessary. Incorporate motion and lack of motion and break through the array.
talk_special_70003=The Xiu (Resting) Gate is at Kan. The source of the cold wind is the place where the breath of life is cultivated. However, it is the opposite for us, so be careful.
talk_special_70004=The Du (Clumsy) Gate is at Kun. When blocking the gate from opening, it is difficult to find the direction, and the way is unclear. Would you be able to the right path?
talk_special_70005=The Jin Gate is at Li. The scene is full of blood red light like a sunrise when all life is silent. Good fortune brings with it heavy warfare, so everyone must stay alert.
talk_special_70006=The Jing (Surprise) Gate is at Dui. Dui is the Marsh. It can mean shortage or it can mean damage. This is the last gate. Please take care,  one wrong step and all is lost.
talk_special_70007=You pass all 6 gates, follow me to open the Life Gate.
talk_special_70008=A useless bunch, so now I have to join the fight.
talk_special_70009=Ah!
talk_special_70042=Soul
talk_special_70043=Demon
talk_special_70044=Array
talk_beginfight_30508=If one man guards the pass, ten thousands are unable to get through!

talk_die_37001=My grand scheme is far greater than this…
talk_die_37002=Master, I'll follow you even in death.
talk_die_37003=I've never lost, yet I failed here…
talk_die_37004=My son, I miss you.
talk_die_37005=So one day the catcher will be catched.
talk_die_37006=Let me see the world one more time…
talk_die_37007=Oh…
talk_die_37008=Don't worry about me, leave now!
talk_die_37009=Dispicable, you dare to sneak attack me.
talk_die_37010=You are going to win…
talk_die_37011=I'm going to die soon…
talk_die_37012=I'm still too young…
talk_die_37013=Ah.

talk_beginfight_17009=If you want to kill our general, you have to pass me first!
talk_beginfight_17502=I've defeated plenty of people with much better skills than you, prepare to die.
talk_beginfight_17519=As long as I'm around, you'll not touch General Ding!
talk_die_17024=I should not have worked for the government!
talk_free_17021=Yue Zhipeng actually dare to challenge the Chamber Lord, he is looking for his death!
talk_free_17022=Wait and see, the Shen Father and Son will not live for long!
talk_free_17025=Are you looking for your own death?!
talk_free_17508=I can die but I wll not bow to eunuchs! Those eunuchs want to fight to death. May my ancestors protect me to pass this safely.
talk_free_17517=The first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty left the order: Eunuchs can't participate in politics. These eunuchs have confused the current government, one day the Emperor will bring them to justice!
talk_special_80008=Hold on a moment and let me speak…
talk_special_80010=With death sword and soft chi, I'm sending you to the abyss.
talk_special_80011=Idiot,  your chance for repentance is long gone. So just sit there and sob away,  why don't you!

talk_free_33036=<font color="#ff0000">A few days ago, we went to Longnan Village to capture thieves. Through our fighting, I realize even though we are better at palm skills, those thieves run too fast and we can't capture them.</font>
talk_endfight_33011=<font color="#ff0000">At least we didn't interrupt the elders' cultivation.</font>
talk_free_33027=<font color="#ff0000">Chop! Chop! Stab! Stab!</font>

talk_endfight_33017=<font color="#ff0000">Elder Martial Brother, you're so great!</font>
talk_free_33034=<font color="#ff0000">Elder Martial Brother，your Pure Yang Sword Skill is quite advance already. You probably can learn Tai Chi Sword Skill soon.</font>
talk_free_33039=<font color="#ff0000">Even though Wudang splits skills to Chi and Sword, but I think cultivating both at the same time is the best.</font>
talk_free_33015=<font color="#ff0000">Great!</font>
talk_free_33018=<font color="#ff0000">Hmmm...</font>
talk_free_33053=<font color="#ff0000">How come Elder Martial Sister did not come today?</font>
talk_free_33020=<font color="#ff0000">I hate staying at this dark and gloomy underground place!</font>
talk_free_33085=<font color="#ff0000">I heard from Elder Martial Brother that Wudang's experts all came here to cultivate and left many wushu scripts. Don't know if I'll get a chance to learn some!</font>
talk_free_33038=<font color="#ff0000">I heard the "Cyan Face Beast" came to challenge us, and Martial Uncle Xiang defeated him in nine moves.</font>
talk_free_33033=<font color="#ff0000">I heard the Elders in cultivation will finish soon, and they comprehend a very powerful wushu skill while cultivating.</font>

talk_free_33052=<font color="#ff0000">I miss my mother...</font>
talk_free_33017=<font color="#ff0000">I want to show my moves in front of Shifu so he can see my talent!</font>
talk_endfight_33009=<font color="#ff0000">I wonder if younger martial sister sees my handsome moves?!</font>
talk_free_33029=<font color="#ff0000">I-Ching has yin and yang. Taichi is Tao.</font>
talk_endfight_33003=<font color="#ff0000">If I continue for some time, I can create the Wudang Plowing Skill!</font>

talk_free_33001=<font color="#ff0000">I'm so hungry, when are we going to eat?!</font>
talk_free_33006=<font color="#ff0000">I'm so jealous of those Elder Martial Brothers and Sister who can cultivate swords!</font>
talk_free_33019=<font color="#ff0000">It's annoying looking at these idiots daily!</font>
talk_free_33021=<font color="#ff0000">I've been digging stones here for so long, I wonder if Shifu still remembers me!</font>
talk_free_33005=<font color="#ff0000">Just because I broke a vase, Shifu sends me to dig stones for a whole year!</font>
talk_endfight_33002=<font color="#ff0000">Just because someone holds a plow, doesn't mean he is a farmer.</font>
talk_free_33007=<font color="#ff0000">Mining is even more tiring then practicing skills.</font>
talk_endfight_33001=<font color="#ff0000">My Kung Fu did improve from mining rocks and cultivating.</font>
talk_free_33059=<font color="#ff0000">Practice hard and don't be lazy!</font>
talk_endfight_33008=<font color="#ff0000">Quick, don't let them run away!</font>
talk_free_33037=<font color="#ff0000">Shhhh…You can eat whatever you want, but don't say whatever you feel like.</font>
talk_free_33051=<font color="#ff0000">Shifu always dispatch me to sweep, so unfair! Elder Martial Sister is better.</font>
talk_free_33016=<font color="#ff0000">Shifu does not teach us swords, so I created my own Plow Skill!</font>
talk_free_33054=<font color="#ff0000">Shifu is too strict. He sends me to sweep here for one month just because I dozed off!</font>
talk_free_33012=<font color="#ff0000">Shifu still needs more magnetic stones. Everyone shall work faster!</font>
talk_free_33061=<font color="#ff0000">Shifu will come to inspect soon, everyone pays attention!</font>
talk_endfight_33004=<font color="#ff0000">So quick! I didn't even finish using one single set!</font>

talk_free_33041=<font color="#ff0000">The four sages of Wudang are all cultivating within here to search for ways to rebuild Wudang.</font>
talk_free_33040=<font color="#ff0000">The last time Wudang and Wanderer's Valley fight was 9 years ago. Wudang is running out of fresh talent so I should practice even harder to rebuild Wudang.</font>

talk_free_37068=Maybe someone is using Beggars' Sect name to create trouble in Jianghu, so Elder Xu summons all of us to solve this issue.
talk_free_37069=Beggars' Sect did not host a conference for a long time. Something major will happen.
talk_free_37070=During the Beggars' Sect Conference, don't talk and let the Elders decide what to do.

talk_free_37108=Ever since the Beggars' Sect Conference was held, Elder Xu is always unhappy. I wonder what happened?
talk_free_37109=Quan Zhixing worked with Mongolians to destroy us Beggars' Sect. Fortunately, the 5 Helmsleaders worked together to defeat the Young Rajah, or else the results would be unimaginable.
talk_free_37110=I feel that my internal force is so full.
talk_free_37111=Sect Leader gave us such important task, we'll for sure try our best.
talk_free_37112=My Holding Flower Fingers restrains your stick skills, within 10 moves, you shall be defeated, we can bet.
talk_free_37113=Beggars' Sect wushu skills focus on internal force with simple moves. Your action looks like a circus acrobat.
talk_free_37114=Something strange is happening around us.
talk_free_37115=What is hidden in this Forbidden Instance? Why did Sect Leader sent so many people to guard it?
talk_free_37116=I can sense the killing will in the air.

talk_free_37126=After this patrol, would there be any drumsticks left?
talk_free_37127=Even though the Emperor eats better than we do, he doesn't get to live as freely as we do.
talk_free_37128=This yellow dog is so fat, I want to kill it and make a dish.
talk_free_37129=I don't think the Forbidden Instance includes any special script. Most likely Sect Leader Xiao hid a beautiful girl within it.
talk_free_37130=The Forbidden instance must include the recipe for Beggar's Chicken, to me that is priceless.

talk_special_41111=You want to run away?
talk_special_42030=The medicine is ready. Young Hero, take it and go save a life!
talk_special_45250=Are you Shan Er?
talk_special_45251=Oh, sorry I thought you were someone else…please forgive me for my rudeness. Young Hero, please leave, I would like some time alone.
talk_special_45252=A heroine named Yue Lingshan asked me to give this paper butterfly to someone named Ling Guchong. If you ask me to leave, I will have to tell Miss Yue that you don't need it.
talk_special_45253=Young Hero, please wait! Have you seen Shan Er? How is she?
talk_special_45254=She is not good at all! She seemed dazed when she found me, and then she told me a story in a dazed manner. All I know is that she waited for a bastard her whole life while that bastard was playing around with other women the whole time.
talk_special_45255=That right, If it wasn't for a bastard like me, she wouldn't have been...
talk_special_45256=What happened to you guys? Didn't you already get engaged by yourselves in the Tiger Forest? Why are you now ...
talk_special_45257=Back then, the girl kidnapper Lin Muzi committed many crimes, making the people of the Central Plains very scared. As one of the moral Schools in the Central Plains that upholds justice, the Head of the Wudang School sent me and Shan Er to go catch the girl kidnapper Lin Muzi.
talk_special_45258=Therefore, I thought of a method, which was to have Shan Er pretend to be a tourist girl in order to get Lin Muzi to show himself. Lin Muzi indeed took the bait. We originally thought that with the two of us against one of him, we would be able to capture Lin Muzi. Little did we know that his Flying Skills were so good.
talk_special_45259=This guy really is the scum of Wulin. How did you get Miss Yue out?
talk_special_45260=I chased them to Xuanyin Cave and found Lin Muzi just about to take his clothes off and Shan Er unconscious at one side. Shan Er was already partly undressed. I attacked that scum of Wulin with my sword and forced him to back away from Shan Er's side. Lin Muzi wasn't about to let me ruin a good thing for him and started to attack me.
talk_special_45261=This type of scum should be cut with a thousand knives and then pulled apart by horses. Is this the reason why you split up?
talk_special_45262=Afterward, we both went back to Wudang. Shan Er started avoiding me and I knew it was because she hated me for using her as bait. I also knew that I had failed her. I am not good enough for her! I am not good enough for her! After that, we both left Wudang and faced Jianghu alone.
talk_special_45263=It seems that there may be some misunderstanding between you two. I have a paper butterfly made by Miss Yue herself.
talk_special_45264=But Lin Muzi is a very difficult person to track. We had to exert a lot of effort before we were able to learn that Lin Muzi was going to show up in Suzhou. We both went to Suzhou and stayed there for several nights, but Lin Muzi was nowhere to be seen.
talk_special_45265=He first attacked Shan Er's Yindu Acupoint and then knocked Shan Er out with one strike. He then took Shan Er, who was unconscious and flew several miles into the night. I was extremely regretful and extremely anxious. I tracked them through the night by only a faint memory of the scent on Shan Er's body.
talk_special_45267=But how could I ever let her go from my mind? She is the only woman I have ever loved! I still remember, when she gave me the paper butterfly, her eyes told me that she knew I was the one and that she would marry no one but me. I felt the exact same way, and would not marry anyone but her in this lifetime. It is a pity that we were never meant to be.
talk_special_45268=???
talk_special_45270=Brother Chong, is it you?
talk_special_45271=???
talk_special_45272=Oh, sorry I thought you were someone else…please forgive me for my rudeness. Miss, please leave, I would like some time alone.
talk_special_45273=A young hero named Ling Guchong asked me to give this portrait to someone named Yue Lingshan, but since you are telling me to go, I will have to just tell the young hero that Heroine Yue does not need it anymore.
talk_special_45274=Miss, please wait! Have you seen Brother Chong? How is he?
talk_special_45275=He is not good at all! He seemed dazed when he found me, and then he told me a story in a dazed manner. All I know is that he waited for a bastard his whole life while that bastard disappeared the whole time.
talk_special_45276=Ah, this bastard no longer deserves to be with him...
talk_special_45277=What happen to the two of you? I thought you guys already promised to marry each other already, what happened now?
talk_special_45278=Back then, the girl kidnapper Lin Muzi committed many crimes, making the people of the Central Plains very scared. As one of the moral Schools in the Central Plains that upholds justice, the Head of the Wudang School sent me and Brother Chong to go catch the girl kidnapper Lin Muzi.
talk_special_45279=Lin Muzhi's path was hard to track. We investigated for several days before hearing that he's in Suzhou. We waited in Suzhou for a few days yet he still didn't show up.
talk_special_45280=Therefore, Brother Chong thought of a method, which was to have me pretend to be a tourist girl in order to get Lin Muzi to show himself. Lin Muzi indeed took the bait. We originally thought that with the two of us against one of him, we would be able to capture Lin Muzi. Little did we know that his Flying Skills were so good.
talk_special_45281=He first attacked my Yindu Acupoint and then knocked me out with one strike. He then took me, unconscious at the time, and flew several miles into the night. Brother Chong was extremely regretful and extremely anxious. He tracked us through the night by only a faint memory of the scent on my body.
talk_special_45282=This guy really is a scum of Wulin. How did young master Ling get you out?
talk_special_45283=Brother Chong chased us to Xuanyin Cave and found Lin Muzi just about to take his clothes off as well as me unconscious at one side. I had already been partly undressed. Brother Chong attacked that scum of Wulin with his sword and forced him to back away from my side. Lin Muzi wasn't about to let Brother Chong ruin a good thing for him and started to attack Brother Chong.
talk_special_45285=Lin Muzhi should be tortured and killed hundred times. You guys split because of this?
talk_special_45286=Afterward, we both went back to Wudang. I started avoiding Brother Chong partially because I felt that I was always slowing him down. But the main reason was because I was no longer clean and pure. I was not good enough for him! I did not deserve him! After that, we both left Wudang and faced Jianghu alone.
talk_special_45287=But how could I ever let him go from my mind? He is the only man I have ever loved! I still remember, when he gave me the portrait, his eyes told me that he knew I was the one and that he would marry no one but me. I felt the exact same way, and would not marry anyone but him in this lifetime. It is a pity that we were never meant to be.
talk_special_45288=It seems that there may be some misunderstanding between you two. I have the portrait drawn by young master Ling himself.
talk_special_45290=It was me who put Shan Er in that position. There is no way she will forgive me!
talk_special_45291=So many years have passed, she probably doesn't even remember me!
talk_special_45295=I am no longer a clean and pure person, Brother Chong will no longer like me.
talk_special_45296=It has been so many years. He probably doesn't even remember me!
talk_special_45300=Thank you.
talk_special_45301=Thank you.

talk_special_city03war003=You are...? Ahh, Ling Yunyu! Men, capture him!
talk_special_city03war004=No one can save you. This is for Jin Er!
talk_special_city03war005=Ahh, your majesty!
talk_special_city03war006=Empress, hurry and move away. You are Jin Er's elder sister, I cannot harm you!

talk_special_city03war008=The dignified emperor of a country needs protection from a woman, ha ha ha! Let us see what the world thinks of you from now on!
talk_special_city03war009=If this gets out, how will I retain my place as emperor! Let me fight him to the death! Empress, move out of the way!
talk_special_city03war010=Alright, for Jin Er, I will stop today. Empress, don't forget who was the one that made Jin Er unhappy!
talk_special_city03war011=Ahh, I cannot accept the fact that the low-life emperor was right in front of me and I did not kill him. I cannot get over this!
talk_special_city03war012=Ah.
talk_special_city03war013=I never thought that after so many years of hard work, I failed when I was so close!
talk_special_city03war014=Spare the man under your sword!
talk_special_city03war015=Jin Er, it's you, why have you come here?
talk_special_city03war016=Young master Lin, please call me Miaozhen, Jin Er is no longer of this world
talk_special_city03war017=Heroes, the Romantic Boy is a poor man. Let us members of Jianghu no longer ask about the matters between him and the emperor and spare him his life.
talk_special_city03war018=Jin Er...Jin Er, don't go!
talk_special_city03war019=It has been a long time and we have not yet been able to enter the Imperial Palace. It is time for me to cut in!
talk_special_city03war020=Oh no, there is a group of men that have been defeated!
talk_special_city03war021=Your highness, a man dressed in strange clothes rode a four-person imperial carriage into the Imperial Palace and is coming here to the Meridian Gate. We cannot stop him!
talk_special_city03war022=Hear my command! All men guard the Meridian Gate!
talk_special_city03war023=Oh no, there are people executing a coup during the solar eclipse. Soldiers, pick up your weapons and guard the Imperial Palace!
talk_special_city03war024=In order to avoid chaos and ensure the safety of all citizens, we have come to aid the imperial government!
talk_special_city03war025=We will first go to protect the emperor, you guys annihilate the other men and head for the Imperial Palace immediately.
talk_special_city03war026=Ling Yunyu, the soldiers are badly injured, I (the Emperor) have no choice but to withdraw the troops.
talk_special_city03war027=We have come this far. We cannot give up now.
talk_special_city03war028=Although success was not achieved today, what's important is that you are still alive. It is not worth it to sacrifice your life for this.
talk_special_city03war029=Alright, we will fight another day!
talk_special_city03war030=Your highness, the rebels have retreated. The soldiers have done their best, but Ling Yunyu still got away.
talk_special_clone013001=You guys look like you are from Tang Family. What are you doing here?
talk_special_clone013002=Our order is to arrest the Tang family traitor Qian Bofei, have you seen any suspicious person around?
talk_special_clone013003=I didn't see anyone suspicious. If you are chasing after someone, you took the wrong path. The only things you'll see down this path are my precious scorpions.
talk_special_clone013004=Why do you keep scorpions in this dark and cold are?
talk_special_clone013005=10 years ago I follow Young Master Tianzhi to Tianji Hall to investigate about Tianji Sting, but Young Master Tianzhi died in the process. Grandma punished me for my failure by sending me to breed scorpions in this maze. I've been here for 10 years and I miss the sun!
talk_special_clone013006=I have other more important task and cannot stay here to help you, good bye.
talk_special_clone013008=Are you here to deliver fertilizer?
talk_special_clone013009=Predecessors, we follow Grandma's order to capture our Tangmen's rebel Qian Bofei. Did you see anyone weird passing by?
talk_special_clone013010=Suspicious people. The only thing I allow to pass by are fertilizers. You guys all look tender and juicy which would be good food for my pets.
talk_special_clone013011=This guy is crazy!
talk_special_clone013013=You dare to hurt my pets. I'll going to kill you!
talk_special_clone013014=We saw you getting stinged by the Yuling Bee, why do you still consider them to be treasure?
talk_special_clone013015=Forget about me, I got this strange disease when I was young, each time it attacked me, it hurt so much and I could barely breathe. Only by getting bitten by the Yuling Bee would ease my pain.
talk_special_clone013016=Predecessors, we follow Grandma's order to capture our Tangmen's rebel Qian Bofei. Did you see anyone weird passing by?
talk_special_clone013017=I only have the Yuling Bees here. Go away!
talk_special_clone013018=Why are there so many strange people in Nine Inflexions Thought Road!
talk_special_clone013021=Why are you charging into our Forbidden Instance?
talk_special_clone013022=We have our order to chase Qian Bofei.
talk_special_clone013023=Are you the new Deacon Qian?
talk_special_clone013024=Why are you hurt? And why are there so many corpse on the floor?
talk_special_clone013025=We ambushed here and happened to meet Qian, he seemed to be in a hurry, so we talked to him. But he attacked us all of a sudden, we did our best to fight him, but he escaped. You better hurry up and chase him. I was hit by deadly poison from the Tianji Hall.
talk_special_clone013029=Who are you?
talk_special_clone013030=We have our order to chase Qian Bofei, why are you hurt?
talk_special_clone013031=We are ordered to deliver Qian to the Nine Inflexions Thought Road and use him to feed the beasts. We thought he was dead after taking all those poison, yet he got up and hurt us. We could not defeat him and he escaped.
talk_special_clone013032=Where are you guys going now?
talk_special_clone013033=The previous fighting already alerted Nine Inflexions Thought Road's brothers. You can follow the fighting path and find him! Nine Inflexions Thought Road includes many secret devices and poisons. While capturing him, you guys should be careful also!
talk_special_clone013034=Thank you for the reminder! Good bye!

talk_special_mpcs_02=Let's have some fun today. It will be more enjoyable to kill them one by one! Experience despair!
talk_special_mpcs_03=An omen has occurred, all disciples return to the clan and guard against an attack!
talk_special_mpcs_04=Boss, I am incompetent, I was not able to complete the task!
talk_special_task_1002=Young man, I can deliver you to a place. But don't know if you can exit from there.
talk_special_task_1003=Young man, you learned Two-tier jump so you can jumpt out of here. Then go find the Chef and he'll teach you about Hidden weapons.
talk_tgsr_01=Huh, this dumb giant is quite strong, but it is no use if he can't hit anyone. There is an ambush ahead, you guys go and clear the path for me. Don't let any of these rebels go
talk_tgsr_02=You do not need to worry anymore. As long as you work for me, you will be well taken care of
talk_tgsr_03=How dare you! I will not forgive you!

talk_wuzhen_tianqi_01=Hurry, go to the Luoyang Government Hall (1030 388). Do not delay, the Prefect is in grave danger.
talk_wuzhen_tianqi_02=Heroes, your money has been stolen by the Green Cloud Thief. Please hurry to the Luoyang South Gate (1056 846) to get back the government office caravan.
talk_wuzhen_tianqi_03=This time the evil scoundrels have a large number of archers on their side. The prefect has allotted two cannons to help us. This cannon is so powerful, it will surely severely hurt the head of the bandits.
talk_xjz_001=I am hungry, give me something to eat...
talk_xjz_002=Why is it so cold here…
talk_xjz_003=Water…water…give me some water

talk_yhgtaofa_boss3_02=Uh…it is indeed better for a researcher like me to stay in back.
talk_yhgtaofa_boss4_01=Damn women, how dare you hurt my brothers, you can all go to hell!
talk_yhgtaofa_boss4_02=Damn! I will pay you back for today's disgrace someday!

talk_yhgtaofa_boss5_02=In the words of Sun Zi, it is time to run!
talk_yhgtaofa_boss6_01=Although it was not my original intention, I had to intervene in the name of my deceased clan members…
talk_yhgtaofa_boss6_02=Huh! You are pretty good, but I, the Twelve-Linked Fortress will surely come back for revenge!
talk_yhgtaofa_fsgtm_01=Oh ha ha ha! You have been fooled!
talk_yhgtaofa_leader_01=It was because of the help from all of you sister apprentices that we were able to win the battle this time. Thank you for your efforts. In a moment, I will distribute the Palace Master's rewards to everyone.

jzsj_menu_01=Can you?
jzsj_title_01=Although your Yin Yang needle is one of a kind, it is still curable. It is said that the force of good can always defeat that of peculiarity. Thus, a peculiar needle wound can be cured by one of a positive noble force and position.
jzsj_menu_02=Will you do it?
jzsj_title_02=Don't worry. Shen Xijue may be my brother but I won't allow him to control others like this. Still yourself, I will now remove the Yin Yang needle.

jzsj_title_03=If you are ready, let us begin.
jzsj_menu_04=I am ready.

jzsj_title_05=Oh, you have already identified the taste? Tell me what it is.
jzsj_menu_06=I believe it contains licorice.
jzsj_title_06=No, no. Licorice does not have such a sticky texture. Think harder.
jzsj_menu_07=Sweet and transparent...this is merely honey.
jzsj_title_07=Not bad. I didn't think you would realize it was plain honey. I have tested many other disciples this way in the past and none of them dared to believe it would be something so simple.
jzsj_menu_08=You aren't trying to poison me with this, are you?
jzsj_title_08=Simply nonsense!
jzsj_menu_20=Wrong answer, let me think for a while.
jzsj_title_20=Classic.

talk_special_99000=Do not worry, my blade techniques are famous for being fast, aggressive, accurate, and stable. The entire process is safe and painless. All who have been cut by me have given me good praise, and the only regret they have is not being able to grow another one.
talk_special_99001=You look like someone with such potential and many natural gifts. You must have been meant to cut it off and join our Rootless Clan. Stop wasting your time and life.
talk_special_99002=According to the teachings of Lao Zi: the whitest of whites appears dark, the squarest of squares does not have edges, the greatest of people take longest to mature, the greatest of music has no sound, and the greatest appearance has no appearance at all. True knowledge often lies with those who are not famous. The truly wise are strong within but appear lackluster on the surface, they act effectively but are lacking in terms of words, they are aggressive in their actions and do not fear, they do not take the credit after something is accomplished; this is true enlightenment.
talk_special_99003=In the natural world, there is more negative than positive; in the human world, the is more positive than negative. We should comply with the norms of nature. All phenomena are derived from humanity. Yet, there are restrictions to the capabilities of man; whereas desires have no end. Trying to fill something that has no end with something finite will result in a life unhappiness. The philosophy of the Rootless Clan is based on the ways of the heavens. We first eliminate desire, then emulate the ways of the gods. Rootlessness results in the enlightenment of truth and the absence of desire makes you strong. In this way, we are able to preserve our powers and uphold the true ways of the universe.
talk_special_99004=Since ancient times, many talented people have come out of the Rootless Clan. We view the well-being of the world as our responsibility, serving the emperor and helping average citizens. We make friends with those far away when needed in order to attach enemies nearby. Our members are found throughout various levels of society. There is no other clan with such monumental achievements, nor is there any other clan comparable to us! Your being chosen by the Rootless Clan is a true blessing.
talk_special_99005=I told you not to move. You see, it is not straight. I always complete the cut in one strike. After that one strike, I never try to add another strike. This segment is was left over, you can decide what you want to do with it!

talk_fwz_02_j_002=You're not very good at pretending to be a beggar. You should at least wear some worn-out clothes and rub some dirt onto your face!
talk_fwz_02_j_003=I hear that someone had played a beggar in the past and even wrote a book called "An Actor's Self-Cultivation". He is very famous. I want to be famous as well...
talk_fwz_02_j_004=You don't have deep blue eyes or a sexy beard. There is no way you can become a man like that...
talk_fwz_02_j_005=Am I destined to not be able to be an actor? Oh god!
talk_fwz_02_k_001=Don't give up, Young Master...
talk_fwz_02_k_002=Don't give up. Don't give up...
task_jhdw_dh_npc01=Our Linwu Clan is good at restoring incomplete pieces of martial arts techniques to their entirety and learning from Jianghu Masters when they are performing their techniques.

menu_newworld_pld211_1_1=Please tell me about Penglai Island.
title_newworld_pld211_1_1=Legends say Penglai, largest of the Eastern Seass, is the home of immortals. Perhaps it is this legend that has continued to lure martial artists from the mainland. Today, four factions make their homes here: the righteous Clarion Cliff, the evil Demon Sword Blade, the sinister Sacred Moon Palace and the chaotic Justices of Fate. Don't take these moral alignments too seriously, though, for they do not accurately define the true nature of these mysterious factions.

newworld_pld212_2_1_1=Thank you for your introduction. Here is a letter of referral from your brother on Penglai.
task_newworld_pld213=Welcome to Wuji Island! You are to be commended for simply making it this far!
menu_newworld_pld213_1_1=Please tell me more about Wuji Island.
title_newworld_pld213_1_1=As you can see, Wuji is remote island, halfway between Japan and the Chinese mainland. The warring Japanese clans have established their stronghold here, whilst the imperial forces of the Ming Dynasty strive to reclaim this strategic speck of land.
menu_newworld_pld213_2_1=I see.
title_newworld_pld213_2_1=A Daimyo, or warlord, rules Wuji Island, and he is served by members of the Yagyu and Hattori clans. It is no secret that agents of the Chinese imperial army are here as well, to thwart the plans of these would-be foreign invaders.
newworld_pld213_2_1_1=Now I have a rough idea about Wuji Island. Here are the letters from a Penglai missionary.

menu_newworld_pld214_1_1=Please explain. What makes this cave so secret?
title_newworld_pld214_1_1=Hmm, since you're here, it may no longer be a secret. Anyway, If you have a particular token from that <font color="#FF0000">Old Rascal</font>, you can trade it with me for a part of a wondrous device.
newworld_pld214_1_1_1=I do have a token from Old Rascal. Is this it?
task_newworld_pld215=You are a lucky one, Young Hero. The secret area of Penglai is not so easy to get in.

title_newworld_pld220_1_1=It's called a secret area for a reason…but I'm willing to make a deal. Find me a treasure map of Penglai Island, and I'll give you a token, which you'll find most useful.

newworld_pld222_1_1_1=Let's begin the final trial.
task_newworld_pld228=To "ask" for a sword to reveal its power is to meditate on the meaning of swordsmanship. This esoteric discipline is the hallmark of Demon Sword Clan.
menu_newworld_pld228_1_1=May I try it?
title_newworld_pld228_1_1=You don't try it. You just do.

title_talk_npc_wjd_behav02_01=You there! We are constantly on the lookout for the Chinese imperial army. Go out there and see if there's any trouble!
menu_talk_npc_wjd_behav02_01=Just tell me where I have to go.
title_talk_npc_wjd_behav02_0101=Check the places marked on this map. Then return to give me a full report.
menu_talk_npc_wjd_behav02_0101=Very well, I'm on my way.
talk_wjd_ls01_01=To be a skilled swordsman, you must practice hard for the rest of your life.
talk_wjd_ls02_01=As a swordsman, you must keep practicing every day.
talk_wjd_ls04_01=Both my sister and father force me to practice every single day...It is driving me mad! I'm already as good as a true swordmaster.
talk_wjd_ls05_01=I am a maid and guide at Yagyu Clan. If you want to learn how to make tea sets, feel free to ask.
talk_wjd_ls05_02=I'd like to make a tea set.
talk_wjd_ls05_03=To learn how to make a tea set, you will need at least 1 unit of clay. Do you have it?
talk_wjd_ls05_04=Here it is. Please, let us begin.
talk_wjd_ls05_05=You've done it! You can do better than that, though, if you don't mind my saying.
talk_wjd_ls05_06=Collect Clay
talk_wjd_ls05_07=I enjoy making tea sets. Will you bring me some clay for them?
talk_wjd_ls05_08=Where can I get some clay?
talk_wjd_ls05_09=You can find plenty of clay along the seashore. However, you will need to borrow a tool from the villagers at North Bay Village, just down the hill.
talk_wjd_ls05_10=Understood. I'll be right back.
talk_wjd_ls05_11=Thank you. Every time you want to make a better tea set, just come to me with some clay!
talk_wjd_ls05_12=If you want to learn how to make a better tea set, come to me with some clay!
talk_wjd_ls05_13=Thank you, I will.
talk_wjd_ls05_14=Do you have some clay for me?
talk_wjd_ls05_15=I'm sorry, I forgot. I'll go get some now.
talk_wjd_ls06_01=I'll protect the elder sister no matter what!
talk_wjd_ls07a_01=I must train as hard as I can to become a master swordsman!
talk_wjd_ls08a_01=I am desperate to meet a real opponent! One I can cut down!
talk_wjd_ls09a_01=If you want to be better than anyone else, even me…you must train!
talk_wjd_rz03_00=The key to a military victory is good intelligence!
talk_wjd_rz03_01=Well done. You're becoming a fine ninja indeed!
talk_wjd_rz03_02=Thank you, sir.
talk_wjd_rz03_03=I told you to get a villager's outfit, and blend in to collect their gossip…are you incapable of following these simple instructions?
talk_wjd_rz03_04=I heard that spies from the Chinese imperial army are spotted at the village. Go and investigate.
talk_wjd_rz03_05=Of course. Since you are my superior, I'd appreciate your advice.
talk_wjd_rz03_06=Hmm…go get a villager's outfit, I don't care how you do it. Once you have your disguise, blend in, and collect their latest gossip.
talk_wjd_rz03_07=Understood.
talk_wjd_rz03_08=Check the North Bay Village
talk_wjd_rz03_09=Check Wuji Island
talk_wjd_dm03_00=Small as it is, there are spots of extraordinary beauty on this island.
talk_wjd_dm03_01=Painting
talk_wjd_dm03_02=I would very much like to enjoy the scenery here on this remote island, which is unlike those back home in Japan. Unfortunately, as I am unskilled in the martial arts, I am advised not to leave the safety of the garrison. Would you be so kind as to make sketches of the places you visit here in the Eastern Seas?
talk_wjd_dm03_03=It would be my pleasure, my lady.
talk_wjd_dm03_04=Did you bring me any scenic sketches?
talk_wjd_dm03_05=I'm working on it.
talk_wjd_dm03_06=Thank you! These drawings are lovely!
talk_wjd_dm03_07=It's my privilege to share the beauty of this island with you, my lady.
talk_wjd_dm04_00=The Chinese imperial army is upon us. We must never let down our guard!
talk_wjd_dm04_01=Why are you still here? Weren't you just ordered to scout the island?
talk_wjd_dm04_02=Well done. Your brave deeds will not go unrecognized.
talk_wjd_dm04_03=Thank you, sir.
talk_wjd_dm04_04=The humid and salty air on this island is very corrosive. Go polish the weapons on the weapon rack.
talk_wjd_dm04_05=Of course, sir.
talk_wjd_dm04_06=Good job. You're dismissed.
talk_wjd_dm04_07=Thank you Master for your praise.
talk_wjd_dm04_08=Why are you still hanging around here? Didn't I tell you to polish the weapons?
talk_wjd_dm04_09=I'm on it!
talk_wjd_dm04_10=Collect Food
talk_wjd_dm04_11=Maintenance of Weapons
talk_wjd_dm05_01=I'm so homesick! When will I ever go back to Japan?
talk_wjd_dm06_01=You look like you know how to wield a sword! Care to spar with me for a while?
talk_wjd_dm07_01=The Chinese imperial army can attack at any time! Be vigilant!
talk_wjd_cp_jh_01=I have perfected my clan's One-Blade Ryu technique. My cuts are swift, clean, and always lethal.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_01a=Indeed, upon full mastery, the One-Blade Ryu becomes a most efficient technique, thus easily defeating the Shinto Ryu or the Shinsen-Yin Ryu.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_01b=Indeed, the One-Blade Ryu has been refined to perfection over many generations. You will not find another style of swordsmanship with comparable depth or subtlety.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_01c=I hear that One-Blade Ryu is a multi-faceted technique that excels in both offense and defense. I've always wanted to learn it!
talk_wjd_cp_jh_01a1=Well said. You are most insightful.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_01b1=You speak with such authority on this subject. I'm impressed.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_01c1=Now you're just making this up.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_02=It is no accident that I am from the Yagyu Clan. Only descendents of such a noble house are worthy of being trained to be the greatest of swordsmen.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_02a=Yet nobility is not only given, it is also be earned. For me, there is no shame in earning my place by merit.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_02b=I am not so bad with a sword. Perhaps my skills will surpass even yours someday.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_02c=I question the quality of your training. I hear your sensei speaks much of the way of the sword, and yet never lifts a weapon. It's as though he has eyes, but chooses not to see.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_02a1=You speak with humility and wisdom. I am moved.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_02b1=We'll see about that.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_02c1=You fool! My teacher doesn't see, because he is blind! Even as a blind man, I'll bet he can easily defeat such a pompous ass as you!
talk_wjd_cp_jh_03=See those samurais? Some come from the Hattori Clan, who are no more than ruffians with fancy blades. We of the Yugyu Clan wield our swords with authority, and purpose.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_03a=Lead your men not by your entitlement of nobility, but your example of chivalry and courage.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_03b=The Yagyu clan's history goes back for centuries. Don't be impressed by the Hattoris, they are but upstarts from peasant stock.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_03c=You do not choose to be born into the Yagyu Clan, or a Hattori. Consider yourself fortunate that you have made it this far.
talk_wjd_cp_jh_03a1=Well said! I wholeheartedly agree!
talk_wjd_cp_jh_03b1=How dare you even utter the names of Yagyu and Hattori in one breath? The Hattoris are not worthy of such comparison!
talk_wjd_cp_jh_03c1=Are you implying that I'm just a hack who's getting by with dumb luck? Damn you!
talk_wjd_cp_lr_01=I don't mean to brag, but many do say I am rather attractive. If only my eyes are a little bigger, though…
talk_wjd_cp_lr_01a=Do not judge yourself by other people's standards. Your beauty is uniquely your own.
talk_wjd_cp_lr_01b=Say no more of your eyes. They're just fine.
talk_wjd_cp_lr_01c=If I were to say your eyes were too small, I'd only be deferring to your own opinion.
talk_wjd_cp_lr_01a1=There is wisdom in your words of flattery. Intriguing.
talk_wjd_cp_lr_01b1=Be honest with me! I'd rather you speak the truth, than to pity me with false compliments.
talk_wjd_cp_lr_01c1=And who are you to be a judge of beauty? Just take a look at yourself…
talk_wjd_cp_lr_02=Isn't this sword of mine simply magnificent? It cuts through steal like cloth, and there's hardly a scratch on it! I have lost count the number of battles I've won with it!
talk_wjd_cp_lr_02a=A sword is only as fine as the its wielder. Perhaps you are being modest with your own abilities?
talk_wjd_cp_lr_02b=I see that you do value your weapon highly. You have been taking very good care of it…there is not a single wear or scratch.
talk_wjd_cp_lr_02c=Perhaps there's a reason you're giving more credit to your weapon, than your own ability to use it.
talk_wjd_cp_lr_02a1=You are most perceptive.
talk_wjd_cp_lr_02b1=What are you suggesting? That I rarely use my sword at all?
talk_wjd_cp_lr_02c1=How dare you…want to feel just how sharp my sword is?
talk_wjd_cp_lr_03=For as long as we have occupied Wuji Island, the Chinese have been trying to take it from us. I dare say, if it were not for my superior swordsmanship, they would have long succeeded.
talk_wjd_cp_lr_03a=The Chinese have too much pride in their individual martial arts expertise. They are no match to a well organized and disciplined defense, led by such a dedicated warrior as yourself.
talk_wjd_cp_lr_03b=Those foolish Chinese come to you with their fists and kicks. Of course you're going to cut them down with your tempered Japanese steel!
talk_wjd_cp_lr_03c=The Chinese are skilled in martial arts, but you have other ways of defeating them - by your superiority in numbers, and tactical advantage in holding your defensive positions.
talk_wjd_cp_lr_03a1=You flatter me, but I do agree.
talk_wjd_cp_lr_03b1=You're just stating the obvious.
talk_wjd_cp_lr_03c1=Are you suggesting that my martial arts are no match for the Chinese? I'll show you how good I am!
talk_wjd_cp_zq_01=Those Yagyu samurais just think they're better than anyone else, don't they? Without their stuck-up noses and fancy gear, they're no better than the ashigaru troopers!
talk_wjd_cp_zq_01a=Such injustice! Here in this garrison, we should advance in ranks by our merit, not by the names given to us at birth!
talk_wjd_cp_zq_01b=They're Yagyu. They think the whole world should serve them.
talk_wjd_cp_zq_01c=Look, if you think the Yagyus are so stuck-up, why don't you just tell them straight in their faces? They may look up to you for being so blunt…
talk_wjd_cp_zq_01a1=You speak the truth.
talk_wjd_cp_zq_01b1=Duh. Tell me something I don't know!
talk_wjd_cp_zq_01c1=What the…are you trying to get me killed? I'll kill you first!
talk_wjd_cp_zq_02=My wife is so beautiful, gentle and kind…how I miss her! I haven't seen her for such a long time…I wonder how she is now?
talk_wjd_cp_zq_02a=You are blessed to have such a fine wife. I wish both of you a most joyous reunion.
talk_wjd_cp_zq_02b=A fine wife, you say? She must be very good to you in the house…you know what I mean, don’t you?
talk_wjd_cp_zq_02c=Why so sad? If you need to be a with woman, just pick one right here, right now!
talk_wjd_cp_zq_02a1=Thank you, you are most kind.
talk_wjd_cp_zq_02b1=So? Is this any of your concern?
talk_wjd_cp_zq_02c1=What the hell…are you trying to ruin my marriage?
talk_wjd_cp_zq_03=So, I picked up this sword on the beach the other day. I sold it, bought a chicken, sold that, bought a duck, sold that, bought a goat, sold that, bought a pig…I'm gonna be rich!
talk_wjd_cp_zq_03a=Your entrepreneurial spirit is most commendable. Let prudence and perserverance be your guide to prosperity!
talk_wjd_cp_zq_03b=You're destined to be a rich man. I can feel it!
talk_wjd_cp_zq_03c=You are a business genius! Lend me some money…we can invest in some prime oceanfront real estate here on this island!
talk_wjd_cp_zq_03a1=Such big words, just what I want to hear! Ha ha!
talk_wjd_cp_zq_03b1=Oh, I'm just getting by for my family.
talk_wjd_cp_zq_03c1=What the hell are you saying? I don’t have that kind of money!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_01=Where are my sheep and goats…those damn pirates must have made muttons out of them by now! I also saw two of them taking Old Wang's black dog…they such animals!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_01a=I just saw your sheep up the hill. Go get them!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_01b=The pirates are coming! Run!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_01c=The pirates didn't take your sheep…it was Two-Dog Wang! I saw it with my own eyes!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_01a1=Really? Thank you, I'll go get them now!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_01b1=They must have taken my sheep! I'll kill them!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_01c1=Impossible! It had to be the pirates! Don't lie to me!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_02=That lovely girl…I've always liked her since we were children, and now she's become such a fine young woman! But she never pays me any attention…what am I to do?
talk_wjd_zp_cm_02a=Bring her lots of big, fat fish. Not only will you win her affection, but once she gets fat, no one will fight with you over her!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_02b=Two can play hard-to-get. Just ignore her the way she ignores you. Soon, it will be she who craves for your attention!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_02c=Young women always say one thing when they mean something else. Bring her things that will scare her - snakes, toads, spiders and the like. The more you freak her out, the more she'll like you!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_02a1=That doesn’t sound very nice…but I'm out of options! Very well, I'll start catching some fish for her.
talk_wjd_zp_cm_02b1=Really? You're not kidding, are you?
talk_wjd_zp_cm_02c1=That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_03=Old Wang tells me there's gold in those hills. But I've been digging all day and found not a damn thing! Now Old Wang is nowhere to be seen…did he just find the gold and leave without me?
talk_wjd_zp_cm_03c=The gold is there in the hills. I saw it myself!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_03b=I just saw Old Wang digging up something at the hills. Maybe he did find gold, and wanted to keep it all for himself!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_03a=What gold? Old Wang made you go out to the hills, so he can be with your wife!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_03c1=You'd just tell me something like that? How dumb do you think I am?
talk_wjd_zp_cm_03b1=Is this true? Don't lie to me!
talk_wjd_zp_cm_03a1=That bastard! I'm gonna kill him!
talk_wjd_zhapian=This guy doesn't look very bright. Let's have a little fun with him.
talk_wjd_chuipeng=Let me flatter him a bit to cheer him up.
talk_wjd_qiecuo=I am keen on improving my martial arts skills, May we have a sparring match, so that I may put my skills to the test?
talk_wjd_qiecuo_1=I'm rather tired right now. Come back after I got some rest.
talk_wjd_qiecuo_2=You may have defeated me this time, but I have learned much from you! May we spar again soon!
talk_wjd_qiecuo_3=That's fine with me. Farewell.
talk_wjd_qiecuo_4=Please show me what you know!
talk_wjd_cm01_01=Our families have been living peacefully in this fishing village for generations. Then these Japanese pirates came to the island, raiding our homes and demanding tribute! It's been a nightmare!
talk_wjd_cm01_02=Sir, do you speak and read Japanese?
talk_wjd_cm01_03=We've been dealing with these foreigners for so long, of course we picked up their language…why do you ask?
talk_wjd_cm01_04=I need to infiltrate their garrison and gather intelligence. I was wondering if you can show me a phrase or two that I'd recognize.
talk_wjd_cm01_05=Well, I'm not sure which phrases a spy would need to know, so I'll just start with the basics. Take the character あ, which is pronounced "ah". Just repeat after me.
talk_wjd_cm01_06=Understood. Please begin.
talk_wjd_cm01_07=I'd like learn some Japanese!
talk_wjd_cm01_08=Correct! You're good at this!
talk_wjd_cm01_09=Thank you.
talk_wjd_cm01_10=That's incorrect. Try again.
talk_wjd_cm01_11=This is harder than I thought…
talk_wjd_cm01_teach01=Listen carefully. あ(a), い(i), う(u), え€, お(o). Have you memorized these pronunciations?
talk_wjd_cm01_teach01a=I think I've got it. Go ahead with your questions.

talk_wjd_behavior27_4=I will bring you to the ninja shrine. Steal some weapons from the weapon racks there. Don't engage the enemies, the place is too heavily guarded.
talk_wjd_behavior27_5=Noted. Let's go.

talk_wjd_behavior27_11=Good idea. I'll do that.
talk_wjd_behavior27_12=Good. In one swoop, we've sabotaged the enemy and armed the villagers, all thanks to you.
