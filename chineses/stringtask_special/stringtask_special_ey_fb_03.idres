
dialogid_33300=These bandits make it unbearable to live here.
dialogid_33301=There's no need for you to get into trouble for my sake. You are so young, and I don't want anything to happen to you.
dialogid_33302=There's a word of "Sixty" on the back of the token, and it's the identifier of Yamen Constables. "Sixty" should be the guy Yan Xing's token, but he isn't in the Yamen now.
dialogid_33303=You can fish? You are a genius.
dialogid_33305=You are unexpectedly powerful. You have caught so many fish in such a short time!
dialogid_33306=This token belong to the Suzhou Yamen Captors, why is it in your hand?
dialogid_33307=I want you to help me look for Constable Yan Xing. You can go to the south of the city to look for him.
dialogid_33308=I'm Constable Yan Xing. Who are you? Go away if you have nothing to do!
dialogid_33309=I discovered a group of bandits. While tracking them, they noticed me and I was in a furious battle with them. Because only one of me fighting against the many, I was seriously injured, so I escaped when they weren't noticing.
dialogid_33311=I seal some acupoints and apply your herb to my wound. I have staunched the flow of blood.
dialogid_33312=I heard that those robbers would gather their partnerships to do something bad when I tracked them. I can not allow them to harm people any more. They seemed to go to Coffin House outside of the South Town. Please seek their trace for me.
dialogid_33313=These evil bandits, don't know how many more families they would kill if it wasn't for you. You are such a righteous person and very powerful. I greatly admire you.
dialogid_33315=So Constable Yan asked you to come. It is so good. Are you also a constable?
dialogid_33316=I don't know. I only saw them kill all the people and burn all the houses that they saw after they got off the boat. I was so scared at that time, so I ferried back at once. When I went afar, I turned round and saw the small fishing village full of flames. It was a terrible scene. I don't know if there's still anyone alive in the village.
dialogid_33317=Can you go to the fishing village to see whether my relative is still alive?
dialogid_33318=Be careful. Keeping yourself alive is the most important task.
dialogid_33319=These evil man's leader is from Han Family of Xi Mountain, they are currently at Zhao Family.
dialogid_33320=Help! Save the innocent villagers!
dialogid_33321=You've helped us so much; we should trouble you no longer.
dialogid_33322=Thank you for telling me this piece of news. I am glad to know he is fine. But it is a pity that those villagers...
dialogid_33323=Take the key to the box - the treasures inside will be very helpful.
dialogid_33324=Your skills are good and you are also smart. I think it will be ok if I give it to you.
dialogid_33325=Seven-Kill resurfacing would worry everyone. I sure hope I don't fall victim.
dialogid_33328=The battle 8 years ago happened in North-eastern area, if you are interested, you can go and take a look, maybe you'll find some clues. I am also preparing to go and investigate.
dialogid_33329=I came here just to take a look to see if I can find some evidence of past, but when I arrived I saw this Mysterious Lady. I was just going to ask her if she knows anything, but she started fighting against me without any reason.
dialogid_33330=I think there must be some reasons. Or you go to ask what happened.
dialogid_33331=Where have all the kind people gone?
dialogid_33332=Just kill Shi Shujun for me and I'll tell you the story of the past. After killing him, come and find me at Guyue Nunnery.
dialogid_33333=Are you the person my Younger Martial Sister is waiting for?
dialogid_33334=Good, you have great courage, just don't know if you have the capabilities.
dialogid_33336=We get news that Zhao Ziji is still alive! He lives in a Fishing Village of Taihu Lake secretly now. In those years he was gone with Seven Kills Order. If you can go to the Fishing Village and take back Seven Kills Order for us, we will let those people off!
dialogid_33338=You come back so soon. Have you got Seven-kill Order?
dialogid_33341=Thank you for saving me! I will repay you someday.
dialogid_33342=They are after us! Run! I'll take them down!
dialogid_33343=Constable Yan's letter? What's wrong?
dialogid_33344=Your martial skills are very amazing with your age. I am very impressed.
dialogid_33346=Maybe innocent people will be hurt this time, too bad I am injured...
dialogid_33347=Who are you anyway? How dare you try to control us Royal Guards!
dialogid_33348=We just come for rebels. Why do you stop us? You must be one of the rebels. Catch him!
dialogid_33350=What do you want to do?
dialogid_33351=Last night? I was at the Suzhou city inn! Please, don't kill me!
dialogid_33353=Don't kill me; I'll tell you everything.
dialogid_33355=I dare not cheat you. I have told you what I know. Please don't hurt me.
dialogid_33356=You seem sad, what happened?
dialogid_33357=So that's it. But I think it is not so simple. At the east bank of Tai Lake, there is a small fishing village called "Twilight Village". I think it is the right place. How do you go there?
dialogid_33361=You seem sad, what happened?
dialogid_33363=When I recover I will go to the small fishing village to help the remaining villagers rebuild their houses.
dialogid_33365=I know Zhu Zhiheng will come and find me. He made a mistake himself and I have to deal with it for him. This time he owes me one. Go and find a Eunuch name Wu Zhong at Suzhou City, his nickname is Aunty Wu, he's the one who found out the information. Just call him "Aunty Wu".

okmenu_33313=Constable Yan, thank you. Getting rid of an evil for people is our responsibility originally. It doesn't matter.
okmenu_33314=Constable Yan, don't worry. Let me deal with this matter.
okmenu_33315=No, I'm only a friend of Captor Yan, this is his letter, you take a look.
okmenu_33316=These people are too bad. They even killed villagers unarmed.
okmenu_33317=Take it easy. I'll handle this.
okmenu_33318=Thank you for your warning. I will be careful.
okmenu_33320=Everything's fine. Let me take care of the villagers' business.

okmenu_33338=Here it is. I hope you can keep your promise.
okmenu_33339=Brother, speak no more of it. I'll buy you some life-saving pills. You should heal your wounded first.
okmenu_33341=To give help is our duty when we find injustice. Don't decline, dear Brother.
okmenu_33342=Be careful, brother. They are now my enemies.
okmenu_33343=Ah. You will know after you see it.
okmenu_33344=Brother, you'll be fine. You are just injured.
okmenu_33346=Brother, you just need to recover in peace. I'll investigate it myself.

okmenu_33361=It's a long story.
okmenu_33363=Thank you for caring, brother. It's time for me to leave.
okmenu_33365=Ok, I'm going now.
story_33316_1=I was afraid something will happen, so I paddled a boat and followed them. In order to avoid discovering by them, my boat left them very far. I saw that they stopped their boat and entered Fishing Village.
story_33316_2=I stopped my boat on the river and watched far away. But in a few moments, Fishing Village was on fire. I knew it had an accident. I was very sacred at that time. So I rocked my boat and left, readied to report a case to the Government.
story_33316_3=I have to ask you do me a favor, and I'm so grateful.
story_33326_1=The Seven Killing Sect disappeared eight years ago, and since, peace has been restored. Now, the sect is making a return.
story_33326_3=The Seven Killing Sect disappeared after losing a three-day battle by the Tai Lake.
story_33327_1=Zhao Ziji of the Seven Killing Sect killed many martial arts experts. He is quite skilled.
story_33327_2=It's more than powerful. His Seven Moves Animitta Sword is shapeless and as fast as lightning. It can kill you with one stroke of sword suddenly.
story_33327_3=Many died by his hands. People have gone back to the location to find clues, but to no avail.
story_33327_4=Although the traces of the war have been washed away by the sands of time, we can feel the chi and blood.
story_33335_2=A mysterious man put a bounty of all the members of Xi Mountain and we accepted it. The task turned out to be not as easy as it seemed.
story_33335_4=Zhao Ziji accepted the dangerous task for Seven-kill Order. He completed the task unexpectedly: nearly all people in Han family of Xi Mountain were killed by him? He will be the next leader of the order if the old leader dies.
story_33335_5=Zhao Ziji forgot about one person in killing the Han family of Xi Mountain - Han Sijin. Sijin aroused many factions to join together in an attack against Zhao Ziji. His death ended the Seven Killing Sect.
story_33335_6=Not just anyone can offend the Seven Killing Sect. Those in the battle were survivors.
story_33335_7=Anyone who stands in our way will be killed.
story_33339_1=This place is dangerous - you should leave.
story_33339_3=It is just a small wound. I will be fine.
story_33345_1=I came here yesterday midnight and got sound ahead. I was curious and went to have a look. I moved to the sound carefully...
story_33345_2=When I went close, I found many Mysterious People moving toward the west. I didn't think too much then and followed them distantly. They led me to the depth of a forest. Finally, I found their true identities.
story_33345_3=I think the Royal Guards may be planning something.
story_33345_4=I was found by secret guards of Royal Guards because of my carelessness. So I was chased by them later. Now I am lucky because I am still alive.
story_33354_1=This action requires many people and supplies; so I was curious and decided to wander around the campsite, hoping I could get some useful information.
story_33354_2=From the Royal Guards brought by the Chiliarch, the goal for this trip is to kill the descendents of Zhang Shicheng, a General from the previous dynasty.
story_33354_3=Zhang Shicheng, the traitor, was defeated by the grand master many years ago. The descendants from one of the branches escaped to Tai Lake but the Royal Guards recently found them.
story_33354_4=He is supposedly at a Fishing Village east of Tai Lake, but I'm not sure of the actual location.
story_33362_1=How did this happen? Did Royal Guards do this?
story_33362_2=Did you mean other forces? Does it mean that the ruin of the Fishing Village was done by other forces?
story_33362_3=You mean the Royal Guards members provoked other forces secretly and went to the Fishing Village! It's not surprising that the Royal Guards act in such a way.
story_33362_4=Thank you on behalf of the dead.
story_33362_5=I hope something like this never happens again. Take care in your future travels.
story_33363_1=My informant tells me that Zhong Guanggui of Suzhou City keeps in contact with Xiong Batian. Find him and you'll get your intelligence.
story_33363_2=No, Xing Batian saved his life. This type of criminals value life-savers very highly, so carelessly catching him might alert Xing Batian. I think maybe he would carry letters between him and Xing Batian, you go and steal it.
story_menu_33316=They have an advantage in numbers.
story_menu_33326=It's hard to stay out of trouble.
story_menu_33327=Please go on.
