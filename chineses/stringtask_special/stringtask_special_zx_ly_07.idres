
DialogID_13151=You have ambition. I will try to cure Jiuchen and can't go with you. You can leave first.
DialogID_13152=Leader of the Hanshan Temple outside Suzhou used to travel to the Southern area. He probably knows something about the bug poison technique. You can go to Hanshan Temple to find the cure.
DialogID_13153=I don't know about this bug poison. But Bai Suyu from Five Immortal must know how to cure it.
DialogID_13154=Bai Fu mentioned about some young ladies. You can go and have a look.
DialogID_13155=Stop beating me. I merely heard the story of the girl from the local gangsters. I know nothing else.
DialogID_13156=You want to get some clues from me? Give me 20 Liang, or else no way I'll tell you.
DialogID_13157=That day I saw the young lady was kidnapped. The kidnappers all dressed in black. One of them has only one arm.
DialogID_13158=So it's the people in black that kidnapped the young lady. The investigation is getting more and more difficult.
DialogID_13159=Why don't we start the investigation from Murong Family? Maybe we will get some clues. Nangong Yu from the Nangong Family already went to Murong Family. We should go help him.
DialogID_13160=Not any random person can enter Murong Villa. You don't seem powerful in martial arts. What do you have to help with investigating the case? I think you are here to make troubles.
DialogID_13161=I investigate around here and can't find a single clue. You'd better to ask Murong Qianqiu for clues.
DialogID_13162=What I know is not much (feeling sad). I put up the bounty and hope the murder can be found as soon as possible. You should go ask the maid Zhuer for clues.
DialogID_13163=I just got a clue. There is hatred between the Royal Guard and the Murong Family, and between Plum Blossom Sect and the Murong Family. How about I go check on the Royal Guard and you go check on the Plum Blossom Sect?
DialogID_13164=What? (Unrestted) A single arm man? I have never seen anyone like that. (Pretend to be calm.) There is no one like that here. You must be mistaken.
DialogID_13165=Murong Villa? We have hatred with them. Yet you dare to help them. Guys, come on.
DialogID_13166=Who are you? You don't deserve my time to talk to you. But if you can defeat my student Huan Rou and Fang Qing, then I will give you a chance.
DialogID_13167=Your exceptional martial arts are unexpected. Why don't you join us?
DialogID_13168=This is a blue jade pill, made from the three materials you got. It can help to suppress the poison. Take it.
DialogID_13169=I found and killed the robbers. I didn't expect it to be so easy. Let me tell Murong Qianqiu.
DialogID_13170=Nangong Yu is such a genius. It took him so little time to find the robbers. I will fulfill my promise and marry my fourth daughter to him.
DialogID_13171=One arm man? I saw him before. He is in the villa.
DialogID_13172=(Unrestted) You must have the wrong person. I don't know what you mean.
DialogID_13173=What a surprise that you know about everything. Only the dead people won't leak the secret. Sorry young man. You know too much. Kill this guy now.
DialogID_13174=I see. He lied to us. You should go to the Yanyu Villa and participate in the Wulin Tournament. When all the wulin heroes gather, show the evil plan of Murong Qianqiu to everyone.
QiecuoMenu_13151=Excuse me.
QiecuoMenu_13153=If you don't want to talk about it, I will get it done my way. Sorry for that.
QiecuoMenu_13155=Excuse me.
QiecuoMenu_13158=Really? Let me have a try.
QiecuoMenu_13159=Excuse me.
QiecuoMenu_13160=Thanks for dueling.
QiecuoMenu_13161=If you don't want to talk about it, I won't let it end well. Be prepared.
QiecuoTitle_13151=Ask me for clues? No way.
QiecuoTitle_13153=Why would I be scared of a young man like you?
QiecuoTitle_13155=I didn't expect you are not that bad. Let's see if you can pass my test.
QiecuoTitle_13158=You are all useless. I will have to handle it myself. Not many can beat me yet.
QiecuoTitle_13159=Let's start.
QiecuoTitle_13160=I'm ready.

okmenu_13151=I shall be on my way then.
okmenu_13152=Thanks for the guide.
okmenu_13153=Yes, I will need your recommendation.
okmenu_13154=Thanks for the clue. I will go now.
okmenu_13155=Bandits? Does it have anything to do with bandits?
okmenu_13156=Are you sure you don't want to tell? I will beat you up.
okmenu_13157=One arm? (This clue is important.) I see. I will let Jie Bao know.
okmenu_13158=Yes.
okmenu_13159=I'll leave immediately.
okmenu_13160=I am here to investigate. Don't test my limit or I will beat you up.
okmenu_13161=That's good. I will go now.
okmenu_13162=Maid? Zhuer? I will go now.
okmenu_13163=Let's do it.
okmenu_13164=I found a one arm man and followed him. But surprisingly, he disappears.
okmenu_13165=Calm down. Why beat people up?
okmenu_13166=I have to follow the order.
okmenu_13167=Thank you. But I won't do it.
okmenu_13168=Thank you.
okmenu_13169=I feel it is a bit weird.
okmenu_13170=Nangong Yu claims he killed the criminal. But I feel there is more to it.
okmenu_13171=It's not that simple. Did you see a one arm man in Murong Villa?
okmenu_13172=Don't act innocent. I saw you were together with that man in black.
okmenu_13173=I will make sure everyon in wulin knows that you collude with Royal Guard.
okmenu_13174=It's all Murong Qianqiu's evil plan. We all fell for it. I need to let Wudang know about it.
story_13151_1=The young lady from Murong Villa died in the temple. Murong Family put up bounty to look for the murderer. These people are here to help the investigation.
story_13151_2=Young man, now that we know each other and this happens in Hanshan Temple. Can you help to investigate this case and bring peace to the temple?
story_13152_1=The young lady came here to pray every now and then. Few days ago, she came to pray as usual but got kidnapped outside the temple. The next day, a headless female corpse was found nearby, with the exact same clothes that young lady was wearing when she was kidnapped. Murong Family announced that anyone who can kill the murderer will be rewarded with a lot of money and can marry the young lady's elder sister.
story_13152_2=As for the clue, everyone has a different theory about it, and there is no supporting evidence. You can go find Fang Yi and see if he knows anything.
story_13153_1=I don't know much. All I know is the lady went to pray everyday and suddenly one day she was kidnapped.
story_13153_2=Yes, there are 2 maids that follow the lady around. One of them, Cuier, disappeared together with the lady.
story_13154_1=Even though Plum Blossom Sect and Murong Villa have hatred against each other, we never revenge in such a despicable way.
story_13154_2=Murong Qianqiu is deceitful hypocrite. Rumor says that Murong Family already colludes with the government. There must be some conspiracy involved. Please be careful.
story_13155_1=I confess. It's all Murong Qianqiu's conspiracy. Murong Family wants to expand its influence by political marriage with the other families. But the ladies in Murong Family refuse to marry like this. So Murong Qianqiu comes up with this idea, so that the ladies can't refuse. And at the same time, it also brings attention to Murong Family's enemies and jianghu people will help him revenge. It kills two birds with one stone.
story_13155_2=The fifth lady was guarded by the Royal Guard.
story_13156_1=My name is Cuier.
story_13156_2=(Crying) My lady was locked up by the Royal Guard. Yesterday after they fell asleep, she and I tried to escape but got caught. Then she was killed in order to save me. Please help my lady revenge.

storymenu_13152_1=I see. Is there any clue?
storymenu_13152_2=Thank you. I will go now.
storymenu_13153_1=Really? Do you know any other clues?
storymenu_13153_2=2 people are missing. Why is there only 1 corpse? It's suspicious.
storymenu_13154_1=So it is.
storymenu_13154_2=Thank you for the reminder.
storymenu_13155_1=Where is the fifth lady now?
storymenu_13155_2=Murong Family really colludes with the Royal Guard.
