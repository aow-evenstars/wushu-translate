DialogID_74003=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ugh. How unfortunately. I will not force you, but can you show us your talents just a bit? Spar with my guards, so they can know there are always someone better in this big world.</font>
DialogID_74004=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Nice moves. I'm no match for you. I heard Tianwaitian was after you. Is it true? I still hope you can work for the Imperial Court. It is better than being chased by an assassin organization.</font>
DialogID_74005=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Enough small talk. Why are you here?</font>
DialogID_74006=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I can't be much help.

There are some mysterious people around the Imperial Mausoleum and we can't get close enough. I was only staying here to wait for my chance.</font>
DialogID_74009=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Based on the information you have gathered this must be one of their campsite. Try to sneak in and investigate. You can go meet with my secret agent first. We have prepared a Silent Temple token and have learned their pass code.</font>

DialogID_74011=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I know you are confused. I can only tell you that I work for the Imperial Court, and so does Lu Xin. We were sent here to watch Lord Qin. He is not as simple as you think. You can go ask around. I hope you can help us watch him in secret. You can visit our secret agent in Lord Qin Manor if you are up for it.</font>
DialogID_74012=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Wulin is in chaos nowadays. The alliance leader has locked himself inside his home and many people of Jianghu have been contacting Lord Qin in secret. I wonder if Lord Qin can bring peace back to Wulin.</font>

DialogID_74014=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Lord Qin loves to befriend people of Jianghu. It's a good thing if he wants to solve the conflict between Wulin and Imperial Court, but it would be disastrous if he has something else in mind.</font>

DialogID_74016=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You have proven yourself capable. Jianghu is in chaos, the Imperial Court hope the balance between the Court, Jianghu, and Lord Qin can be kept. Give Lord Qin a push when it's the right time. Bring him to the spotlight.</font>
DialogID_74017=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Good thing you are safe. I heard what happened in the Imperial Mausoleum. It was bad planning on my part.</font>
DialogID_74018=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The situation do seem strange. Let me arrange my affairs first, then I will step up and return order back to Wulin. I would need your help.</font>
DialogID_74020=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Based on this letter, it looks like the Silent Temple wants me dead. Looks like I can't avoid it any longer.</font>
