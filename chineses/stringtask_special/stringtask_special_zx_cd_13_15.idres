story_17301_3=<s>To the best of my knowledge, possibly Nine Yin Manual is in the hands of Jiugong Elder. He once defeated Blade Demon Ancestor with kung fu similar to Nine Yin Manual. But no one knows if the treasure map of Tang Family Castle is true.
story_17302_1=Are you grandson of Feng Sheng, Duke Song and one of the founders of Ming Dynasty? When many foundation officials left Zhu Yuanzhang, Feng Sheng was still loyal to him. However, your grandpa knew that Zhu Yuanzhang would kick out everyone he no longer needed, so he sent you away, and hoped you might live a peaceful life and stay away from the competition of the Imperial Court.

story_17311_1=<s>It's rumored that Shaolin strives to be overlord of the kung fu world. Wudang and Emei have announced their alliance against Shaolin.
story_17311_2=Well, a major battle is about to take place. Lin Tiannan has since gone to the Shaolin Temple.
story_17311_3=<s>Leader Xiao hopes you can go to Wudang for clarification, so that Beggar's Sect will avoid becoming the victim of any plot.
story_17312_1=<s>I won't rush to any conclusions here but in my opinion, Shaolin will never truly rule the martial arts world.
story_17312_2=<s>Wudang seem to have close ties with Emei. Why such an alliance?
story_17312_3=This is only getting worse. I'll need you to go and investigate immediately.
story_17327_1=I heard that the Shaolin are intending to take control of the martial arts world.
story_17327_2=<s>I see. You may go to find Hong Yanxin. I'm at the foot of the mountain and not well informed. You may go to find her and she will help you.
story_17328_1=The martial arts world is falling deeper and deeper into the hands of those evil factions. I suggest that we put our past differences aside for the time being, and focus on combating this evil.
story_17328_2=Now go to find Liang Shangyan and obtain some intelligence. I believe that he will weigh pros and cons to help you.
story_17330_1=<s>Well, I can tell you since you'll be killed by our Flag Leader.
story_17330_2=Hah, so that's the case. We don't know where Zhang Shihu is at all. The reason why we asked Delightful Forest to attack Wudang is that we intend to distract decent people, so that our Royal Guards can take the opportunity to conquer other sects.
story_17331_1=Hah, do you think you can escape from Luoyang City? Our Flag Leader has set a tight encirclement to prevent Wudang and Shaolin from reinforcing you. You don't have enough time!
story_17331_2=<s>Just witness the dominance of our Royal Guards in the world.
story_17332_1=Many ranked events have encouraged men to instigate various martial arts factions for their own personal ambitions.
story_17332_2=I'm fairly sure this was the work of the Royal Guards!
story_17333_1=<s>Overpowering drug? How much do you want? You know, it's expensive. Get out of here if you don't have money.
story_17333_2=<s>Life? I'm scared. Here you are if you want. I have a small business only, so let me go.
story_17333_3=<s>I failed to recognize you hero, please forgive me.
story_17333_4=<s>I'll get angry if you are still so polite to me.
story_17334_1=<s>Let's set off immediately, so that we can have the opportunity to overtake...
story_17334_2=<s>It's okay. Let's head for the Scholars respectively. No matter who first arrives, get Royal Guards entangled and wait for reinforcement.
story_17334_3=<s>Take care! I'll see you at the Scholars.
story_17335_1=You was ...at that time. My disciples once looked down upon you, but I didn't expect you would save the Scholars today. I feel ashamed of our own unseemliness...
story_17335_2=Diyun from Emei School? Has she come here? I'll immediately ask Dai Yushu for medicine. Wait for a while, please.
story_17336_1=<s>Didn't I assign someone to reinforce you at the Scholars? Didn't she tell you how to solve it?
story_17336_2=You're not qualified to teach me. Be gone!
story_17336_3=Go away as fast as you can!
story_17337_1=<s>I learnt that many Royal Guards have arrived in Suzhou. Since they provoked a battle in kung fu world, our Beggar's Sect will definitely punish these scums.
story_17337_2=<s>Previously I heard that you had met Royal Guards, so I came over to get information.
story_17337_3=<s>Why not let me know? Did you work with Royal Guards?
story_17338_1=<s>I'm sure that you're aware of the court's concern about the expansion of our martial arts factions.
story_17338_2=Well, the court seemed fully intent on eventually catching every single one of our martial artists. So perhaps this was just a prelude.

storymenu_17301_3=I see. I've obtained valuable information.
storymenu_17302_1=So that's the case.
storymenu_17302_2=Thanks for your guidance, Alliance Leader. I'm completely enlightened.
storymenu_17303_1=Do you still remember your name?
storymenu_17303_2=Why did you change so much?
storymenu_17303_3=I've admitted my mistake.
storymenu_17304_1=Oh, there is a story like this.
storymenu_17304_2=What!
storymenu_17305_1=Do you know the reason?
storymenu_17305_2=It's strange.
storymenu_17306_1=I once heard a source of the Imperial Court called Mr. Bai at Muyun Villa...
storymenu_17306_2=Leader, it's not too late...
storymenu_17306_3=I'm obliged to make my greatest efforts.
storymenu_17306_4=I will do it immediately!

storymenu_17308_1=Do you still want to defend yourself until now?
storymenu_17308_2=I didn't expect you could close your mouth tightly.
storymenu_17309_1=You mean I'll die in Yanjing?
storymenu_17309_2=Hah, that depends on their capability.
storymenu_17310_1=Who are you?
storymenu_17310_2=Why not tell me earlier? I thought you were dispatched by Royal Guards...
storymenu_17310_3=Today you can't judge someone by clothing only.
storymenu_17310_4=Please say.
storymenu_17311_1=What!
storymenu_17311_2=Why is it like this?
storymenu_17311_3=
storymenu_17312_1=What about Wudang and Emei?
storymenu_17312_2=What happened outside? So noisy?
storymenu_17312_3=I'll immediately go there to see what happened.
storymenu_17327_1=I see. I was assigned by Leader Xiao of Beggar's Sect to come over to see Tao-zhang Chongxu for details.
storymenu_17327_2=I will do it immediately!
storymenu_17328_1=So that's the case, err, make sense.
storymenu_17328_2=Thanks for your guidance, Taoist.
storymenu_17330_1=Where is Zhang Shihu? Why did you threaten Delightful Forest to attack Wudang?
storymenu_17330_2=A good stratagem to lure the enemy from his base.
storymenu_17331_1=Damn it! I won't let you succeed.
storymenu_17331_2=I'll find my way.
storymenu_17332_1=Who did it?
storymenu_17332_2=You're right, Taoist.
storymenu_17333_1=Life matters, shopkeeper. Why do you still behave like that?
storymenu_17333_2=...I'm not a bandit, why are you scared?
storymenu_17333_3=I'll give you money next time.
storymenu_17333_4=Right.
storymenu_17334_1=No, Miao Ying seemed to have set considerable secret devices. We had better act respectively.
storymenu_17334_2=Err, take care of yourself on the way, girl.
storymenu_17334_3=Make sense, do take care.
storymenu_17335_1=Leader Xiao, you're too modest. Now that Diyun was injured, does Leader Xiao have any good medicine?
storymenu_17335_2=Thank you.
storymenu_17336_1=Yes, I did. But the reason why I got angry was that you hurt your sister for your private purpose.
storymenu_17336_2=Hah, just go.
storymenu_17336_3=You should repent before it is too late!
storymenu_17337_1=I see…
storymenu_17337_2=Murong Weiyu is in Suzhou. Sorry, I can't tell you...
