storymenu_27322_1=I swear loyalty to the Beggar's Sect.
storymenu_27322_2=I saw and heard it myself. If I lie, I should be killed!
storymenu_27322_3=I remember!
storymenu_27380_2=We subordinates don't care about Deacon Qian's business.

storymenu_27561_1=I will beat you for sure.
storymenu_27562_1=So it is. Don't worry, Elder Brother, I will take revenge for you…Who is your enemy?
storymenu_27562_2=Elder Brother, are you OK?
storymenu_27563_1=Shifu, I drank with Shan Chong in the afternoon. He was drunk and couldn't wake up...
storymenu_27563_2=Elder Brother told his life story when he was drunk. I felt pity for him. I decided to get revenge for him. Shifu, can you tell me his life experience?
storymenu_27563_3=Oh, that accounts for it. Younger Brother says his father was killed for a legendary weapon. What weapon is he referring to?
storymenu_27564_1=Elder Brother, you seem worried. Tell me if you don't mind.
storymenu_27564_2=You can get revenge as long as Elder Shan helps you.
storymenu_27564_3=Isn't there any method?
storymenu_27564_4=If it was not for elder brother, I would have been hurt by Elder Shan. I will tell our leader.
storymenu_27620_1=Oh, do you know what they talked about?
storymenu_27620_2=Were there any sounds?
storymenu_27620_3=Don't cry, madam. I will get revenge for you.
storymenu_27621_1=Then what happened?
storymenu_27621_2=What's happening?

storymenu_27623_2=Oh, I also have heard about it.
storymenu_27623_3=I will call more friends. We won't suffer losses.
storymenu_27624_1=If you had done this, I wouldn't have beaten you. No need to change clothes. Watch your mouth!
storymenu_27624_2=No use, but harmful.
storymenu_27624_3=I barley beat you. Sorry, I will do the task for you.
storymenu_27625_1=Yes I heard about that.
storymenu_27625_2=Is it not dangerous for your lord to go there?
