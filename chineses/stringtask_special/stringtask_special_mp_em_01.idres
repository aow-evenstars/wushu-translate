dialogid_10014_3=I feel for Abbess Shuijing, but she has nothing to do with the crimes of her wayward son. The kindest thing you can do now is to have a last word with him before he dies.

story_10001_2=Did she…did she go away, too?
story_10001_3=(Sniff) I have some food. Take some.
story_10002_1=What a surprise. I've always known that Emei were murderers. Thank you for proving it.
story_10002_2=You're hypocrites. Wanderer's Valley will do anything and kill anyone to get what they want, but at least they're honest.
story_10002_3=You could have fooled me, girl. And where's my mother in all of this? Does she get the honor of executing her son?
story_10002_4=What? Do me a favor, Emei. Take me to see her before I die.
story_10003_2=Obviously, I will not be returning to Wanderer's Valley. Perhaps I will join the Beggar's Sect.
story_10007_1=I was not there to raise him. Cast out into the world alone, he was forced to find a safe place, and joined Wanderer's Valley.
story_10007_2=Perhaps not. But his life is in danger. If Yiluan truly believes I am responsible, let me die in his stead.
story_10009_1=What? D-did he say why?
story_10009_2=I left him at a convent to protect him from his father. I can only imagine that they failed him  in some way. My poor boy. This is all my fault! How could I have failed him so badly?
story_10010_3=Finally. Do you Emei usually starve your prisoners?
story_10010_4=I see. Why am I still alive, then?
story_10010_5=Really? An abbess? Ha! I should have known. Who else would have left me at that damned convent? And now she feels guilty because she betrayed her vows and had a son. To hell with her! What has she ever done for me?
story_10011_1=Oh, did those poor girls die from their wounds? What a shame.
story_10011_2=You don't frighten me. You call me a spy, even a philanderer, but there are those among you who actually welcomed me to their lonely beds!
story_10335_1=I'm afraid you just missed her. A strange disease is plaguing the nearby village, and she's gone there to tend the sick.
story_10335_2=The orphans under her charge are here. Why don't you keep them occupied for a while?
story_40052_1=You go on. I will stay behind to look after the South Abbey with the children.
story_40052_2=No, and that's all the more troubling. What fools would threaten the Emei within our very stronghold?
story_40054_2=Yes. Their clothes did not fit them. I would not be surprised if they were disguises of some sort.
story_40077_1=How is this possible?
story_40077_2=I see. This places me in a difficult position. Shuijing's son is guilty of espionage, kidnapping, assault and battery. By all laws of the land, he is to be summarily executed.
story_40078_1=I am glad you came to me. If Cui Yiluan is allowed to execute this man, Shuijing will blame herself. We must learn what kind of man this Ximen Fengliu is. Speak with him.
