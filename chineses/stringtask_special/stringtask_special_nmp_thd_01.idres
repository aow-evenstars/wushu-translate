They have no regard for authority, yet they would also capture evil-doers, bring them back to the island, deafen and mute them, and make them servants. As a result, bandits everywhere are terrified of the name of Peach Blossom Island. The main schools and factions all treat their disciples with the utmost respect.</font>
