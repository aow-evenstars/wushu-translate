DialogID_8751=There are of course ways of surviving in Jianghu. In the old days, the cultists dominated. However, they have long since retreated to the west. As any true warrior knows, you have to keep your friends close and your enemies closer, and the best offense is a good defense! It would be wise to befriend different factions wherever you can.

DialogID_8764=Our Lord Eunuch has been troubled recently, and he seems quite depressed. You know, he always enjoys a fine wine. Go fetch him a few jugs of Ling Wine. That will cheer him up.
DialogID_8765=Well? Do you have the wine?
DialogID_8767=Let me see what you are made of first! It would be a pity if you lost your life because you are unskilled. Our guard is in the garden. Defeat him.
DialogID_8768=I suppose it wouldn't hurt to tell you. This item is called Blood Kirin. It is actually a type of jade, and while it is a not a rare treasure, it is still relatively difficult to come by. The Empress's birthday is coming up soon! If we can't find this treasure, we will all be as good as dead!
DialogID_8769=Fortunately I just received news that a hermit called Dongfang Lin knows where to find this treasure. He often travels to Dongfang Village. I am counting on you to get this sorted out for me. if you are successful, you will be well rewarded.

DialogID_8784=You seem to mean business. I can tell you what you want to know, but you will need to do three things for me first, otherwise I won't tell you where the real Master Dongfang is. They say western wine, made from grapes, is a fine delicacy. How about you go get me some?
DialogID_8785=Wow! I can smell this wine from a mile away! I can't wait to have a taste!
DialogID_8786=Well then, how about you bring me 5 Beggar's Chicken, 5 Salted Duck, and 5 Braised Dongpo Pork?
DialogID_8788=I recently had a few unpleasant encounters with some local bandits. They are always causing me trouble. How about you go teach them a lesson for me?
DialogID_8789=Well, you certainly are punctual. I have more or less prepared all of the basic items.
DialogID_8790=Can't you see? They are rushing over here as we speak!
DialogID_8791=Very impressive! You managed to beat them with just a few moves!
DialogID_8792=Our Master likes the wild fruits that grow in the valley of Mount West. Go pick some and present them as a gift.
DialogID_8793=Who are you?
DialogID_8794=I have been formulating a rare medicine recently, but I am missing a crucial herb called Orient Vine. Please go find it for me!
DialogID_8795=This herb is very difficult to find! I am quite impressed that you have returned with it in such a short time.
DialogID_8796=Young man, do you have any news?
DialogID_8797=What do you want with me? If you have no business here, then leave!
DialogID_8798=Well... I can tell you, but it will depend on your skill. I don't need your money. What I need is your assistance in handling a few matters for me! The first thing you can do for me is to go teach that fellow at the next table a lesson. Just looking at him makes my eyes hurt!
DialogID_8799=Well kid, you do seem to know a thing or two about Kung Fu. There was a fellow who was fighting with me over a seat just a moment ago. Go teach him a lesson for me. Do this for me, and I will tell you what you want to know.
DialogID_8800=I have been waiting for you for quite some time. Did you bring what I asked for?
DialogID_8801=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Don't bother me with questions. Just bring this to the master.</font>

DialogID_8803=Ha ha! Are you awake now, kid?
DialogID_8804=Yes, yes, good! Kid, you have quite an impressive physique! I would even say that you have the potential to be a real martial artist someday! Ha! In the Rootless Clan, only hard work leads to success, and only the strongest will survive. Live or die, it's all up to you.
DialogID_8805=Before you see our lord, you must demonstrate your knowledge of our tenets. Are you ready to be tested?
DialogID_8806=Do you see the disciples who violated the rules in jail? One wrong move here and you are as good as dead! Go and execute them for me. You understand how to follow orders, don't you? Either they die, or you do! Ha ha ha! Oh, what am I saying? They will die regardless!
DialogID_8807=Here, take this knife. Do you see this person lying down over here? Ha ha! This is a process every disciple goes through. Your first task is to do the deed. Once you've finished, take this to Manager Wu at the Treasure House. Off with you! You know the consequence of refusing an order!
DialogID_8808=Well, kid, how does it feel to be castrated? Mmmm, yes. All Rootless Clan disciples have to go through this process. This is where we store our treasure. If you leave your treasure with me, it will always be safe. Heh heh! Our forefather's left a secret prescription that will ensure that our treasures last forever. According to Clan Rules, you are allowed to take one look at your treasure. Well, kid, do you want to take a look?
DialogID_8809=You have joined the Rootless Clan, and I have told you all that you need to know. I believe that you now have a firm grounding in what our clan stands for. The rest is up to you.
DialogID_8811={@0:Name}, now that you are here, let us begin immediately. All of you here are new disciples. There is only one rule for this challenge: defeat all of the disciples here. The last one left standing will be permitted to join the Inner Circle of Disciples, one of our clan's greatest honors.  Go! Prove your strength, and defeat them all!

DialogID_8813=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >It appears that you are more skilled than I thought! No wonder the clan sent a newcomer like you to come carry out this task. But this is only the beginning. The Rootless Clan will stop at nothing to accomplish their goals! You should never hesitate in the future. Always remember that nothing is more important than our lives.</font>
DialogID_8814=There are certain affairs in Jianghu that we cannot become directly involved. Hence, part of our strategy for accomplishing tasks includes seeking the assistance of others. But remember, you cannot trust anyone but yourself in this world.
DialogID_8815=There are some new prisoners in jail now. Go get some information from them. Show no mercy.
DialogID_8816=Well done.
DialogID_8817=Go light up the signal flare to let the disciples know to return.
DialogID_8818=I leave you to deal with the rest of this scum. Show me what you are made of. Show them no mercy. Go!
DialogID_8819=I am already aware of your performance on this task. You must understand that this is only the beginning! Challenges in the future will be far more cruel and harsh. I recommend that you prepare yourself accordingly!
DialogID_8820=The riverside flowers are redder than fire at sunrise. The green of the river's water in spring is almost blue—How can one not remember Suzhou? The ancients are so poetic! Why am I unable to perceive the world as they did? Huzzah! Now this is some good wine!  {@0:Name}, you have arrived so quickly! You really know me!
DialogID_8821=Thank you for rescuing me! These bandits commit murder without a second thought. I was nearly finished…they are here!
DialogID_8822={@0:Name}, I have been waiting for you!
DialogID_8823=I know all about what happened. You really did well this time. Every new disciple goes through this process after joining the Rootless Clan. It is the only way you can grow!

DialogID_8825=Take the Rootless Clan disciples with you and eradicate Golden Needle Sect.

DialogID_8882=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >So?</font>

DialogID_8950=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The Rootless Clan's spy network is widespread and deeply entrenched. I do not expect you to fully understand its intricate nature.

DialogID_8952=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >This is a provocation! A bloody provocation! We need to investigate this matter properly. It might not have been your fault, but you were there, so if you can't find the truth of the matter, </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >you will pay with your life!</font>
DialogID_8953=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Who are you? Why are you here? Get the hell out of my sight!</font>
DialogID_8954=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ha ha! Spies! I knew that we were infiltrated by spies long ago, but I can't root them out until they make a mistake and reveal themselves.

DialogID_8957=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >This guy? He's all yours. See if you can squeeze </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >the truth</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > out of him.</font>
DialogID_8959=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Feng Changhen? A few months ago, I don't know why, but he went into the Treasure House while I was away. Then he nervously bumped into me on his way out and was looking rather suspicious. Could it be that he intends to betray the Rootless Clan?</font>
DialogID_8960=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I always have treated Feng Changhen well! And this, this is how he repays me!</font>
DialogID_8962=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >All... All of our outer strongholds... They've all been raided... The Imperial Court... The Court is trying to eradicate the clan...!</font>
DialogID_8963=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Nobody outside of the Rootless Clan has any knowledge of our outer strongholds! Feng Changhen! Disciples! Leave me now, all of you!  Capture Feng Changhen and bring him to me! I will make him beg for death for his betrayal!</font>
DialogID_8965=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You ask why? Ha ha ha! Wei Wuyan? That castrated bastard killed my mother! If I had not been rescued by them, I would just have been another soul lost under the blade of that bastard Wei. I want him to die! I want to send him and everything he stands for straight to hell! </font>
DialogID_8967=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What did you say? There will be great changes in the clan? Now is no time for games and small talk! This is a serious matter!</font>
DialogID_8968=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Lord Wei decided to wage open war in Jianghu? Ha ha ha! I think you've had too much to drink.</font>
DialogID_8992=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Even so, you must keep a low profile and watch your step. Don't throw away your life over a petty matter.  If you do your tasks properly, you will enjoy endless riches for the rest of your life. Our clan's martial arts skills are powerful and profound. If you are willing to work hard, you will reach the top of Wulin sooner or later!</font>
DialogID_8994=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Amitabha! Oh, merciful Buddha, you will become a demon!</font>
DialogID_8995=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ha ha ha! I see you understand the way of the sword, but I want to see if you have the nerve to kill. Go now. Find and slay a real Jianghu expert.</font>
DialogID_8999=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >But the Rootless Clan makes a clear distinction between rewards and punishments. If you do something wrong, don't blame us for being harsh! Go to the foreman now and tell him who you are. He will make all further arrangements for you.</font>

interactinfo_8952=I think I saw <a href="findnpc_new,city03,Event_npc_wgm_cc_8952" style="HLStype1">Feng Changhen</a> just now. What should I do now?! If I go back I will be flayed alive! Let me go see if he can help me.
interactinfo_8953=I have no idea where to start investigating. Let me go see if Foreign Consul <a href="findnpc_new,school11,wgm_007" style="HLStype1">Lord Li </a>can help me.
interactinfo_8954=This is no small matter. These cloth scraps and silver pieces might have been left behind intentionally by the informer when he was killed! Could a spy be involved? I should return with haste to report this to <a href="findnpc_new,school11,wgm_007" style="HLStype1">Lord Li</a>.
interactinfo_8955=Ah? I really did see Elder Brother Feng here just now. How could he have disappeared? Never mind, I still need to report back to the clan. Let me go to <a href="findnpc_new,city03,Event_npc_wgm_cc_8955" style="HLStype1">the place where I was ambushed</a> to see if I can find some evidence that will clear my name.
interactinfo_8956=Spreading a rumor is a way to catch the infiltrator. I will go to the <a href="findnpc_new,school11,Event_npc_wgm_cc_8956" style="HLStype1">courtyard </a>and see if I can catch him.
interactinfo_8958=It appears that the Traitor has nothing useful to say. Since our "bait" is already on the hook, the "big fish" should be following us in no time.

interactinfo_8965=<a href="findnpc_new,city03,npc_wgm_cc_004" style="HLStype1">He</a> is still here! Why did he do such a thing to destroy the clan and dishonor the brotherhood! (Use Flying Skill to go up the high ladder and over the wall to the Drum Tower.)
interactinfo_8966=Ah? Why does the top of this <a href="findnpc_new,school11,GatherNpc_wgm_cc_8952" style="HLStype1">treasure jar</a> look slightly different?
interactinfo_8967=If the traitor continues to lay low, there is not much I can do. Perhaps we could find a way to smoke him out somehow?  Go find some <a href="findnpc_new,school11,wgm_sw002" style="HLStype1">disciples</a> and spread the word.
interactinfo_8968=If the traitor hears of such major news, he will surely go and send on the information? Allow me to add fuel to the fire! Go to <a href="findnpc_new,school11,wgm_sw006" style="HLStype1">Blood Palace</a> and continue "fishing."

story_8750_1=What do you want? You must be kidding me, right?
story_8750_2=I knew you were afraid! So what are you going to do, then?
story_8750_3=Ha ha! You sure are a sweet talker. I have no need for riches. I just want our Master Diao to get through this current crisis.
story_8750_4=So you're a divinator. Are you an immortal, or a fraud?
story_8751_1=You are intelligent as well as diligent. Perhaps there is something you can do for me after all.
story_8751_2=I need to consult Master Diao on this matter.
story_8751_3=Go seek Master Diao. He will tell you what to do.
story_8752_1=This all began a long time ago. Back then, Chen Youliang was one of the great warriors of his age, but he was unscrupulous in his actions. In order to amass funds for the army, he had many old tombs and crypts of previous dynasties dug up and looted. The Blood Kirin was one of the treasures he found in those tombs, and he liked it so much that kept it for himself. After they were defeated, this Blood Kirin fell into the hands of Zhang Shicheng, but in the end, even Zhang Shicheng...
story_8752_2=After Zhang Shicheng was defeated, no one knew where this object disappeared to, but legend has it that the object was passed down to Zhang Shicheng's descendants. But Zhang Shicheng's descendants are all spread out, and many have gone into hiding or become hermits. Very few people know their whereabouts now.
story_8752_3=There is hope for its recovery. It was said that a branch of the Zhang's descendants escaped to Suzhou, and stayed in seclusion near Tai Lake. But they seldom come out, and very little information is known about them. If you go to Suzhou, you can find more information.
story_8752_4=No need to thank me. That rogue Dongfang Lin must have caused you much trouble! Just think of it as an apology on behalf of that scoundrel! Go now!
story_8753_1=When Zhang was defeated, his relatives fled in all directions. The Blood Kirin is likely passed on to his descendants.
story_8753_2=Now that we know what happened to the Blood Kirin, I am going to ask you to continue carrying out this task. I will tell Little Mo to wait for you at the largest tavern in Jinling for your news. Once you have returned, I will report your success to the Emperor. You will be well rewarded.
story_8755_1=Yes, hail hail and all that.
story_8755_2=Ha ha! Now you only have two choices. Either you join the Rootless Clan or you can die a miserable death!
story_8755_3=Ultimate power. Greater than material wealth, greater than all mortal pleasures.
story_8755_4=To join the Rootless Clan, you need to sever all ties with the past. Castration - total relinquishment - is your first step!
story_8756_1=Now, I am one of the few old ones who remains behind in the Rootless Clan. According to tradition, I should tell you newcomers some old tales. The history of the Rootless Clan is always passed down by word of mouth from the old to the young. So, you newcomers listen up, and listen well! If you don't want to listen anymore, just tell me and I will carry on next time.
story_8756_2=Ha ha! I really like you, lad. Allow me to begin: The Rootless Clan has existed for over a thousand years. However, we have always been a small clan. The Rootless Clan has seen many illustrious characters in its ranks throughout the ages. Some were famed for generations, while others were infamous and had their names cursed for centuries. But it matters not what kind of people they were—they were all great and powerful in their own way. It is not my place to say what they did was right or wrong, and neither is it your place as disciples to judge them. In the Rootless Clan, those who live the longest are those who say the least. My lad, remember this important truth. Don't ever say that I didn't warn you.
story_8756_3=As long as you understand. Now, where was I? Ah, yes! Illustrious men of yore! You see, my memory is not as good as it once was. Now, allow me to continue. These illustrious men were the founding fathers of the Rootless Clan. Their portraits are placed in places of honor in the treasury, and the rules say that newcomers must pay their respects. If you have time, you should honor this tradition. Though I suppose it is just a formality and not strictly required... Ha ha.
story_8756_4=So, even though we cannot walk around proudly in the light of day, we are still people. We might have no more emotions and desires, so there is nothing more to complain about and it is too late for regrets. The only truism now is to live, as you are now in the Rootless Clan. Understand and embrace your fate. Although outsiders might look down on us, you must never look down on yourself. Think about it for a while, and you will see the wisdom behind these words.
story_8756_5=So this is it. Follow the rules and you will have a chance to advance. In the Rootless Clan, we look at those who can prove themselves. I just stay behind here to guard these treasures because I have no skills. But you are still young. You still have plenty of opportunities. Very well I am tired now from talking so much. Let's stop today. Go find that kid Zhao Wuji and see what arrangements he has made for you. Obey the rules and most of all, stay alive! Ha ha! Kid, I can see that you are impatient. Let me tell you a little secret: I heard that the there is a secret healing Skill in the Golden Needle Sect. Their healing skill can mend broken limbs and even grow them back. That means that, if preserved properly, this skill could restore our manhood. I am old now, and there is not much hope. But you, you are still young. Ha ha, lad! Don't tell anyone else. Go try it when you have the opportunity. Your "treasure" will remain here. I will do my best to keep it safe for you. Go now!
story_8757_1=Immortals know not the taste of wine! They only know of fragrance, not of pain! If Immortals don't know the taste of wine, how could a mere mortal ever understand its true meaning? Ha ha!
story_8757_2=Hmmm. But Younger Brother is a mortal who really understands. Ah, such fine wine in front of me! It would be a shame if we didn't drink a cup! Come, have a drink with me! What do you say?
story_8757_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Bah! Rules are only to keep stupid people in line. Don't take everything so seriously! Wine is my lifeblood! If I had to go a single day without wine, I would surely die! Well, if you insist, then forget about it. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I will not</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > force you</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >.</font>
story_8758_1=If you enter the Rootless Clan alive, it will be hard to return dead. There is no going back. I hope you have not regretted your decision.
story_8759_1=Seek comfort from the wine cup. {@0:Name}, it would be a pity if you didn't have a drink! Come, come! Sit down and rest a while. Just wait for me to finish this drink, will you?
story_8759_2=What's the rush? Why not sit and listen to the whole story from beginning to end?
story_8759_3=You know the founding and way of survival of the Rootless Clan. Under the rule of the Emperor, we have to find a niche in order to survive. It has taken considerable skill to survive for as long as we have.  I will not go in to the details, but currently there is some unrest with the Imperial power, now is the best time for the Rootless Clan to grow and develop. The imperial court is currently divided between Prince Zhu Gaochi's Huaixi Gang and Prince Zhu Gaoxu's Zhe Gang. The two have been fighting back and forth out in the open and behind closed doors for years. The military officials back Zhu Gaoxu, while the Royal Guards, which betrayed the court long ago, back Zhu Gaochi. But then there is Zhu Gaosui, who has been holding back, biding his time. Nobody knows his real power. Now East Chamber has been wavering between the three princes, Zhu Gaochi, Zhu Gaoxu, and Zhu Gaosui. If the Rootless Clan is to take advantage from this situation, any obstacles in the way must be removed...and these three princes are the source of the obstacles.
story_8759_4=The court is currently divided between Prince Zhu Gaochi's Huaixi Gang and Prince Zhu Gaoxu's Zhe Gang. Also, the theft of the Imperial steel happened on the territory of Zhu Gaoxu's Zhe Gang. Governor Zhou Wutong of the Zhe Gang has been imprisoned for his incompetence in solving this case. If we are to let the battle become more incensed between these two rival gangs, then this man must be killed!
story_8759_5=Right, but now you have something more important to take care of. A Jianghu wanderer named Yan Lingyun will be going to Suzhou. What you need to do is to first gain his trust. We will let you know what to do next when the time is right.
story_8760_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ah... This is a long story. I passed through here few days ago while bandits were pillaging the village. I could not stand to sit by and watch, so I began fighting with them. In the end, I killed their leader and the rest of them ran off.</font>
story_8760_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >{@0:Name}, very astute of you. I found out later that the lieutenant I killed was the bandit leader's only son. They will be after me to seek vengeance. I have been pursued by these rogues for the past few days, and I have many injuries.</font>
story_8760_3=It is very embarrassing, but if it were not for the trials of the past few days, these ruffians would never have been able to touch me.
story_8760_4={@0:Name}, I can see that you are also a chivalrous man. Seeing as you saved my life, what would you say about us becoming friends?
story_8761_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >So it appears you have gained his trust! This man is the most crucial piece of the puzzle. You would do well to take as much advantage of him as you can. Remember, do not give into leniency or show any mercy.</font>
story_8761_2=I know that you are well aware of the rules of the Rootless Clan. It would be quite a shame to see you throw away your life for such a worthless pursuit. You are different than the other disciples. You will go further than I.
story_8761_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Your next task is to help break someone out of jail tonight. The person you are rescuing is named Tie Le. He is also a hero of Jianghu. But when you get there, you will only see a corpse. As for the details of what you will need to do... Well, you are a bright one, aren't you? I don't think I need to spell it out for you.</font>
story_8762_1={@0:Name}, you are very frank! Let us sit down and chat! Brother, I noticed that you are not a local. May I ask why you are in Suzhou? If you need, you can use my place, don't be shy!
story_8762_2=Who is your Elder Brother, and where is he now?
story_8762_3=So it is Wind Iron Claw Tie Le. I have heard of him before. There are many stories of his good deeds in Jianghu. But it was said that he disappeared. I never thought he was thrown into the Governor's jail in Suzhou. Brother, are you here to rescue your Elder Brother?
story_8762_4=So do you have a proper plan yet? Do you know how you are going to rescue your Elder Brother?
story_8762_5=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >...Alright, Brother. You saved my life once before, and I was unsure how to repay you. Let me come with you and help you rescue your Elder Brother. Since Wind Iron Claw Tie Le is a Jianghu hero, I cannot stand idly by and do nothing. I will come with you tonight!</font>
story_8762_6=I am quite familiar with the Suzhou Governor residence. Tonight I will wait for you by the wall behind the jail.
story_8763_1=Let us leave this place now, lest we attract trouble! I am very sorry about your Elder Brother.
story_8763_2=If we go together, we will be too obvious. We need to go on separately. Afterwards, when the authorities investigate this matter, we should each find a place to hide. I am sure we will meet again someday!
story_8764_1=You did the job well, but I can see the hesitation in your eyes! You must understand, you cannot trust anyone! You cannot have any feelings or hesitation, or it will cost you your life one day!
story_8764_2=From the day we join the Rootless Clan, we must sever all worldly emotions. Only by being cold-blooded and ruthless can we live longer. Alright, think about it yourself. We have already lost everything. Our lives are the only thing we have left. Never forget this!
story_8764_3=Alright, most of the soldiers' attention at the Suzhou prison have been diverted there, they should be more lax in other places.
