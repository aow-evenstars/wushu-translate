DialogID_1177=<s>I know why you're here…we've been betrayed! Assassins, draw your blades!
DialogID_1178=<s>You look like you know a thing or two, but we'll just have wait and see, don't we?
DialogID_1179=You must warn the Yanmen about the Xingxiu Sect! They will surely strike again!
DialogID_1181=<s>We believe you. You can go in now.
DialogID_1183=<s>Your kung fu is excellent, let me give you three monk's robes and a token.
DialogID_1185=<s>You must be new here. You look unfamiliar to me. Send this account book to the Immortal.
DialogID_1190=<s>I'll handle Nangong Chou. Go find Nangong Jun at the Luoyang Inn.
DialogID_1192=<s>Those thugs from Mang Mountain are bullying my boys. Can you stop them?
DialogID_1193=<s>So he's trying to leave me by giving me this snapped zither string? Here is a mended string, then, for you to take back to him.
DialogID_1194=<s>So I stole it. What are you going to do about it? Guards, remove this pest!
DialogID_1195=<s>Your kung fu is great. Take this stolen musical composition "Phoenix".
DialogID_1197=<s>Please stay away…I beg you…
DialogID_1199=That frightened woman is my fiancee. I'm here to gather some medicinal herbs for her.
DialogID_1201=<s>Why don't you run at the sight of me? Aren't you afraid?
DialogID_1202=<s>You moron. You're fooled. Come and fight him, all of you.
DialogID_1203=<s>Youming Palace has the antidote to save that woman. Get going!
DialogID_1205=Take the letter, and put on the Emissary's clothes. That should help you get past the guards.
DialogID_1206=
DialogID_1207=This is Youming Palace. State your name and purpose!
DialogID_1208=<s>Go see the Second Palace Leader, Emissary.
DialogID_1209=<s>Welcome to Youming Palace, Emissary. Please show me the letter from your leader.
DialogID_1210=<s>He counts for nothing. He can't ruin our plans.
DialogID_1211=<s>You're here. Since we've agreed to cooperate with you, I want to know how you will realize the conditions Secret Association promised us.
DialogID_1212=You should have killed my subordinates. You won't leave this place alive.
DialogID_1214=<s>Are you going to the Big Tomb? I need to know...
DialogID_1216=<s>I yield. Your skills are excellent. Where did you learn them?
DialogID_1218=<s>You've won. Why have you spared me?
DialogID_1219=<s>How come I have never seen you? You're new here?
DialogID_1220=<s>I don't know how to go through Tongues of Fire with two barrels of oil, either. Perhaps he did it on purpose. Now you can only think it over and figure out a way by yourself.
DialogID_1221=<s>How is it? Have you got any good idea?
DialogID_1222=of course, I wouldn't always make people awkward as those old fogeys. But I need your help. I have little wood here. It takes a lot of wood to make wood man secret device. Go to the tomb entrance and fetch some.
DialogID_1223=<s>Not bad. You've got 70% of my martial arts skills at such a young age.
DialogID_1224=<s>I can't force him, even though I'm the headmaster. Tell him it's his decision.
DialogID_1225=<s>Just now a man in black came over. I found and fought with him, but he ran away. You go around to have a check. See whether there is something suspicious.
DialogID_1227=<s>I see. I'll go and close the tomb door immediately. Ask Secret Device Mechanism Masters to be defensive. Han Zhixin is still investigating outside. You ask her not to take actions by herself.
DialogID_1228=<s>I'll handle it carefully. You go back to tell Headmaster we're ready.
DialogID_1229=<s>I spied it out. Only a few enemies hav ecome this time. You go and kill all of them.
DialogID_1230=<s>Well done. All the dangers are gone. You ignite the fireworks bullet, so everybody will know. You must have reported it to Headmaster last night.
DialogID_1231=<s>Not bad Kung Fu, little brat. Take this feather arrow. You give it to the Engineer as the symbol you passed this round.
DialogID_1232=<s>You did it quite well. You pass. Take this iron nail to the Quicksand Mechanician.
DialogID_1233=<s>You just said that because you didn't want to offend me. Take this jar of sand to the flame mechanic. You pass this round.
DialogID_1234=<s>You little brat. Forget it. I'll let you pass. You take this Small Wood Beast to Master of Wood Man Secret Device.
DialogID_1235=I'm relieved to see you dispatched the dangers you encountered on the way. Tell your elder I have to talk with him.
DialogID_1236=Ok. No more business. Go and see Headmaster. She is under the stone statue in the hall.
DialogID_1237=Generally speaking it's not bad. But don't use too much force in real practice of martial arts skills. It's better to combine strength with grace and show your skills step by step. You had better go and find Headmaster. Tell her my decision.
DialogID_1238=Is it true? Go and tell Headmaster.
DialogID_1239=The Silent Temple is here, so we can't ignore them. Tell the headmaster. I'll leave the Ancient Tomb to help Dongfang family.
DialogID_1240=I see. Just now Silver Blade Guard Dragon Teeth came to report. You go and ask him what it is.

QiecuoTitle_1179=<s>I shall avenge my brothers!
QiecuoTitle_1182=You know too much. I'm sorry, but you must die.
QiecuoTitle_1184=<s>Come on. Let me see what you're capable of.
QiecuoTitle_1188=<s>You're pretty good...for an amateur. Let me show you what a real fighter can do.
QiecuoTitle_1192=<s>Behold, the power of the Youming! Die!
QiecuoTitle_1193=Whoever you are, you'll have to get past me first!
QiecuoTitle_1198=<s>Come on, don't pull any punches!
QiecuoTitle_1199=Don't hold back just because I'm an old woman. Ready?

story_1175_1=<s>Don't kill me…I'm a Xingxiu disciple! I'll tell you everything I know!
story_1175_2=<s>Our assassins are planning an ambush against the Yanmen Family.
story_1176_1=<s>The traitor among the Yanmen is Chu Hongfei. He joined the Xingxiu Sect.
story_1176_2=<s>Do what you will with that traitor, but I want you to go to his Shifu, Yan Guhong. Find out what he knows.
story_1177_1=<s>A Shaolin Monk barged in here, and injured my people. What other explanation is there?
story_1177_2=<s>Yes, do that, and watch yourself. You saw how we Yanmen dealt with spies.
story_1178_1=<s>My grandson was bitten by a Ripple-Eye Krait. Only White Grass can get rid of the poison.
story_1178_2=<s>Thank you. Please also get rid of those pests, so they won't hurt anyone again.
story_1179_1=<s>Old Man Lucky is a superb martial artist, but he is very reclusive, never accepting a disciple until you came along.
story_1179_2=<s>Luck has nothing to do with it. It's your motivation and perseverance that moved him. You must really want to learn from him!
story_1180_1=<s>Can't I learn from you?
story_1180_2=<s>There's more? How long is this going to take…
story_1181_1=<s>You needn't know who I am. There is a chance we will meet gain.
story_1181_2=<s>I've known that you are Old Man Lucky's disciple for quite some time. I came to offer you aid, but you were the one who helped me.
story_1182_1=<s>Founded by Chaoying, the Ancient Tomb Sect accepts only female disciples. A man can enter the Sect grounds only if a disciple has pledged her life to him.
story_1182_2=<s>Why do you want to go there? If you have a good reason, I may just make an exception for you.
story_1183_1=<s>Thank you for recovering my bracelet. It's very important to me.
story_1183_2=<s>My parents abandoned me when I was a child. The headmaster took me in and trained me. He said I was wearing this bracelet when he found me.
story_1184_1=<s>Do you know what I do as an Engineer?
story_1184_2=<s>You're right, but there's a lot more to it than you can possibly know.
story_1185_1=<s>You overcame his Flying Arrow. If I can defeat you, it'll be proof that my Quicksand Attack is superior.
story_1185_2=<s>So, not willing to challenge me, eh? Then tell me which is the better skill, his Flying Arrow or my Quicksand?
story_1186_1=<s>What happened to the Dongfangs?
story_1186_2=<s>Why don't you ask Yang Xie for help? The Dongfangs once trusted the Ancient Tomb Sect; perhaps you can rekindle their  goodwill.
story_1187_1=<s>Ill-tempered as Yang Xie may be, he and the head of the Dongfang household were once as close as brothers.
story_1187_2=<s>The Dongfangs once held a grand banquet, but failed to invite Yang Xie. He bore a grudge against them ever since.
story_menu_1175=Now you must tell me the truth. Who on earth are you?
story_menu_1176=Please tell me what happened.
story_menu_1177=Your traitor is dead. Now, tell me what happened.
story_menu_1178=Are you all right?
story_menu_1179=Alliance Leader, could you tell me about it?
story_menu_1180=I'll tell you what I know, so pay attention!
story_menu_1181=How do you know my background? Who are you?
story_menu_1182=Let me tell you about the Ancient Tomb Sect.
story_menu_1183=Do you know the origin of the bracelet?
story_menu_1184=Please feel free to ask whatever you like, Elder.
story_menu_1185=Do you also want to test me, Elder?
story_menu_1186=Hope you can help us, Headmaster.
story_menu_1187=Is there anything else you can tell me about Yang Xie?

storymenu_1175_2=This is bad…we have to do something!
storymenu_1176_1=What are you going to do with him, Leader?

storymenu_1179_1=I suppose I was lucky, then.
storymenu_1179_2=I do.
storymenu_1180_1=Have you condsidered joining the Shaolin? Their martial arts are second to none.
storymenu_1180_2=If you don't want to continue, we'll stop right now.
storymenu_1181_1=How do you know I'm the disciple of Old Man Lucky?
storymenu_1181_2=This is what I should do.
storymenu_1182_1=That does not sound very promising.
storymenu_1182_2=Silent Temple is ready to attack, and the Dongfang family doesn't stand a chance by themselves, so I'm here to ask you for help.
storymenu_1183_1=What is the matter?
storymenu_1183_2=You have my sympathy.
storymenu_1184_1=Aren't they pits dug out with machines and tools to ambush enemies?
storymenu_1184_2=If you say so.
storymenu_1185_1=I have no doubt that you are the superior fighter.
storymenu_1185_2=Quicksand, of course. It is harder to block.
storymenu_1186_1=Do not blame the Beggar's Sect. The Dongfang Family's true enemies are the Silent Temple and the Youming Palace!
storymenu_1186_2=Very well, I'll find him.
storymenu_1187_1=Why couldn't House Dongfang get along with the Ancient Tomb Sect, if their leaders knew each other so well?
storymenu_1187_2=I see.
