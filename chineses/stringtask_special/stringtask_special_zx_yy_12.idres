
DialogID_3376=Humph! You are the helper of Flying Eagle Stockade!
DialogID_3377=Oh yes! Isn't this the champion of the Challenge Pass Meeting of Heroes. Thank goodness, we are saved now! A box of gold and silver that my Guild had accumulated so many years was stolen by a thief. I hope that you can help us get it back.
DialogID_3378=I shouldn't have troubled you. But if you don't drive away Wandering Doctors outside the city, Prairie Wolf Guild and the medicinal merchants in the city will go out of business. Please help us.
DialogID_3379=What are you Han people doing at Flying Eagle Stockade?
DialogID_3380=Hehe, hmmm...My First Leader is temporarily absent, but my third leader is here and he is injured, you should go to him!
DialogID_3381=Thank you for your help. My elder brother has just returned, please go to him!
DialogID_3382=We've got the news too. You're welcome. I've asked the military advisor Sai Quzhong to gather up troops and ready to set off. Go to him!
DialogID_3383=Hey! Good that you showed up, they are fighting over the leadership. Go stop them!
DialogID_3384=What.....You are one of Han people?
DialogID_3385=Who are you? How dare you break into my royal camp!
DialogID_3386=I....I....
DialogID_3387=Heroes successfully killed many Mongolian soldiers and also killed Khan's brother Yi Zhixie, they have now withdrawn to the border town.
DialogID_3388=Oh no...A gang of jianghu rivals ambushed our camp when we were attacking the royal court. Please come help us.
DialogID_3389=Help us out! Some ferocious bandits also took the opportunity and plundered our jewelry and satins. Please help us!
DialogID_3390=I can do nothing. You send a letter by pigeon to let Qin Lu closely monitor the movement of the Royal Court, and then rush over. I'll follow with more people.
DialogID_3392=It was Qin Lu who sent me here. You killed a fake emperor's teacher. The real teacher has imprisoned Khan, and is consolidating the troops and preparing for invading the south area.
QiecuoMenu_3376=Unreasonable...
QiecuoMenu_3378=So impolite! Let me check your skill.
QiecuoMenu_3382=Hehe, come over and catch me!
QiecuoMenu_3383=Oh, Lets see who will die first.
QiecuoMenu_3385=You have a good taste.
QiecuoTitle_3376=Huh! That beating wasn't enough for you? How dare you show up here again.
QiecuoTitle_3378=How stupid! Nobody of the Prairie Wolf Guild is good. Sai Quzhong used his tricks and many of our brothers were dead because of him. Reconciliation with them is impossible. Let me knock your tiny head down first.
QiecuoTitle_3382=It's You...Since you are here, I will kill you for the reward.
QiecuoTitle_3383=What an arrogant Han people, I'll tribute you to the flag first.
QiecuoTitle_3385=Watch my Special Move...

okmenu_3377=<font face="Default" color="#000000" >It doesn't have to be that way. I'll just try it. </font><br/>
okmenu_3378=You are welcome. Leave it to me.
okmenu_3379=I'm here to mediate Flying Eagle Stockade and Prairie Wolf Guild. Please go inform your leader.
okmenu_3380=Haha, now can I go to your leader now?
okmenu_3381=Fine, take care!
okmenu_3382=Very good. We must not let these of barbarians set foot into the Central Plains.
okmenu_3383=Well, I got this.
okmenu_3384=Be honest. Don't play tricks and tell me where your emperor's teacher is?
okmenu_3385=Arggggh!!! I'm here to take your disgrace life.
okmenu_3386=(Finally killed the scourge.)
okmenu_3387=Great. I'll go find them. See you later.
okmenu_3388=You're welcome.
okmenu_3389=Crap! I'll be right there.
okmenu_3390=Well, that's the only way.
okmenu_3392=Do you have something for me?
story_3376_1=What? You are a passerby? I thought you were from Flying Eagle Stockade. We Prairie Wolf Guild just ambushed Flying Eagle Stockade, so we strengthened the security in case they revenge...
story_3376_2=Well... There are two big forces in our city. The stronger ones are our Prairie Wolf Guild, and Flying Eagle Stockade outside the city. We used to live in peace with each other until some Wandering Doctors came to the city and took our local businesses. So we went out several times to drive them away, but Flying Eagle Stockade thought that we were going to invade their territory. So both sides started to fight.
story_3377_1=King Wula Hutai of Katata is weak and incompetent without the support from General Hua Linglie. Some time ago, the emperor's teacher and Wula Hutai's younger brother Yi Zhixie launched rebellion, drove away Hua Linglie and captured King Wula Hutai.
story_3377_2=Now Siri Gule and Yi Zhixie have joined tribal militant force. They are planning to invade the Central Plains. We must disrupt their plan and the only way to do so is by killing Siri Gule and Yi zhixie. Go and seek some help.
story_3378_1=Hey! I just got the bad news. The emperor's teacher is so sneaky. We celebrated too early! I have asked the military advisor to gather up soldiers, however...
story_3378_2=During the halfway of our feast, all the soldiers suddenly suffered severe diarrhea. Everyone rushed to the latrine. And now most of them can't even get stand up right. We're unable to go to war now.
story_3379_1=I am the general of the Katata tribe, Hua Xianglie! Humph! Today, I have fell into your Han people's hands, and if you want to kill me, do it. I will never beg you to spare my life.
story_3379_2=Humph! If it wasn't for the sinister emperor's teacher Siri Gule's trick, I would never get captured. I have lost to Siri Gule, not to you Han people.
story_menu_3376=How dare you be so presumptuous with so weak skills. I'm only passing by. Why do you attack me?
story_menu_3377=Qin Lu, I didn't expect to meet you here. It is said that the King of Katata is arranging his troops and may invade the Central Plains soon. Now tell me about the specific situation.
story_menu_3378=The emperor's teacher that I killed turned out to be a fake one.

storymenu_3376_2=The two sides clashed for a small profit.
storymenu_3377_1=Rain
storymenu_3377_2=OK, that's fine.
