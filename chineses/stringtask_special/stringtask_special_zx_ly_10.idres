
DialogID_13226=Hurry up and chase. Find her in the Dongfang Family. Take my name card with you to meet Dongfang Zhoncheng.
DialogID_13227=Do you mind sharing your concern? Maybe I will have some ideas.
DialogID_13228=I'm just guessing. It's broken. I'm not sure.
DialogID_13229=Great, you are powerful. Now I don't have to worry if I let you handle this case. Find Yan Changkong hidden near Youyuan Cave. Discuss details with him about how to rescue the scholar disciples in trouble.
DialogID_13230=I know your stories. Thank you so much for saving my younger sister and bringing back my marriage token. I've send the order to Yanmen Family that even though you are from Wanderers Valley, we should not harm you.
DialogID_13231=It's easy to defeat me. If you can defeat Qin Xuanqi, then you will be considered good.
DialogID_13232=Your internal power is strong, but you lack in experience and actual move execution. If you duel with others in hard core, you probably will win. If you encounter some sneaky rivals, you will have a hard time.
DialogID_13233=Thank you.
DialogID_13234=Our Little Saintess Wen Xinluo is also kidnapped by the pirates. She is probably locked up in the cave right now. You should go find Yan Changkong to discuss plans.
DialogID_13235=We pirates and the robbers have hatred. If you can go give them a lesson, I will think about setting the hostage free.
DialogID_13236=Who are you? What do you want to do?
DialogID_13237=I merely pass by here.
DialogID_13239=The letter says the Mysterious Clan already send their people to Scholar and want to control Scholar. There must be spies among us.
DialogID_13240=It's the last method we could try.
DialogID_13241=You are from Mysterious Clan? Any proof?
DialogID_13242=Hi, how is it going?
DialogID_13243=Are the pirates defeated?
DialogID_13244=Dongfang Zhi? How could it be?
DialogID_13245=I've loved Yan Changkong since long ago. To stop his wedding with Yi Ruoxun, I took away their marriage token.
DialogID_13246=Here is the recovered secret script. It is indeed the Blood Sea Demon Blade Record.
DialogID_13247=What's this? Why do you hide a piece of broken cloth? I've been outside for long. I get to go home. If you are free in future, visit me in the Dongfang Family.
DialogID_13248=This secret script is very important. If the evil get it, it will be troublesome.
DialogID_13249=This secret script is very important. If the evil get it, it will cause huge issue.
QiecuoMenu_13226=Show your full potential.
QiecuoMenu_13227=You are strong, but I'm stronger.
QiecuoMenu_13228=Okay.
QiecuoMenu_13231=So full of yourself.
QiecuoMenu_13236=I'll kill anyone who stop me.
QiecuoMenu_13237=I am not the man in black.
QiecuoMenu_13244=I'm killing you.
QiecuoTitle_13226=I'm ready.
QiecuoTitle_13227=It's just a duel.
QiecuoTitle_13228=Let's duel.
QiecuoTitle_13231=You are so weak. Let me give you a lesson.
QiecuoTitle_13236=Ask the girl over there to come out. Otherwise, I will kill you.
QiecuoTitle_13237=What do you mean?
QiecuoTitle_13244=You killed so many of my followers. I'll kill you all and revenge.
