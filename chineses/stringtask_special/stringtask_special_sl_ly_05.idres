DialogID_38840=<s>You are talented in martial arts. The Yanmen Family favors long boxing and some of us have learned Long Style Boxing. Want to practice?
DialogID_38842=<s>I have noticed some suspicious people outside the villa recently. They look like they are from the Silent Temple. Tell Xiao Yu to be careful and to not worry about me.
DialogID_38845=<s>We must stop them. Can you go to the forest and drive away those Herb Gatherers?
DialogID_38846=<s>Now the bandits are dealt with, those Mysterious Men will be prepared. The Silent Temple have many experts and will be difficult to defeat.
DialogID_38847=<s>Please go check on Yan Qi. She took the tampered medicine and I want to know if she recovered.
DialogID_38848=<s>The doctor in the villa already visited me and I'm cured. Please thank Mr. Yan for me.
DialogID_38849=<s>Thanks to you the Woodcutters are now under control and they won't dare cause anymore trouble. But go find Zhao Erhu and ask him to supervise them just incase.
DialogID_38850=<s>Tell her to not worry. I'll watch them closely.
DialogID_38851=<s>Based on my investigation they are working for the Silent Temple. Go talk to Xiao Yu. Her father visited the White Cloud Cave before, so she might know some secrets.
DialogID_38852=<s>It's rumored that a recluse expert lived in the White Cloud Cave and had left a secret script there. But no one ever found it. Those people guarding the cave must be searching for the script too. If they are working with Silent Temple it would be bad for the Yanmen Family.
DialogID_38853=<s>That was quite a show. They won't dare make anymore trouble now. After you left a messenger came and said there are bandits near the villa. You can't rest yet. Haha.
DialogID_38854=<s>Thank you so much. Xiao Yu told me those Evil Sect Disciples fear our villa leader and are scared to make a move, but they won't give up. Ms. Murong is still collecting herbs in the mountain. Please go find her and tell her to be careful.
DialogID_38855=<s>Brother Erhu sent you? He is injured? Go back and take care of him. I'll be right behind you after I prepare the medicine.
DialogID_38857=<s>I admire your martial arts. Now the traitor is dead, Yuhuang Peak has lost control. But those experts can't be underestimated. Please go tell the villa leader.
DialogID_38858=<s>I admire your martial arts. These troublemakers from Yuhuang Peak have been plotting against Yanmen Family for a long time. We should strike them now while they are weak and take care of them once and for all. Go tell Madam Mei to make preparations.
DialogID_38859=<s>I… Ugh. I'm just back from the mountain. I run into Yanzi's father and he was injured. Those Woodcutters beat him while they were stealing his medicine. I took her father to Luoyang for treatment and now I'm on my way to tell Yanzi the news.
DialogID_38861=<s>Those guards wanted to split the stolen goods with the herb gatherers. How dare them! Good thing the housekeeper ran into their deed.
DialogID_38862=<s>You have defeated the Yuhuang Peak Warriors, but they have stronger fighters. Do you dare to take them on?
DialogID_38863=<s>Those Yuhuang Peak Evil Sect Experts were once members of the Yanmen Family. They had an disagreement with the old villa leader so they formed their own faction. The villa leader negotiated with them before and told them to not make any trouble, fearing a hidden third side would take the advantage. Go talk to Yan Buli. He knows more than me.
DialogID_38865=<s>Yuhuang Peak always was a threat to our family. The villa leader is kind and keeps tolerating them. I think it's dangerous. Go tell Murong Weiyu to be careful. I will discuss this matter with my brother.
DialogID_38866=<s>Yan Qi encountered bandits when he was out. How can the Yanmen Family allow bandits to wander outside their gates? These bandits burn down families and rob the innocents. We can't just ignore them. Can you go take care of them?
DialogID_38868=<s>These bandits are finally taken care of. Tell Qi Shuang to go visit miss Qi with me.
