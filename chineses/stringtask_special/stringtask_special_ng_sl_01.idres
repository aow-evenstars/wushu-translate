hunterinfo_80021=Passed out? Something is not right. The roadside <a href="findnpc_new,school08,npc_5nei_sl_011" style="HLStype1">captain</a> should be more alert. See if you can loosen tongue.
interactinfo_80040=A summons has come from the Shaolin. Something must have happened. Return to <a href="findnpc,school08,797,73,425" style="HLStype1">Shaolin</a> now.
interactinfo_80041=Marvelous! Whoever comes shall be treated as guest. Find a <a href="findnpc,school08,808,73,417" style="HLStype1">location</a> to wait at.
interactinfo_80042=What's that? The Southern Shaolin is challenging us? Let's see what our Abbot has to say.
interactinfo_80043=It's suspicious. Somehow <a href="findnpc,school08,803,73,408" style="HLStype1">Abbot Xuanhuai</a> was not touched. Let me inquire.
interactinfo_80044=Abbot seems calm but this is no trivial matter. I need to investigate it myself.
interactinfo_80045=The Southern Shaolin traveled a great distance to get here. I may find something checking the path they took. I'll look around the <a href="findnpc_new,school08,Event_5nei_sl_80045" style="HLStype1">village's west corridor</a>.
interactinfo_80046=There happen to be some Shaolin on guard here. I'll speak with<a href="findnpc_new,school08,npc_5nei_sl_023" style="HLStype1">Elder Brother Qingyu</a>.
interactinfo_80047=Hmph! He won't talk without some…persuasion. <a href="findnpc_new,school08,npc_5nei_sl_011" style="HLStype1">Ask</a> again.
interactinfo_80048=Check inside the <a href="findnpc_new,school08,Event_5nei_sl_80048" style="HLStype1">Shaolin Temple</a> to see if there is any trace of them.
interactinfo_80049=You think you can incapacitate me by sealing off the air with your internal energy? Hmph! Watch <a href="findnpc_new,school08,Event_5nei_sl_80049" style="HLStype1">this! </a>(They used their internal energy to seal the air. If you go to the palm of the statue of Buddha to the left, you may hear something.)
interactinfo_80050=So these people have nothing to do with the Southern Shaolin? Hmmm...something is wrong with Wu Rui. Why is he heading towards the yard alone? I better follow him <a href="findnpc_new,school08,Event_5nei_sl_80050" style="HLStype1">there</a>.
interactinfo_80051=Is this Elder Brother Qingjian? Why did Wu Rui address him as Brother Jian? Something is up!
interactinfo_80052=I don't think these bandits are capable of pulling off a theft from our Library...though they did know about the Southern Shaolin's interest in Buddha's Bone. This is getting complicated. Go speak with <a href="findnpc_new,school08,WorldNpc00212" style="HLStype1">Abbot Xuanhuai</a>. I'll save their heads for later.
interactinfo_80053=The  charges are set. Report to <a href="findnpc_new,school08,WorldNpc00212" style="HLStype1">Abbot Xuanhuai</a>.
interactinfo_80054=Abbot says it's time? I'll head to the <a href="findnpc_new,school08,Event_5nei_sl_80054" style="HLStype1">agreed upon location </a> to watch the show! (To the left of the stairs is a good spot to hide.)
interactinfo_80055=I don't think there is anyone who is can take that palm. Just who is this Shaolin Elder? <a href="findnpc_new,school08,npc_5nei_sl_020" style="HLStype1">Abbot</a> is on his way…I'll follow.
interactinfo_80061=Ask about how to get into the <a href="findnpc,clone032,606,-44,734" style="HLStype1">Qiandeng Incident</a>(Ask Chu Feng about the rules for the Qiandeng Incident)

storyinfo_80007=Just as I suspected. Return to Shaolin Temple and report to <a href="findnpc_new,school08,WorldNpc00212" style="HLStype1">Abbot Xuanhuai</a>.

useiteminfo_80005=To save his own life, the henchman's leader revealed that  bandits arrived in Shaolin and are heading to Shaoshi Mountain.

It's the <a href="findnpc_new,city02,npc_4nei_sl_yapu_1" style="HLStype1">mute servant </a>again? The way the Blade Sharpening Hall deals with things is so cold-blooded.
