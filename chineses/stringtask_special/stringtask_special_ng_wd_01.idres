I once wanted to take a peek from the back of the kitchen but I was knocked out by someone. If you want to know more you might as well wait in the back of the kitchen and look for the Mysterious Person to show up. But I'd suggest you </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >first </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >look for a Young Brother at the Disciple Room and ask for a wooden box.</font>

story_80506_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The Netherworld Powder </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >is </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >a kind of Strong Poison that was known among the barbarians of the West. The color is faint green and it has no odor. People often are not aware that they are poisoned, and the signs of being poisoned only show up after seven days. The person will feel their bones are eaten by ants and their skin has sores on it. The suffering and misery are like falling into the 18th Hell of the Netherworld, and that's how it got its name. And this kind of Strong Poison can pass from person to person through skin contact.</font>

An Elder of our School used to befriend a Barbarian of the West, who happened to know the ingredients of the Antidote to the Netherworld Powder.

It is said that the flower is cultivated with buried human bones and special fertilizer.</font>

story_80509_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I don't dare to lie to you. After I finished the morning class along with my Brothers that day, I walked alone on the mountain path near Yanxing Hall. And then suddenly I lost consciousness. I discovered that I was inside a cave when I woke up, and there was a person sitting next to me.</font>
story_80509_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >That's right, that's right! Have you seen Master Xuan Zhen before too? </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >But I didn't know that he was Master Xuan Zhen at the time. He asked me if I wanted to be his Disciple after I woke up. I remembered that I was a Wudang Disciple, so how could I betray my School? But he seemed to know what I was thinking. He told me that I don't need to worry I might betray my School, because he is from Wudang as well.</font>
story_80509_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I don't exactly know either. He told me that I only need to do some chores for him. The chore I am doing now was arranged by him. He told me he name is Xuan Zhen after I became his Disciple. I asked around among my Brothers after I came out of the cave. I didn't know I had encountered an important figure until then. I thought I was going to have a bright future. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I don't get to see him at normal times, and only see him when he makes me to send the wine every month. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What kind of Master is he? He never taught me anything useful!</font>
story_80509_5=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Strange actions? I remember one time when I went to the cave and happened to see Master Xuan Zhen drinking alone while muttering to himself. He was saying something like, "</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Brother </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Song, I caused the death and destruction of your family, that's why you couldn't die in peace...." You.... You must not tell others. The Master didn't want me to tell others about these matters.</font>
story_80510_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Song Qingyu...you are talking about that madman? I don't know where he had gone to. That guy runs down the mountain every morning after waking up.</font>
story_80510_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We were very curious in the beginning and asked him where he had rushed off to. He didn't pay us any attention, so we followed him. We saw him talking to a rock down there. The most ridiculous thing was when he stole bread from the back of the kitchen and put it in front of the rock. He was muttering about sharing the bread with the rock. Of course the rock can't eat, so he sat in front the rock and was angry at it for a long time.</font>
story_80510_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >If you want to find him, go down the mountain.</font>
