The overtone is like a heavenly music, with a sense of coolness and immortality. The sound is like a human voice, which can be used for conversation, or like the emotions of the human heart, which are indistinct and changeable. This is the music of heaven, earth and man. It can describe human feelings, and can also reach the principles of heaven, earth and the universe. </font>
