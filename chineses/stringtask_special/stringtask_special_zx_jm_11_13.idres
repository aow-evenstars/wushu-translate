
DialogID_1250=<s>The guard said you asked to see me. What for?
DialogID_1251=<s>Perhaps you don't know I'm the descent of the Ancient Tomb Sect. Since you came from that place, do me a favor. Take this Jade baldric to Yang Xie.
DialogID_1252=<s>Ziyan, why are you so cruel?
DialogID_1253=<s>Anyhow I completely lose heart. The tassels on this sword is the Love Token given to me by Ziyan. You give it back to her.
DialogID_1254=<s>I knew before that he would be very skilled and make great achievements. Please take this Letter to him and he will understand. We hope that he will give a helping hand to Dongfang Family.
DialogID_1255=Forget it. Forget it. This is the first time Ziyan has asked me for help. How could I refuse her? Ask her not to worry. I'll try my best to deal with Secret Association not for Dongfang Family, but for one person...
DialogID_1256=<s>Pick a weapon from the sword-forging room in the back.
DialogID_1257=<s>This refined steel sword is the masterpiece of Ouyang Xiang. I had no idea he gave it to you.
DialogID_1258=<s>The master asked me to see you off. This way, please.
DialogID_1259=<s>This is the Hundred Insects powder of Five-Immortal Sect in Miaojiang. Five-Immortal Sect have not been active in a long time.
DialogID_1260=<s>Gu Zhuqing is the disciple of Ximen Chuixue. You immediately go to Thousand Plum Mountain Villa in Plum Blossom Mountain and give this letter to him.
DialogID_1261=<s>Many wanderers travel to Thousand Plum Mountain Villa to see the leader, so my inn is full. I will ask the waiter to take to you a house where you can stay.
DialogID_1262=<s>You said you came here at the request of Dongfang, so you must have outstanding martial arts skills. What do you think of killing those men in black to prove your sincerity?
DialogID_1263=<s>Chuixue has been weak recently. You had better tell Wuhen the details and let him to make a decision.
DialogID_1264=<s>I've already known the murder of Qingzhu. I don't believe it was committed by Tangmen, either. I'll find out the truth and make the murderer pay for it.
DialogID_1265=<s>I heard you're Ouyang Jian. What do you think of competing with me? Don't worry. You won't hurt me if you don't mean to.
DialogID_1266=<s>Indeed it's the same as the hidden weapon that killed my father. There is rank poison on it. Qingzhu must have been killed by those Miaojiang women.
DialogID_1268=<s>This is not your fault. I heard that those Miaojiang ladies have Rank Poison in their bodies, so they do not need Antidote at all. I am afraid that Antidote is Rank Poison itself. But you will get Antidote as long as you can find their leader.
DialogID_1269=<s>The martial arts used by the Miaojiang women were Central Plains movements. There must be a man behind it. I'll look into it.
DialogID_1270=<s>Wuhen travels a lot. Go and ask him. You might find some clues.
DialogID_1271=<s>During your trip to Miaojiang this time, you might meet very dangerous situations. I have some detoxify medicine. Take with you for self-defense.
DialogID_1272=<s>Both the Silent Temple and Miaojiang have something to do with it.
DialogID_1273=<s>Nowadays Five-Immortal Sect is the biggest organization under Secret Association and is very cruel and arrogant. I know in Nianluo Dam there is a branch of Five-Immortal Sect.
DialogID_1274=<s>Don't worry. I'll guard the Villa and make whoever comes with malicious intentions a dead man.
DialogID_1275=<s>Could you tell me how to find the Five-Immortal Sect?
DialogID_1276=<s>It's stewed with supreme Qingxi Water. Drink it immediately.
DialogID_1277=Five-Immortal Sect is full of secret devices and all kinds of poisonous worms and strange beasts. I'm afraid you'll die before you get there.
DialogID_1278=This...I have a dose of medicine here. Take it. It should be able to contain the toxicity.
DialogID_1279=<s>What? You got snake poison? ! Let me see.
DialogID_1280=<s>Five-Immortal Sect is full of miasma. You need to take a piece of penthorum Chinense pursh with you, but this plant grows in a place full of rebellious villains.
DialogID_1281=Could you please get rid of the thugs outside the stronghold?
DialogID_1282=<s>I have a letter here. You send it to A Nisang of Five-Immortal Sect. She will eliminate the poison for you.
DialogID_1283=Oh? Then you take this small snake with you and find Little Sister Song.
DialogID_1284=(Little Sister Song took out a poisonous centipede, and fed it with snake gall) Take this centipede to find Jin Zhuni.
DialogID_1285=<s>(Jin Zhuni took out the poisonous scorpion unwillingly and fed the scorpion with centipede)
DialogID_1286=<s>(Dong Nacai fed the spider with scorpion) Take this Spider to see A Nisang.
DialogID_1287=Tell him his daughter is dead. Take this toad to him. It should be able to eliminate your poison.
DialogID_1288=<s>This antidote got rid of most of the toxicity, but if you want to eliminate all the poison, you have to ask the Hierach of Five-Immortal Sect for the last antidote.
DialogID_1289=<s>I had no idea you could defeat Corpse and Poison Twin Envoys. This is the token. Here you are.
DialogID_1290=We swore never to go near the Central Plains. It cannot be our disciples.
DialogID_1291=I don't know. But I have already sent some disciples to investigate it. This group of people have acted strangely and must aim at something.
DialogID_1292=Secret Association? I don't think it's so simple. You go to Snake Cave and have a check once again.
DialogID_1293=It is Hundred Insects powder, but it looks a bit different.
DialogID_1294=Can you take this letter to my father?
DialogID_1295=Why don't you make it easier for yourself?
DialogID_1296=<s>I'm the head of Secret Association Poison Maker. Ha. Ha. But unfortunately you cannot make me stay.
DialogID_1297=Five-Immortal sect has very strict rules. A Nisang is to incriminate me...
DialogID_1298=<s>Secret Association? What on earth are they going to do? I will track them down and find out the truth.
DialogID_1299=<s>I'll ask the poison expert of Tangmen to test whether this poison is the same as that poisoned Gu Qingzhu.
DialogID_1300=<s>Secret Association Poison Maker? Ha. Ha. I know a little, but if you want to know the details, go and find Omniscient Scholar.
DialogID_1301=<s>Eventually, they suffered.
DialogID_1302=I'll give you you the musical score if you can get rid of the bandit in the city.
DialogID_1303=I've never broken my promise. This is "Guangling Poem" Musical Score.
DialogID_1304=<s>Huzhou pens? I happen to have some spare ones. You seem very sincere. I'll give you one.
DialogID_1305=<s>Well. The painting in your hand is not bad. Would you please let me have a look?
DialogID_1306=<s>I had no idea you have such great skills.
DialogID_1307=<s>I cannot tell you anything just because of this letter. It's not easy for me to get the news, either.
DialogID_1308=<s>I happen to have a White Jade which can avoid all Poisons. Take it for self-defense.
DialogID_1309=<s>Do you remember the criminal we caught in Taiping Village?
DialogID_1310=<s>You should become my disciple. Then, Feng Zhengheng wouldn't dare bother you.
DialogID_1311=<s>You walk forward and can get out of here once you defeat those Head Helm Third Hall Experts.
DialogID_1312=Please don't kill me! Here is the real antidote!
DialogID_1313=<s>Sword God Ximen Chuixue? Ok. What do you want to know?
DialogID_1314=<s>I do not know when they will come again.
DialogID_1315=<s>She still misses her countrymen. This box of crispy sugar has been A Nisang's favorite sweet food of Central Plains since she was a little girl.
DialogID_1316=<s>Crispy sugar? ! (Sobbing) Those merchants from Central Plains have always been mercenary. Father must have bought it at a very high price.
DialogID_1317=<s>Thank you for your help. The hierarch now wishes to take down the Three-god Priests and finally restore order to the sect.
DialogID_1318=<s>Nice. That is also what I mean. Anyway, they are related to the thing you are investigating.
DialogID_1319=<s>But my rule is to gamble not to sell. How about taking a gamble? You will have to do a thing for me if you lose.
QiecuoMenu_1250=Please feel free to give me some advice.
QiecuoMenu_1255=In that case, excuse me.
QiecuoMenu_1256=Give me the antidote. I won't take your life.
QiecuoMenu_1258=That's so good.
QiecuoMenu_1261=It's over.
QiecuoMenu_1262=It's over.
QiecuoMenu_1263=It's over.
QiecuoMenu_1264=Girl, you listen to me...
QiecuoMenu_1265=Then excuse me.
QiecuoMenu_1266=I would like to know who you are.
QiecuoMenu_1268=Just show me whatever you can.
QiecuoMenu_1271=Why are you running?
QiecuoMenu_1272=Girl, you're mistaken. I come here only to send a letter to Omniscient Scholar.
QiecuoMenu_1273=OK.
QiecuoMenu_1274=offended.
QiecuoMenu_1275=Why don't you leave me alone?
QiecuoMenu_1276=It's over.
QiecuoMenu_1280=It's over.
QiecuoMenu_1281=Boast shamelessly.
QiecuoTitle_1250=<s>Show me whatever you can. Don't worry about hurting me.
QiecuoTitle_1255=<s>You first.
QiecuoTitle_1256=<s>No more talking. I'm ready to fight.
QiecuoTitle_1258=<s>I need to test your martial arts skills but don't worry, I won't use all of my skills.
QiecuoTitle_1261=You're a spy if you don't have a token. Take this movement first.
QiecuoTitle_1262=<s>You'll first have to pass this round.
QiecuoTitle_1263=Why do you have the right to see the hierarch?
QiecuoTitle_1264=Hmph. Glib tongue. Elder Martial Sister, you're right. There is no good man in the world. Take the move.
QiecuoTitle_1265=The Hierarch is right in the Sect, but, you have to pass me first.
QiecuoTitle_1266=Who are you? Get away. Or you're a dead man.
QiecuoTitle_1268=<s>Let me acompany you for some more time.
QiecuoTitle_1271=<s>You want to get back the painting? Defeat me first.
QiecuoTitle_1272=<s>One Flower Huang Jiaojiao is to appreciate your expert skills.
QiecuoTitle_1273=<s>No matter what you come here for, pass our rounds first.
QiecuoTitle_1274=You seem to have some skills. In that case, I will spare no effort.
QiecuoTitle_1275=Hey. Let me send you to hell.
QiecuoTitle_1276=I might look young, but I'm 100 years old.
QiecuoTitle_1280=<s>No more nonsense. I'll take your life.
QiecuoTitle_1281=<s>Don't worry. I won't take your life.
