DialogID_56841=<s>What would you like today?
DialogID_56842=Here you are. Enjoy and take care.
DialogID_56843=<s>That's right! Back when Emperor Taizu was fighting for power he had an oath brother working for him. They took the oath to be brothers when they were young and started the rebellion together. They protected each other and fought side by side. It's because of this team effort that they gained control over this vast land.
DialogID_56844=<s>At the beginning of the new dynasty Emperor Taizu made his oath brother a lord and named him the Kingdom Protector. He also promised that their descendants will take turn being the emperor. But who could've guessed Emperor Hui took the throne after Taizu passed. The court was against this but Lord Chong didn't budge and defended the new emperor's authority. Then after Lord Chong passed away, no one dared to mention what happened again.
DialogID_56845=<s>How dare you judge the emperor? Although even the emperor admired him... The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Lord Chong's son is named Chong Yao. He was talented in both literacy and martial arts since birth, and was blessed with a strong body. He inherited his father's title when he was young, and afterwards he went to war seven times at the northern border. He was victorious every time and became the protector of the country.
DialogID_56846=<s>Oh, how glorious was the Ever-Victorious Lord Chong! But he was still not satisfied and wanted to fight for the throne, all because of something said as a joke in the past. As a result of his ambition, he planned to assassinate the emperor a few month ago when he was invited to the imperial palace.
DialogID_56847=<s>Do you recognize him? Then do you know why only four of the five silly judges are here today? Dead!!! Our third brother is dead!!!
DialogID_56848=<s>It's not your fault… Chong Yao planned this for years. He know our defenses and took his time to train those killers. How could we compete with them?
DialogID_56849=<s>Indeed. We were so scared after seeing so many incoming experts. But then someone powerful wearing a eunuch uniform came to the rescue and single-handedly battled the two hundred trained killers at the entrance with golden needles. We then found the time to call for backup.
DialogID_56850=<s>We were shocked by his techniques. He was so fast it was all a blur.
DialogID_56851=<s>The wine is pretty good for a place like this. According to the law a traitor like Chong Yao should have his whole family executed. But the emperor is benevolent since his family is the descendants of a great patriot, and didn't kill him or his family. He was only casted out.
DialogID_56852=<s>Do you think the emperor is easy-going? Do you see that coffin on top of Chong Yao?
DialogID_56853=<s>The death penalty was pardoned but there are other punishments. The emperor made a coffin with one thousand pounds of iron just to store the ashes of those two hundred dead killers, and to deny them of their afterlife.
DialogID_56854=<s>There are people in this world who don't believe in destiny and want to change their fate. Do you think they deserve to die?
DialogID_56855=<s>What if they went against the emperor? And want to challenge the throne?
DialogID_56856=<s>Are you a traitor?
DialogID_56857=<s>Who is that person yelling in the front?
DialogID_56858=<s>Who are you?
DialogID_56859=<s>So he finally made up his mind. I have a plan. With the Shi Chi Fei Mo Five Brothers working together it's impossible to get near them unless we outnumber them greatly, Even with their formation broken their array are still powerful. But their days working as guards must be tiring. Go ask Grandma Tang for some Tangmen Secret Medicine then go purchase some wine to fix them in. Their silver needles won't detect the drugs, so they will fall into our trap!
DialogID_56860=<s>Where did Li Xiang find this little rascal… Why do we need to worry about this?
DialogID_56861=<s>Why would Xiao Yezi want this poison… Here, take it. Only this Sedative won't be detected by Silver Needles.
DialogID_56862=<s>Who are you? Why so generous… (Tests the wine with a Silver Needle)
DialogID_56863=<s>Mmm, this wine is not bad… Have a taste, brothers… Tell me, what do you need?... Mmm, this wine has a strong kick!
DialogID_56864=<s>You are smart. We will pay a visit to you soon.
DialogID_56865=
DialogID_56866=
DialogID_56867=
DialogID_56868=<s>Don't! Don't break it! If you do I will kill myself.
DialogID_56869=<s>He suffered a great defeat last time he rebelled against the emperor. I fear he lost his guts to try again.
DialogID_56870=<s>Dong Tianming was born to a prestigious family, and was gifted and successful growing up. Afterwards he then joined the army and won every fight. His confidence and arrogance built up to a point that he dared to challenge the throne. He suffered a great defeat and was traumatized after witnessing the death of his followers. During that time he lost his hope of staying alive and wasn't afraid of anything. But after the emperor spared him and thought of this strange way to torture him, all that trauma finally caught up with him.
DialogID_56871=<s>Now it's clear how important that defeat was to his life. Dong Tianming couldn't face the truth after waking up because of how painful it is. The ashes of two hundred men cries to him day and night from the coffin behind him. From that day on his head is filled with regret and pain everyday, and slowly it changed his memory of that massacre.
DialogID_56872=<s>It was a history-changing battle conquered by fate. It was hard-fought, romantic, legendary, adventurous, and might even be considered perfect. If fate didn't send that Eunuch, he would had became the ruler of the land already!
DialogID_56873=<s>But now after we rescued him and gave him his freedom back, his fears finally caught up with him. He is scared of trying again because he don't want to lose again. If history repeats itself, it won't be pretty.
DialogID_56874=<s>(Talking to Dong Tianming) You are just a kid who tripped on a watermelon peel. You only wanted to boast how gracefully you have fallen in front of the bystanders, but are afraid to stand up and walk again. You don't want anyone finding out there might be something wrong with your legs.
DialogID_56875=<s>.........
DialogID_56876=<s>You should come with us.
DialogID_56877=<s>One must endure to be successful in life.
DialogID_56878=<s>Hahaha. Let me ask you. What are the commoners like?
DialogID_56879=<s>Water? Haha. Don't believe everything philosophers say. If they are so smart then why all of them are so poor? It's wrong! These commoners are more like the chickens ready to be slaughtered. All those philosophies about commoners are like water, they can float the ship or drown it, are all lies.
DialogID_56880=<s>Behind.
QiecuoMenu_56840=Do you want to die? Don't bring me down with you!
QiecuoMenu_56843=Ha.
QiecuoMenu_56844=Cheers.
QiecuoMenu_56845=Yeah.
QiecuoTitle_56840=<s>We are a small business and can't afford all these damages.
QiecuoTitle_56843=<s>I'm so hungry… So hungry…
QiecuoTitle_56844=<s>Congee… Congee…
QiecuoTitle_56845=<s>I want congee… Congee…
