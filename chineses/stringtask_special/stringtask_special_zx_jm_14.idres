DialogID_1326=<s>Who is it? You cannot enter without the permission token!
DialogID_1327=<s>I basically don't give in to outsiders. This time it's for the sake of Bai Xiaosheng, but I will not promise you so easily. Go exterminate some Yading village bandits, and also help me to pick some green bamboo.
DialogID_1328=Excuse me, as you are an outsider, all outsiders wanting to enter the teahouse must first obtain a permit from the king. You better go find the king to obtain the permit.
DialogID_1329=What natural ability!
DialogID_1330=<s>Have mercy great hero, I don't dare anymore. I am a Secret Association disciple sent by our head to conduct reconnaissance. Our head is still inside the teahouse.
DialogID_1331=<s>Great hero, have… have mercy! I am following the orders of the leader in pursuing you. It is difficult for me, and it was not my intention to do this.
DialogID_1332=<s>DialogID_1332
DialogID_1333=<s>You even look elegant in this outfit, really more good-looking than the ladies of Nation of Girls.
DialogID_1334=<s>Yo, pretty little lady, want to let me spoil you? Hahaha!
DialogID_1335=<s>DialogID_1335
DialogID_1336=<s>I see you are asking others if they have seen you fighting the evildoers just now. I can guarantee it for you, I saw it.
DialogID_1339=<s>I didn't do anything. Da Cheng has indeed been captured. They brought him into the nearby gully.
DialogID_1340=<s> Thanks for saving my life, {@IDName:Player}.
DialogID_1341=You have done another good deed. Quickly go tell the general that the assassin has been captured!
QiecuoMenu_1326=I have yet to flee from a hundred battles, come on!
QiecuoMenu_1327=I am looking for you. How dare you make trouble here?
QiecuoMenu_1328=Less idle talk, wait to be captured!
QiecuoMenu_1329=Hahahaha, you dare to show your little tricks in front of the great master?
QiecuoMenu_1330=So it was you who sabotaged me to no end, I must teach you a lesson!
QiecuoMenu_1331=No offense.
QiecuoTitle_1326=<s>You must be careful!
QiecuoTitle_1327=<s>Everyone flees when they see me, but you don't. Are you looking for your own death?
QiecuoTitle_1328=<s>Hmph, you managed to find me.
QiecuoTitle_1329=<s>You are actually in disguise! I want your life!
QiecuoTitle_1330=<s>Why do you always spoil my plans? Last time I impersonated you and killed the queen, why are you not dead yet?
QiecuoTitle_1331=<s>Don't be afraid of hurting me, come on.

okmenu_1326=Looks like we better go find Bai Xiaosheng to think of solutions.
okmenu_1327=There is no problem if you keep your promises.
okmenu_1328=Ok, I shall go greet the King.
okmenu_1329=Thank you! Is there anything bothering you?
okmenu_1330=If you are telling lies, I will not have mercy on you. I must bring such an important matter to the attention of the general.
okmenu_1331=What's the use of saying all this now? You better speak with the Nation of Girls queen.
okmenu_1333=Please don't make fun of me. I have to go now.
okmenu_1334=Hmph, open your eyes to see clearly. But now, it is too late for you to have regrets.
okmenu_1336=That is too good to be true, I finally have evidence to prove my innocence.
okmenu_1339=Not bad, you are honest.
okmenu_1340=No need to be polite. Your wife has been waiting a long time for you, let me escort you back.
okmenu_1341=Ok.
story_1325_1=(Sigh), a few days ago there was a highly-skilled evildoer causing chaos on the street. The general of my sect has tried to capture him many times but failed?
story_1325_2=Ask the female general for the details, she knows more clearly than I do.
story_1326_1=<s>After you left, a highly-skilled assassin came to assassinate the queen. Fortunately, I managed to save her on time.
story_1326_2=<s>I unveiled that person whilst he was in the midst of escaping, and he had your face! Tell me who you are.
story_1327_1=<s>You have spoiled our plans many times. The head cultist wants to kill you so as to make our lives easier.
story_1327_2=<s>The head cultist said you have extraordinary skills and are difficult to deal with. So he told us to be insidious and borrow your knife to kill others,
story_1328_2=<s>The way of Taiji lies in the birth of two notions, which give rise to four faces, which give rise to the eight trigrams, which give rise to what has no boundaries. From calmness to control movement, using softness to conquer hardness. Every move is boundless and limitless change. When you practice your martial arts, you need to be thinking and considering diligently, so as to come up with your own moveset.
story_menu_1325=If it is within my means, I will definitely do it for you.
story_menu_1326=<s>What really happened? Please tell me clearly, general. If you suspect me, I will not escape also.
story_menu_1327=<s>What motive do you have?
story_menu_1328=If you give me half a tip, I will definitely use it endlessly!

storymenu_1325_2=Alright, Your Highness.
storymenu_1326_1=So why did you say it was me who assassinated the queen?
storymenu_1326_2=I want to see the queen now, to explain everything clearly.
storymenu_1327_1=So he sent you to pursue me to Nation of Girls? Then why not kill me directly but instead impersonate me to assassinate the queen?
storymenu_1327_2=Hehe, so you are this devious.
storymenu_1328_1=I have heard of Taiji's vastness and profoundness.
