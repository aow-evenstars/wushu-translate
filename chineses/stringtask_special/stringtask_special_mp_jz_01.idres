storymenu_7009_1=I will keep that in mind.
storymenu_7009_2=As it happens, I know someone who draws beautiful plum blossoms in the Scholars Sect.
useiteminfo_7000=Notify the Tripod Clan about Xias' death using Headmaster's <a href="TASK_ITEM,useitem_1w" style="HLStype1">Carrier Pigeon</a>
useiteminfo_7001=Smash the <a href="TASK_ITEM,useitem_2w" style="HLStype1">unprocessed herbs</a>.
useiteminfo_7002_2=Use the <a href="TASK_ITEM,useitem_3w" style="HLStype1"> Golden Needle to heal </a> <a href="findnpc_new,school03,WorldNpc03335" style="HLStype1"> Dong Yunbo</a>.
okmenu_7259=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >With this gift, Dong Yunbo swears to offer help to you, always.</font>
story_7252_1=That's right. Back then when Xu Da obtained Wumu Script he gave it to Zhu Di. Later he had a disagreement with Zhu Yunwen and started a rebellion. I then obtained the Wumu Script during that state of turmoil when I was working for Lord Yan. I live here in seclusion because I do not want this script to fall into the wrong hands.
DialogID_7062=We have to find a way to kill him anyway to get revenge for my brothers and remove a pest for the court!
DialogID_7219=The killer? Haha! It is true that I killed a lot of people, but I never deny it.
DialogID_7221=You came just in time. I was attacked last night and was badly injured... There is no doctor in this village. I have to ask you to go to Emei to get some medicine to heal my wounds. In addition, the ones who attacked me were probably the disciples of Emei. Maybe it was by someone's order. It's very strange. Please go and check it out.
DialogID_7225=Spare my life. I'm just an agent of Royal Guards. The mastermind of the attack is now in Emei. Her name is Tang Chan, now under the alias of You Junchan.
DialogID_7228=I was originally a disciple of Tangmen. Because of my love to a senior brother, I poisoned his enemy, but unexpectedly it became known. He even led people to kill me. I was forced to flee Tangmen to join the Royal Guards. Now I am placed in Emei as a spy to provoke the relationship between the factions. Now that the plan has failed and I am useless to Royal Guards, I have taken the poison. No need to kill me. When you see Tang Hanyu, please tell him that I never regret doing anything for him...
DialogID_7258=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What is the problem? Xia Wuyou is Wanderer Valley's target, not me.</font>
DialogID_7264=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff"> I just heard that they've sent a group of assassins to kill me. Be careful, Young Hero. </font>
QiecuoMenu_7007=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Do you think you can get away after what you've done?</font>
QiecuoMenu_7045=Do you want to tie up the loose ends?
choosemenu_22_2_1=I think Wanderer's Valley is targeting Xia Wuyou first.
collectinfo_7013=Kill <a href="findnpc_new,scene02,monf020600" style="HLStype1">Penglai Disciple</a> and see what comes out of it
convoyinfo_7001=The assassins are here. Protect Xia Wuyou.
convoyinfo_7033=Defeat Sima Ruoguang with soldiers
hunterinfo_7006=Defeat the <a href="findnpc_new,school03,monrm031100" style="HLStype1">Wanderer's Valley Spies</a>
hunterinfo_7223=Defeat <a href="findnpc_new,school05,monrm050003" style="HLStype1">Killers in Black</a>
hunterinfo_7227=Kill <a href="findnpc_new,school05,monrm050003" style="HLStype1">Killers in Black</a>
interactinfo_7258=Protect <a href="findnpc_new,school03,WorldNpc03335" style="HLStype1">Dong Yunbo</a>.
okmenu_7258=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Someone is manipulating Thunderbolt Hall...and they will almost certainly kill to conceal their involvement. </font>
story_7003_2=<s>The rumor says that Wanderer's Valley absorbed Thunderbolt Hall and has been trying to get the Tripod in too, but they keep resisting. I think Wanderer's Valley is taking this opportunity to eradicate the Tripod Clan.
story_7022_2=Those Blissful Forest Killers didn't actually come to kill me. I felt that the matter was exposed, and I didn't want to be implicated in Jianghu because of this. They came to kill Tang Jiu. He got to live because he wasn't there.
story_7039_2=Shi Yanbing is kind by nature. I think he certainly will not strike first. It's just been so many years, so he might have changed.
story_7211_1=I visited Miss Tang after you left. Unexpectedly I encountered someone attacking Miss Tang. I chased those assassins and lured them away. Fortunately, you came in time. Hurry up and protect Miss Tang. I will be just fine.
story_7221_1=A Western Lama. I had already planned to spread the rumor that Riverside Scene At Qingming Festival was acquired by Nishang Palace, but I got carried away and wanted to get some money for it. I did not know that many in Jianghu were after it. I'm dying. This incident is a secret plan set up by Bai Suyu, the white haired hag, to eliminate Mei Yingxue, the master of Nishang Palace. I am not acting on my will either!
story_7227_1=Hmph! How would I be alive till today if I didn't pretend to be deaf and dumb? My uncle secretly learned other martial arts and dealt with troubles later. If I hadn't found out earlier, how could I have escaped his clutches by pretending to be crazy and foolish?
story_7231_1=I don't want revenge. But Liu Fang still doesn't give up. There must be a reason for not leaving here... Over the years, my uncle has taught us a lot of martial arts from other sects, but I still don't know what is on his mind.
story_7232_1=I will find a way to get revenge on this matter. My revenge is not just for myself. It is for my teacher's daughter... My younger martial sister Zhou Leer...
story_7235_1=Although I did not see the master killed with my own eyes like the younger sister, but I know the master too well. My master practiced martial arts only for health. His greatest passion in life is to play the lute, but this decade I have never heard him play a song. Afterwards disciples were attacked. That beast lured disciples from schools which martial arts he hasn't yet learned. After acquiring the disciple's martial arts, he killed them.
storymenu_7005_2=We have little evidence, but from the assassin's move, he must was sent by Wanderer's Valley.
storymenu_7032_1=What is the relationship between the attack on the Beggar's Sect Disciples and Yanbing?
storymenu_7033_1=Yanbing usually treats us so well. Why would he randomly attack anyone?
storymenu_7039_1=But Yanbing has not been out of the Scholars for more than a month, how can he be behind the attack?
