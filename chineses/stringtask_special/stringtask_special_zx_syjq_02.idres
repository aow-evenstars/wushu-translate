DialogID_73827=
DialogID_73828=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >(Clasping fists and bowing) Greetings, master Xiao and master Shi. I'm sure you two have heard about the Yanyu Villa thing. The Shaolin Temple Abbot, fearing that the wrong-minded people will seize the Wuding Records and harm the world, held a meeting in Shaolin and called on the four righteous factions to join hands to find the secret scripture. Since it involved the secret teachings of the schools, the four factions agreed that if they succeeded in getting the secret book, they would burn it on the spot in the presence of all the people. </font>
DialogID_73829=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >(Sighs) Alas, at the moment, the martial arts tyrants are rampaging, and whenever they meet someone who is rushing to one place, they will definitely draw their swords and face each other. Just because one less person competing for Wuding Records, a bit more of a chance for them. Those with slightly inferior martial arts skills either died on the road or sensed danger and turned halfway back. Now the hundreds of people gathered at the Yanyu Villa are all experts in the world. I'm afraid there will be a fierce fight. </font>
DialogID_73830=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Not long ago, a shocking news suddenly spread in the Wulin. It is said that after the emperor ascended the throne, in order to control the increasingly prosperous Jianghu forces, he ordered the Royal Guards to hide in the Jianghu and collect Wuding Records compiled by the world's martial arts, but due to the misconduct of the commander, the scriptures accidentally got into Yanyu Villa. And all the forces rushed there all at once. It is said that there are at least a hundred horses running to death on this Jiangnan road every day. </font>
DialogID_73831=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Even people who were indifferent to fame and fortune, who had no intention of doing so, had to be invited by fellow disciples or fellow friends to help in the fight, and were involved in this calamity. So this time, even Shaolin, Wudang, Emei and Beggar's Sect and other well-known sects have made a move...</font>
DialogID_73832=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The court is very afraid of the power of the Jianghu. Six years ago, the Foreign Wulin and the Central Plains Experts had a fierce battle which was tragic... No wonder Leader suspected that the hidden treasure was a sheer fiction, but insisted on going to prevent this tragedy. </font>
DialogID_73834=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > (Glanced at you, said to Elder Shi) Could it be that your guild leader Xiao Tianfang also went to the Yanyu Villa? </font>

DialogID_73860=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >(Smiling brightly) Thank you, Mr. Xiao, for thinking for me. However, since I came here to find someone, I naturally wanted to let that person know who was looking for them. Even if it was a little risky to do so, it was worth it. </font>

okmenu_73825=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >My family has few people and there are no relatives by my side. The lights and candles are too bright and the flute and drums are too noisy. It is better to go boating on Tai Lake. The breeze and bright moon are priceless. </font>
okmenu_73828=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >(Shi Yanbing and I looked at each other and were both touched) The benevolent spirit of the four righteous schools is admirable. </font>
okmenu_73829=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >(Frowning slightly, pondered for a moment and said) Do you know who was the person who first spread the news about Wuding Records? </font>
okmenu_73830=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >How could one person alone have won Wuding Records from such a complicated situation? Those Wulin elite may not understand this, so they gathered together in private and form an alliance. This will give the insidious and cunning people the advantage of opportunity to sow discord and plot mischief. </font>

okmenu_73847=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Let's go. </font>
okmenu_73850=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >(Putting down the sword score in hand, laughing) When it comes to the excitement, even the wise one can't sit still. </font>

storymenu_73807_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >(Laughing and shaking head) Our dynasty attaches importance to official school, only to call on the world's students to study Confucian scriptures, the eight system of art. And for what? Only to confine the mind, exclude dissidents! </font>

story_73801_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Tianwaitian is located on an island east of Yanyu Villa. It's the most influential assassin organization in Wulin. Its killers are known for their secrecy and skills. Many people have heard of them but no one knows much about them.</font>
