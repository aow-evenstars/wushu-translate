story_32611_1=<s>It is useless. This is unique miraculous medicine of Xingxiu Sect. There is no antidote. You go to find Xue Muren for me. Only he can save me.
story_32619_2=<s>Same as hidden weapons, the use of poison is despised by the righteous sects in Jianghu. But many people still use it in hopes of gaining an upper hand. The people of Xingxiu Sect are such people, and are feared in Jianghu.
story_32622_1=The Xingxiu Sect have been committing crimes in Jianghu recently and killed a lot of people. Many sects are here for revenge. There are Wudang and Tangmen. Those disciples of Tangmen are the most troublesome.
story_32622_2=<s>Both Xingxiu Sect and Tangmen are poison users. I don't know how they done it, but that day they poisoned all the wine in the inn and injured a lot of customers. In the end all the wine had to be thrown away. Ugh.
story_32625_1=Today I will talk about the rare Dog Beating Staff Technique. The Dog Beating Staff Technique has thirty six different moves and was created by the founder of Beggar's Sect. It was passed from leader to leader each generation and never taught to outsiders. This technique has a vulgar name, but it's moves are sophisticated and profound.
story_32625_2=Let me continue. The Dog Beating Staff Technique chases the enemy and borrows strength from the enemy. No matter what weapon the enemy wields, the bamboo stick entangles it like a vine entangles a tree. When the technique is used to stab at enemy's acupoints or other weak spots, it is inescapable. The technique is also cunning and is known to overcome greater strength with the lesser. Years ago when beggar disciples rebelled, the sect leader bested the four elders with the Dog Beating Staff Technique to reassert his dominance.

story_32604_3=<s>A very greedy Wudang disciple, he was disliked by the others. In anger, he killed some fellow disciples and escaped punishment in Evil Men's Valley.
story_32609_4=Later the brothers did separate. Before parting, Guan Ning once again repeated his reasoning to Hua Xin, but he would not listen. As a result, Hua Xin was killed because he played up to the powerful. Though Guan Ning was exiled to Liaodong, he later taught the local people the ways of benevolence and morality. He was loved and supported by the people and made himself good reputation. That is the story of broken friendship. That is, the ancients saw the choice of friends as a serious matter. An important one.
