story_35003_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Liu Jian from the Town told me that!</font>
story_35003_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Don't you know? He was Old Man Xu's neighbor and grew up with Yingzhi. But his parents died when he was young and he was too poor to come up with the betrothal gifts. For that reason, Old Man Xu wouldn't allow him to marry his daughter. He then asked me to stir things up. I thought it was a </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >good thing </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >to do. I agreed to do it because Old Man Xu was only thinking about money, and was determined to marry his daughter to Councilor Chen in town. What I tell you is true, or you go and ask Liu Jian.</font>
story_35004_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ah, this Brother. It's me. What can I do for you?</font>
story_35004_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ah-Hah! I knew someone would find out. Young Hero, I was forced to do it. I grew up with Yingzhi and we are in love with each other. I swore that I would marry no one except her. But my parents both died and I am dirt poor and couldn't come up with the betrothal gifts demanded by Old Man Xu. Yingzhi and I are both healthy and will work hard to make money, but Old Man Xu wouldn't allow us to marry. Sniff-sniff.</font>
story_35005_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I know about this. Mr. Liu and I love each other, but my father was determined to marry me to that Councilor Chen. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We are running out of ideas.</font>
story_35005_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Young Hero, you think too much. Brother Jian and I have already pledged to marry each other, and I won't marry </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >another </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >as long as I live. Young Hero, please help us!</font>
story_35006_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What? Yingzhi is gone? Why did she leave?</font>
story_35006_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ha! Why did she leave? I worked hard to raise her, and now </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >she </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >left her home for that poor guy?</font>
story_35006_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ah-Hah! I had her interests in my heart. Young Hero, I used to be young and loved someone too. What parent doesn't </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >want </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >his child to have an easy life? I watched Liu Jian growing up. He is honest and does his duties. I believe that he will treat my daughter well. Young Hero, please bring them back. I don't have many talents, but I know how to make wine. I'm willing to teach my wine-making skill to Liu Jian. I only want my daughter to stay.</font>
story_35007_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thank you, Young Hero. Actually, I knew my dad would have that kind of reaction.</font>
story_35007_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >My father and I have depended on each other since I was young. Of course I'm not willing to leave him. My father talks tough but he has a soft heart. He wouldn't have given in if I didn't do this. Liu and I came up with this idea. I already dug out the Daughter's Wine buried by my dad. Actually Daughter's Wine is but a name. We don't need to follow that old custom. Who says we can only drink it only when a daughter is married?</font>
story_35008_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Young Hero, you might not know. I made some money with my wine-making skill in the early years and now I have enough to live on for life. My wife died young and left me only a daughter. I buried a lot of Daughter's Wine when she was born. It is to be opened when </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >she </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >marries. But now someone is eyeing my Daughter's Wine and wants to buy it no matter what.</font>
story_35008_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >They are those drunks led by Wang Fugui in town. They work on the Wharf and are very strong. I'm but an old man living with my unmarried daughter. We won't be able to fight them off. I sold him some in the beginning, but he still won't give up, </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >and insists on buying the rest. But I'm going to use it when my daughter marries. I can't sell more. Young Hero, please talk to those guys for me. They are often around the seaside.</font>

story_menu_35007=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Mistress, Brother Liu, it's a good thing that you haven't gone far. Don't go. You dad has forgiven you, and said that he would pass the skill to Brother Liu.</font>
