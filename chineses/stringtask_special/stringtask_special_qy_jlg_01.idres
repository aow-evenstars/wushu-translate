okmenu_52000=What happened?
okmenu_52001=Don't worry, girl Cao Qin! I will tell the truth.
okmenu_52002=Predecessor, I have found the Herb Juice of Millennium Mount Tianshan Snow Lotus back.
okmenu_52003=Valley Leader has the order that invite Buddha Envoy to go to ferry at the foot of mountain to meet.
okmenu_52004=Madam, you are so poised and graceful. Your fragrance lingers at Sir Anle's place. May I ask if the left hairpin belongs to you?
okmenu_52005=Brother Bai, I come to express thanks for Sun Shiyun.
story_52000_1=I have a treasure map. Are you interested?
story_52000_2=Calm down - don't take out your blade. Let me explain.
story_52000_3=Xiao Ke rescued a barbarian merchant at his last gasp. On his death bed, he gave me a box and told me not to open it, but to bury it. I did, but marked the ground so I could dig it up if needed. As expected, it's been stolen.
story_52000_4=To tell you the truth, I have dispatched several batches of people. But no one can survive and take the box back.
story_52000_5=That's impossible. The key of the box is still here. It's an artful box, so even the skillful craftsman in the world may not be able to open it without the key. Opening by force will destroy the stuffing inside.
story_52001_1=Is there something I can do for you?
story_52001_2=What are you talking about? This man is fat and messy.
story_52002_1=Is he a friend of yours?
story_52002_2=Well, we are just men and we don't speak in riddles. What's wrong with stealing from the rich to assist the poor?
story_52003_1=My Shifu tells me this place, as well as the people in it, is very dangerous.
story_52003_2=When he saw me, he was so surprised that his eyeballs nearly fell out. How can I blame him?
story_52004_1=How are things going with you? Did you learn anything from him?
story_52005_1=How could the master actually suspect I did something wrong.
story_52005_2=You mean that day? The day, the day that I was...
story_52005_3=Yeah, yeah, yeah. You also know that we were grinding herbs late into the night...
story_52005_4=I stole the Blissful Flower, then I went to Chang Qin, not returning until the following morning.
story_52005_5=Wei Gong said that the Blissful Flower could maintain beauty and youth, so I stole some of its liquid.
story_52006_1=Yes. What a pity. I wonder if Shifu can make this Pill. There are so many kinds of herbs which are quite rare. It should be hard to collect them.
story_52006_2=Millennium Mount Tianshan Snow Lotus? I remembered that Shifu gave us the Millennium Lotus at that evening. Then Gao Chao and I mashed it and mixed it in the medicine. After storing it, we put it into the Pharmacy for the Precious Herbs which Shifu set up specially. That Pharmacy has two locks. Gao Chao has one key, and I have the other one. When get the medicine, both of us should come and open the lock together. Oh, Gao Chao was late when we came to get the medicine in the next day. Shifu was there, too. How can it be lack of the Millennium Lotus?
story_52006_3=Ah! Blissful Flower? How do you know that? It must be Gao Chao that he told you everything. Don't tell anybody please. I plan to send it to Xiaohong in Dounan Yard.
story_52007_1=Thank you very much.
story_52007_2=Wei Gong? Who is he?
story_52007_3=I don't know and have never seen before.
story_52008_1=Right, it's in my hand. I still haven't used it yet.
story_52009_1=Did that guy say anything to insult me?
story_52009_2=Mist Fox has some nerve threatening me! Whatever happened to him, he deserved it.
story_52010_1=Are you going to kill me?
story_52010_2=Shan Tianming killed my family and pretended to rescue me in order to be with me. I stole the secret of Delightful Valley to teach him a lesson and then threw the jade away.
story_52010_3=... No! I'm sobbing... You have flirted me for such a long time and got all the secrets from me. Bu now you just want to leave without saying anything? Sobbing...
story_52010_4=I can tell by your eyes you have a desire for justice. I have no use for it, so you can have his jade. Keep it hidden, though.
story_52011_1=Sir Anle hurt himself while practising. He needs to spend several days resting.
story_52011_2=Where is the man?
story_52011_3=(Disappointed) Those are prisoners who escaped from Wandering Soul Cave decades ago. They are flagitious so as to steal the holy treasure of our Cult. You needn't to know too much. Tianjing was very glad to hear that you were back. She asked me to make sure that you went to meet her. I have to trouble you to take care of my sister.
story_52012_1=Deputy Valley Leader, there's no one else here. You just call me like this?
story_52012_2=Brother, since you've been with that woman, you are getting more confused. Why do the two old men come to me? Didn't they say that they had found it outside the Valley? But that's not true!
story_52012_3=You may not know. Those two people were Elders of our Valley before. Because they stole the Halidom thirty years ago, so their skills were abolished and they were thrown into the lowest floor of the Wandering Soul Cave. Then Sir Anle went to ask the location of the Halidom. They eventually escaped and their present whereabouts are unknown. It's so strange. Why do they have such great skills now?
story_52012_4=The holy relic contains the secrets of heaven and earth, as well as an unparalleled martial arts script. I think it is a common object, though.
story_menu_52000=Hurry to speak it out. Don't waste my time here.
story_menu_52001=Girl......
story_menu_52002=Girl, I have something to tell you.
story_menu_52003=(Coming to her back quietly)……
story_menu_52004=Mr. Jia, I have helped you to ask them.
story_menu_52005=Gao Chao, do you know why Shifu failed to refine pill this time?
story_menu_52006=Wei Gong, , do you know that we've failed to process the pill this time?
story_menu_52007=Hu Tianli will not be bothering you anymore.
story_menu_52008=Girl Cao Qin, you still got the Blissful flower liquid which Gao Chao gave you?
story_menu_52009=I've found what the Madam needed.
story_menu_52010=Madam, don't struggle any more. I have blocked several acupoints in your body. Even if you want to commit suicide by biting off your own tongue, you won't be able to without my permission.
story_menu_52011=Valley Leader, bad news! Just now I attended Weiqi playing at Sir Anle's invitation the day before yesterday, but I found that man was masquerading who knows nothing.
story_menu_52012=Is Deputy Valley Leader looking for me?

storymenu_52000_1=Treasure map? More like ruined paper!
storymenu_52000_2=Are you kidding me?
storymenu_52000_3=... Don't speak nonsense. You want me to find out that box? Why don't you send others to help you to look for it?
storymenu_52000_4=Maybe they have already escaped with the boxes.
storymenu_52001_1=Actually, you come for his money, right?
storymenu_52001_2=I know. You are too nervous. You are so cute when you lying.
storymenu_52002_1=Who I am, is not important, and you needn't to pretend any more. But I want to know why it was him?
storymenu_52002_2=Just because he is rich, does not mean he is evil. Calm down.
storymenu_52003_1=I understand how you feel about justice. But we should see beyond the surface of the matter. Perhaps you have been wronged...
storymenu_52003_2=It is all the more rare that you are a natural-born beauty, young lady. Why don't you stay in the back and observe, so that we don't kill the wrong person.
storymenu_52004_1=You'd better forget it. I think they have mistaken you for someone else. Maybe he will tell you later.
storymenu_52005_1=I heard you are away on that alchemy's day morning. Your Shifu and Wei Gong had been waited so long.
storymenu_52005_2=Your Shifu said you got up late that day.
storymenu_52005_3=That day you told your Master that you went to the toilet! You speak incongruously. What do you want to conceal on earth?
storymenu_52005_4=Wanderer's Flower? Is it Wanderer's Flower or Millennium Snow mountain Saussurea Involucrata?
storymenu_52005_5=Wanderer's Flower? Chang Qing? I will go and make it clear. Then you shouldn't quibble.
storymenu_52006_1=The cause of the alchemy failure this time is the lack of a very important guiding drug, Millennium Snow Mountain Saussurea Involucrata.
storymenu_52006_2=I heard that you had got some Blissful Flower. Is it true?
storymenu_52006_3=Okay, I got it.
storymenu_52007_1=It needs only a slight effort, not worth mentioning. Miss. Xiao Hong, I want to ask about someone with you. Do you know Wei Gong?
storymenu_52007_2=Wanderer's Valley's Pill Alchemist Wei Gong. You should think it over. Don't you know him? Or have you met him?
storymenu_52007_3=Okay, I got it. Thank you.
storymenu_52008_1=Terrific! Actually, this medical liquid is not blissful flower liquid. And the thousand-year Snow mountain Saussurea involucrate liquid belongs to predecessor Cheng Bin. In my opinion......
storymenu_52009_1=He died without being able to saying anything. What about Madam's promise?
storymenu_52009_2=I don't care about your private life. Madam, take care of yourself. (They say that the Valley Owner's wife knew nothing about Martial Arts. Who, then, i? this person? )
storymenu_52010_1=You have skills. Who are you? Why did you pretend to be the Madam? What did you do when you went to Sir Anle? What's your purpose by hiding in the Valley?
storymenu_52010_2=Madam, you can leave now.
storymenu_52010_3=No, don't cry out! You......you, why are you tittering? ......Madam had known that I would not hurt you, right?
storymenu_52010_4=In my opinion, madam, you should leave as soon as possible. Goodbye. (Have those Hermits hurt Sir Anle? )
storymenu_52011_1=Sir Anle asked me to find news on several people recently.
storymenu_52011_2=I haven't found out their identities either.
storymenu_52011_3=The deputy leader is looking for me. I will go there.
storymenu_52012_1=Deputy Valley Leader, don't make any jokes. The Valley Leader sent me here to inquire whether the assassin who had injured Sir Anle was causing any trouble here.
storymenu_52012_2=(……) That's good. I have been worrying about the safety of deputy Leader, now I feel relieved. I heard that those two people are pretty good at martial arts.
storymenu_52012_3=What kind of treasure is worth losing your life over?
storymenu_52012_4=(Smile wryly) Leader has ordered another important thing that needs to be done. Thanks for your good will, deputy Leader, I have to go.
