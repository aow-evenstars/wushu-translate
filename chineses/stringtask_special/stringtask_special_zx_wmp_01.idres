story_9501_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Demon Blade Elder has always been a man of his words. He has an appointment to fight Elder Hentian today, here at the top of Mount Hua.</font>
story_9501_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Of course I am waiting for him! I'm his wife!</font>
story_9501_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Although we never had a wedding, we already spent three nights at Qinhuai River in Jinling. Since he said he would marry me, he must keep his word.</font>
story_9502_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Listen</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >, </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >my Elder Sister has been kidnapped by Xue Cheng. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I am afraid he is going to violate her. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Because I am not skilled enough to rescue her, I had to stand guard here</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >.</font>
story_9502_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Yes. I will try my very best to punch a few holes into the scoundrel's body.</font>
story_9503_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I have set countless traps over a large area here. I regret hurting you.</font>
story_9503_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Are you sure you want to find him? Xue Chen is so ruthless, he even killed his master and his wife. No offense, but I doubt you can withstand him.</font>
story_9503_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >If death is what you seek, you can find him by going this way.</font>
story_9504_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I am no villain, and I sure as hell will not hand Tian'er over to you!</font>
story_9504_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > You despicable scum. For a thousand liang of silver, you will not even spare a child.</font>
story_9505_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You have killed Uncle Xue. I remember your face, and when I grow up I will kill you to avenge him!</font>
story_9505_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Zhao Ziji is my father. He is waiting for you all at Twilight Village. My father is not afraid of you, and neither am I.</font>
story_9505_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You lie. You only want a share of the thousand liang of silver, like the rest of them.</font>
story_9506_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Hahaha, you have remarkable skills, seeing that you have killed the rascal Xue so easily.</font>
story_9506_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Do not be modest. You broke his skull with your left fist, and pierced his heart with your sword. Then you used a bolt from your sleeve to pin him on the ground. He cannot be more dead.</font>
story_9506_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The guards sent from Shaolin and Beggar's Sect have seen it with their own eyes. If you must see it again, let the Emei Sister accompany you.</font>
story_9507_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >If you had not killed Xue Chen, would he have released you?</font>
story_9507_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >He is that type of villain. Are you trying to say good things about him?</font>
story_9507_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >No, I don't. I'll go with you to take a look.</font>
story_9508_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You scum, I had always thought that you were a person of honor, and never realized you are a scoundrel.</font>
story_9508_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >If it weren't for the timely intervention of the Scholars disciple, you would have torn the clothes off Sister Yifei and taken her prisoner!</font>
story_9508_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Haha, not even a three-year-old kid will believe what you just said. We are at the summit  of Mount Hua. There is snow here all the time. How can there possibly be any snakes?</font>
story_9508_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Death is awaiting you and you still dare to discredit me. You conspired with Xue Chen when you stole the Heaven Sword, poisoned Old Hero Qiu of Xiaowu Village in Luoyang, stole the Wuxiang Fingers Script from Shaolin, set loose dogs to kill Beggar's Sect disciples, set fire on the cargo ship of Scholars, kidnapped Emei disciples to resell them, killed and ate the Royal Guard's Hall Leader, and even murdered your Master and his wife. You are a ruthless, blood-thirsty murderer and thief!</font>
story_9508_5=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I left out one more detail. You argued with Xue Chen over your share of the loot and killed him. Now you try to trick us into believing that you are a hero.</font>
story_9508_6=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ha. You broke his skull with your left fist, and pierced his heart with your sword. Then you used a bolt from your sleeve to pin him on the ground. His corpse is right behind you. Why don't you check it and see if I am telling you the truth?</font>
story_9509_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You have not even thanked me for saving your life, and instead ask me rudely for my name. What kind of a person are you?</font>
story_9509_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Haha, you amuse me. My name has not been mentioned for a long time. The people in Jianghu used to call me Elder Hentian.</font>
story_9509_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Haha. Are you indeed so innocent, as you say? Are you a hero?</font>
story_9509_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Heroes and villains walk hand in a hand, and some of them are in there just to make up the numbers. There are many people who lie, cheat and con in the name of the eight schools.</font>
story_9509_5=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >It is natural for people to try to pass the blame on others for their own sins. I am not afraid to be blamed. So what if people think I've sinned?</font>
story_9510_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >It was they who killed Xue Chen. I didn't do anything. Please let me go...here. These silver taels are all yours. They have more with them...</font>
story_9510_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >He...he did not attack me.</font>
story_9511_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Hmph! I merely taught a dog on the roadside to bite another dog. There is no need to bow and thank me.</font>
story_9511_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I had an appointment with Demon Sword Elder to fight here. Fighting on the peak of Mount Hua? What kind of nonsense is this? Such pretentiousness on his part.</font>
story_9512_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ha ha, I am flattered. We country folk do not know much. Since you mean to ask, allow me chatter on a little! </font>
story_9512_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >There are always talented people around. A look around Jianghu will show that masters tend to try to get into schools and learn from masters to better themselves before they become famous. The key is to win support from elders and colleagues in school, which will make it easier to survive in Jianghu. Why don't you try to walk this path, Young Hero! </font>
story_9512_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You are right. But seeing that you are tired and hungry, perhaps you should head to the nearest town and beg for some food.</font>
story_9513_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Well, you have found the right person. I know all the masters of the life skills.</font>
story_9514_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Who are you? What School do you belong to?</font>
story_9514_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Go home, there is no more Assembly. The Heaven Sword has been stolen.</font>
story_9514_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Xu Chen is the thief. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >His crimes are too numerous to tell - all Eight Major Schools had suffered at his hands. Now their disciples are pursuing him. Now he is cornered at the peak of Mount Hua.</font>
story_9515_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I have been ordered to guard this post </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >in order to catch Xue Chen. No one else is to pass. My followers started the fight without my permission. I am sorry.</font>
story_9515_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You have remarkable skills. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Perhaps I can use your help</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >. That scum is only relying on poison. His Kung Fu is no match to yours.</font>
story_9515_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Indeed. Old Hero Qiu retired to a secluded life in Xiaowu Village in Luoyang. He was poisoned.</font>
story_9516_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Hmph! My master has sent me here to catch him.</font>
story_9516_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Xue Cheng broke into our Scripture Pavilion to steal the Wuxiang Fingers Script. He will never get away with that.</font>
story_9517_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I have been waiting here for a long time just to catch him.</font>
story_9517_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We ordered some beggars to beg for some leftover food - not an easy thing to say the least. Yet Xue Chen released dogs to snatch food. He even allowed his dogs to kill our Beggar's Sect Disciples. We demand justice!</font>
story_9518_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The Scholars have no quarrels with Xue Chen. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >But that scum went crazy for no rhyme or reason.</font>
story_9518_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >This time the eight major Schools have sent their best. We have cornered Xue at the peak of Mount Hua. Would you like to accompany us in catching that villain?</font>
story_9519_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Dead for many years.</font>
story_9519_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I am going up the mountain to see an old friend. Those damned sedan bearers have left me in this icy hell. My feet are so weak I can hardly move.</font>
story_9519_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Do not think that just because you carry me up the mountain I will be grateful to you. This is your own choice.</font>
story_9540_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >In Jianghu, there is never a better thing than to have like-minded people for company.</font>
story_9540_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >When others fight with you, you may use arrays to multiply your combined strength.</font>
story_9540_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Being in Jianghu, there is never a better thing than to have like-minded people as company.</font>
story_9540_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Let me tell you what I know.</font>
story_9541_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Now that you know the concept, let me tell you how to use the skill.</font>
story_9541_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Before you launch an array attack, you must of course execute and maintain an array. Timing and coordination between your teammates are the keys to success</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >.</font>
story_9541_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Make use of this attack whenever you are in a team. This will be stronger than your normal attacks.</font>
story_9541_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I'm only giving you a lecture. To truly learn array attacks, you must actually put them to use. That is all for today.</font>
story_9542_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Did you find anything?</font>
story_9542_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We must stop this kidnapping gang!</font>
story_9543_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Not much yet. My informants are still gathering information. Can you check in with them?</font>
story_9544_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Why are you here?</font>
story_9544_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I have been in covert action here for many years now, so I have some understanding of this organization. It is very well-organized with strict rules. If you want to uncover it you will have to find leads on their crimes</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >.</font>
story_9544_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Once you kidnap someone, I'll introduce you to the gang. Then, you can find the evidence.</font>
story_9545_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >This is what happened. The schools have distributed their martial arts scripts among their own disciples. It may be worthwhile to try your luck with them and see if you can steal a script or two.  (During a raiding activity, one may participate in raiding through the </font><font face="Default" color="#ff0000" >"Missions"</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > interface or at the </font><font face="Default" color="#ff0000" >"Librarian"</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >.)</font>
story_9556_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >A pretty young girl such as Miss Le Ru should have more options. I mean, Chang Shanzhao is well past his fifties</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >!</font>
story_9556_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > If Miss Le Ru shows any unhappiness during the wedding, I will take her away!</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Let me take care of something. I'll meet you at Jinling Inn.</font>
story_9557_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Did you see Miss Le Ru?</font>
story_9557_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Then what makes you think I'd do something I'd regret?</font>
story_9557_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >{@0:}</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >, sit down. I've heard that this place sells a new type of wine which is a mixture of horse milk wine and red tea. It is called Milktea Wine. Why don't we go get some?</font>
story_9558_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > I have no time to waste on the likes of you today. I'm off for some tea, then to take over some pathetic fishing village. Money, women…all your pathetic lives! Whatever I want shall soon be mine!</font>
story_9559_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >{@0:} You</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > are finally here. Please come in!</font>
story_9560_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Your sense of civic duty impresses me. There have been many cases recently, and I am overwhelmed. I suppose this case can only be dealt with at a later date. You may go collect some silver as a reward.</font>
story_9561_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You must drink even if it is not enough for us. I thought I could use my Kung Fu skills to rid the world of evil. I never thought I would meet an useless official who cares only for his status. Such a let down!</font>
story_9561_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Hmm, he does look funny. He has wine and food on the table but he's not touching anything.</font>
story_9562_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Hmph. I am not afraid of him trying to kill me, but I am afraid of your silly friend being caught in the crossfire.</font>
story_9562_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >This man is merely a lowly servant in my household, but he has been lacking in manner recently as he has been away. At least he has the guts to kill people. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What is the name of your friend?</font>
story_9562_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Erxia…"Second Hero". How apt. Very well, I have been out too long. Will you bring me home?</font>
story_9563_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >How dare you scums </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >hurt people on my turf</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >, and even kill an innocent coachman. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I will not stand by and watch!</font>
story_9563_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >No, I do not understand! But I know Xing Erxia has been poisoned by the Begonia Blossom Silver Needle. He won't live long. The needle was fired by that young woman in the stagecoach.</font>
story_9563_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You do not know who she is. She is from Wanderer's Valley, and there's no telling what those cultists would do. The other man has also been poisoned. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You need to use the antidote on him as well. That man being pursued by the cult cannot be just some  servant. At least he is not evil.</font>
story_9564_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Oh, my head hurts! Where did the woman in the stagecoach go? </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What is Bearded Chang doing here? </font>
story_9565_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Oh, I should be the one to invite you to my wedding. Miss Le Ru and I will be married at her home town, Jinling. You and Erxia must attend. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I have much work to do on the wedding. Let us drink to our heart's content then.</font>
story_9570_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I came here to attend Chang's wedding, and have been asked to stay at the annex building. Miss Le Ru ... she is dead! She died a painful death - there were injuries all over her!</font>
story_9570_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >He does indeed! What is strange is that everyone has remained silent about this. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I suspect the problem lies in Chang. From what I know this is not the first time his wife suffers from unnatural death. Since I was invited by him, it would be inconvenient for me to ask too much. Maybe you can ask around and find out the truth?</font>
story_9571_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I must exact justice for Miss Le Ru. She cannot die without any consequences. I must </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >find out</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > who the murderer is and avenge her. I heard it is possible to become a constable. Then it will be quite easy to arrest the murderer.</font>
story_9572_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >That is easy. Look for me if you want to catch somebody. All you need is to pay some money.</font>
story_9572_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Naturally. You can even visit the criminal you arrested, </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >and see if he is </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >having a good time there. But if you want to arrest somebody you will still have to look for Magistrate Yang there. I am only in charge of distributing warrants and bounties. Once an warrant is issued they cannot be withdrawn. Are you sure you want to do this?</font>
story_9573_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >So long as you are not a fugitive, you can be a constable by paying some money. Isn't it fun? You only need to defeat him. I will make sure he is locked up in jail</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >.</font>
story_9573_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >It is not that easy to become a constable. You will have to be qualified. There are many fugitives hiding in Jinling. Go catch a couple and prove your worthiness before we decide.</font>
story_9574_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Hmm, not bad. These two guys have been on the run for a long time, but you are able to catch them. But I have to ask you, who exactly do you want to arrest?</font>
story_9574_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Chang Shanzhao?! Please leave. I am very busy and all the positions for constables have been filled. Come back another day. But let me tell you this - an eye for an eye - I will have to arrest anyone who kills others for no reason.</font>
story_9575_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ah! You have avenged the death of Le Ru?! Good for you, I was no match for him! Let us drink to you as well as Le Ru!</font>
story_9575_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Well said! So, we will wait and see what fate holds for all of us. That's what I will call myself from now on: Xing Junke, the one who "waits and sees." I am sure Le Ru will be happy for us. But now you're in danger. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Where are you intending to escape?</font>
story_9576_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Who says monks must recite the sutras? And who says monks can only eat vegetables? </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I am a practitioner in kung fu. Where will I find the strength to train if I do not eat meat?!</font>
story_9576_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You are probably thinking about it, but are not willing to say it. You look like a martial artist. What martial arts do you know?</font>
story_9577_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Damn you, old Chang! For many years, I've heard about his sadism. When he went mad he would often hurt people. Looks like it is true after all. I have an idea. I know a cadaver control technique which I learned in Miaojiang in the northwest. Let me find a dead woman and make it look like Le Ru. You go and confront Chang. I will use the cadaver to trick him. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >This must be carried out in secret at night. You can find Chang as soon as you are ready. I will send you there.</font>

storymenu_9517_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Xue Chen did not even spare the beggars?</font>

storymenu_9518_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What did he do to the Scholars?</font>
storymenu_9518_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I see, so Xue Chen has committed so many crimes.</font>
storymenu_9518_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >He stole a sword of great worth. I am looking forward to destroy him.</font>
storymenu_9519_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you here?</font>
storymenu_9519_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >They just couldn't handle this road condition. Let me carry you up the mountain.</font>

storymenu_9541_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Impressive.</font>
storymenu_9541_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thank you again for your guidance. I have learned much.</font>
storymenu_9542_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Yes. There is a kidnapping cartel in the Chengdu area who make their living by abducting people and selling them to human traffickers.</font>
storymenu_9542_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >All right.</font>
storymenu_9543_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Goodbye.</font>
storymenu_9544_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I need information on the kidnapping gang.</font>
storymenu_9544_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >How can I obtain this evidence?</font>
storymenu_9544_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I want to join the kidnapping gang.</font>
storymenu_9545_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Is it true? I will check it out right away. </font>
storymenu_9556_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Let's hope this is a better turn of events for her. As for me, at least I was not captured by Ye Loukai! Enough talk, let's get going.</font>
storymenu_9556_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >There you go again. You better watch what you're doing.</font>
storymenu_9557_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Not yet!</font>

storymenu_9557_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You don't need to ask me twice.</font>
storymenu_9558_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I won't let you cause any trouble!</font>
storymenu_9559_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">Lead the way!</font>
storymenu_9560_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We are not here for the money. Please send your men as soon as possible to catch the murderer. Farewell!</font>
storymenu_9561_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >If that were the case, why don't you go and find the murderer yourself? The man over there is acting suspiciously. Why don't we see what he's up to?</font>
storymenu_9561_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Let me go talk to him.</font>
storymenu_9562_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Forgive me, I see you are not as vulnerable as I first believed. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >That man is most likely the murderer. Let us catch him and take him Chengdu magistrate's office.</font>
storymenu_9562_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >His name is Xing Erxia. I am... </font>
storymenu_9562_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I think it is better I go and ask Erxia, he looks bewildered.</font>
storymenu_9563_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >This was all a misunderstanding. The truth is, he is her servant who left her. She came to get him, but he was unwilling to return to her, so he attacked her. When we arrived we helped her subdue him. Do you understand?</font>
storymenu_9563_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >How can that be? We came here to help her.</font>
storymenu_9563_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >If you say so…let me go check on them.</font>
storymenu_9564_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >That young woman is from the Wanderer's Valley. You were harmed by her Begonia Blossom Silver Needle by mistake. She said she'll remember you.</font>
storymenu_9565_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Oh! Congratulations! I am so happy. Le Ru and you will make a lovely couple. Erxia and I will definitely be there. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I will take your leave now.</font>
storymenu_9566_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Do not dishonor Lan'er's memory by getting yourself killed! If Lan'er were to know, would she not be heartbroken?</font>
storymenu_9570_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Dead!! Who is the murderer? Does Erxia know about this?</font>
storymenu_9570_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Do not worry. I will surely find out the truth!</font>
storymenu_9571_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I don't want to see you getting into any more trouble. Leave this to me. Let me ask around</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > and see what to do next.</font>
storymenu_9572_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >That is all?</font>
storymenu_9572_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Yes, thank you, sir.</font>
storymenu_9573_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >So, can I be a constable now?</font>
storymenu_9573_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Very well, let me give it a try. </font>
storymenu_9574_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Chang Shanzhao, </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >the one </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >everyone knows about!</font>
storymenu_9574_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >So </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Chang</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > is a suspect. Very well, I take your leave now.</font>
storymenu_9575_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Erxia, the most important thing about being in Jianghu is freedom. Laws, factional ties, morality - they all place limitations on people. What I say or do is up to me. That is freedom. Heroic and evil, victory and defeat - you can wait and see. </font>
storymenu_9575_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Don't worry. Bi Jiahuo has told me about place to lie low for a while. You take care. Too. Hopefully we will meet each other again someday!</font>
storymenu_9576_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I did not say that you eat meat!</font>
storymenu_9576_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >My kung fu is poor. I know only some crude techniques. Perhaps master can give me some tips.</font>
storymenu_9577_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >That sounds like a good plan. Let's try it.</font>
storymenu_9600_1=<font face="Default" color="#8fd6ef" >I believe I know that cranky old woman. Allow me to pay her my respects.</font>
storymenu_9601_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >So the blade was broken.</font>
storymenu_9601_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I see. And who is this man with you?</font>
storymenu_9601_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Did you catch up with the thieves?</font>
storymenu_9601_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I will do my best to recover what rightly belongs to you.</font>
storymenu_9602_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The personal blade of Demon Blade Elder - Hundred Night Demon Blade - is making its way Qiandeng Town.</font>
storymenu_9602_2=<font face="Default" color="#8fd6ef" >Good…the plan is working.</font>
storymenu_9610_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Please allow me to finish. I believe I have the evidence to prove my innocence.</font>
storymenu_9610_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The truth shall save us from you.</font>
storymenu_9611_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Is the person who killed Sun Tian also your disciple?</font>
storymenu_9611_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Your scruples are your own. I'm just glad you decided to spare us.</font>
storymenu_9612_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Let's get ourselves out of this well first.</font>
storymenu_9621_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I know you are not happy to see Le Ru marrying Chang Shanzhao, but that cannot be undone now. Sigh…let's get going, we don't want to be late!</font>
