This is a very important matter. If there is any delay, the Nineheaven Fairy Ceremony will be in a big trouble.

Now the sister is waiting to see you. Go now.</font>

This time, you helped to save Clearheaven Palace from the calamity. If there is any need for help in the future, Clearheaven Palace will do its best to help.</font>
story_75064_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Deer Fairy was disliked by the disciples of the palace for his youthful deviance and misbehavior. Later, he did not take over the position of palace master because of Green Crane. He has caused a big trouble in Clearheaven Palace, so the disciples of the palace are more repulsive to him. However, this time, thanks to his timely discovery of Goriness's remaining conspiracy, he saved Clearheaven Palace, and I believe that everyone will have a change of heart towards him. Speaking of Goriness, back then, the master, Taoist Master Yun Qing, had assisted the mysterious forces of the Central Plains to exterminate them. Although Goriness was destroyed thirty years ago, there are still remnants in Foreign Wulin who are trying to take revenge on Clearheaven Palace. Oh, this happened many years ago... By the way, if you don't mind, you can stay at Clearheaven Palace for a few more days.</font>
story_75065_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I'll tell you frankly: in fact, the word test that day was just a cover. As for how I know your true identity, let me start from the beginning. I found Goriness resurfacing in Night City, and their remnants secretly reappeared in Jianghu in recent years. Not only Foreign Wulin, but even Central Plains Wulin has infiltrated. I do have a few old friends in Central Plains Wulin. Not long ago I heard that the princess and her husband were attacked in Yanjing City. The suspect of the attack escaped and the court is looking for him. The wanted suspect has a good reputation in Jianghu. It seems that he has been wrongly accused. I have been in and out of Shocking House and have been watching you secretly for days. I deduced that you are probably the suspect.</font>
story_75065_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Goriness has long been destroyed, but there are still many remnants in Jianghu. Decades ago, Goriness's boss secretly hid his killers and eyes in the eight major factions in the outer lands, and Clearheaven Palace was no exception. These hidden Goriness remnants have been hidden from the view. They are waiting and looking for opportunities to revitalize Goriness. How come that they tampered with incense and food?... I think most likely Clearheaven Palace has a one of them. Green Crane is also aware of the incident and is investigating it secretly.</font>

storymenu_75043_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Got it, thanks.</font>
storymenu_75044_1=<font face="Default" color="#f90227" >(Gui Shasha seems to be hiding something, but I know something already)</font> <font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Then I will go and report back to Ghost Hell King.</font>
storymenu_75045_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >A fair conclusion must be made in the face of the truth. Although I manage the Night City inn for Five Elements Palace, I have to tell the truth about what happened. The fire was a plan by Ghostface Saint to create a tragedy to frame Ghost City, so that Five Elements Palace would take the opportunity to invade and annex Ghost City.</font>
storymenu_75045_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thanks. Goodbye.</font>
storymenu_75046_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Give me a moment.</font>
storymenu_75047_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Gui Shasha, in remembrance of your forgiveness, invited me to go with her to lure out Snake King Chi Yin and take the opportunity to retrieve a large amount of Ghost Pills.</font>
storymenu_75048_1=<font face="Default" color="#f9041d" >(This grandma is really Meng's sister, and a chattery one)</font> <font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Goodbye!</font>
storymenu_75049_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Then I will write the word "human". I would like to listen to your guidance.</font>
storymenu_75050_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Clearheaven Palace? Do you know where to find it?</font>
storymenu_75050_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >In that case, I'll go to Clearheaven Palace and find out where he is.</font>
storymenu_75051_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >To tell you the truth, I am the owner of Shocking House. The day before yesterday, Deer Fairy Guest had a drink at Shocking House and forgot to bring the money, so he gave me this Clearheaven Globe.</font>
storymenu_75051_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thank you, Wang Chen, for inviting me. I'll respectfully accept the invitation and stay here for a few days. What is the Nineheaven Fairy Ceremony?</font>
storymenu_75051_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thank you for your advice. I'm going to find miss Lan.</font>
storymenu_75052_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Since you have important business, I will stroll around by myself.</font>
storymenu_75053_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Since it is a treasure of your faction, I will choose a fair day to return it. Unfortunately, I don't have the Clearheaven Globe with me today.</font>
storymenu_75054_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >So that's elder martial sister... thanks for telling me.</font>
storymenu_75055_1=<font face="Default" color="#fc001d" >(That wasn't her...)</font> <font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >There was a very beautiful-looking Female Taoist who used some tricks to rob me, so I am asking around about it...</font>
storymenu_75055_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Lad? Female Taoist is a man?</font>
storymenu_75056_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thanks for telling me.</font>
storymenu_75057_1=<font face="Default" color="#f90421" >(Extremely shocked)</font> <font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Looks like you know everything...</font>
storymenu_75057_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >If you need help with anything, just let me know.</font>
storymenu_75057_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What conspiracy is hidden behind that ceremony? Why don't you, as the Elder of Clearheaven Palace, go and talk to the Palace Master yourself to make things clear?</font>
storymenu_75057_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Don't worry, I will do this.</font>
storymenu_75058_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ok, I will go.</font>
storymenu_75059_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >This is the food and Clearheaven Incense prepared for the ceremony.</font>
storymenu_75059_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Gecko Bloodpoison? I am sorry for my ignorance, but I have never heard of it. Now that it we know that someone tampered with the ceremony, how do we stop this?</font>
storymenu_75060_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I will go to Green Crane.</font>
storymenu_75061_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Deer Fairy Guest will be back soon as well.</font>
storymenu_75062_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Melting bones? So tragic. Goriness is really vicious...</font>
storymenu_75063_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">I will ask.</font>
storymenu_75064_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thank you. But this time it is all thanks to Deer Fairy Guest. He discovered that the ceremonial items have been tampered with. He knew that the Clearheaven Palace had deep prejudice against him, so in desperation he came to me for help. Fortunately, the crisis was resolved in time.</font>
storymenu_75064_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >A centipede does not topple over even when dead. Although Goriness no longer exists in the world, it is still able to cause so much trouble... Thanks for your kindness, but I still have some things to ask Deer Fairy Guest about.</font>
storymenu_75065_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You are really sharp-eyed and can see things as they are...</font>
storymenu_75065_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >So it seems that Goriness got restless and lost control...</font>
