story_13002_1=Martial arts improve with hard works, while particular moves depend on how one executes them. For example, sword skills emphasize swiftness. The art of a sword can be profound and pure. Therefore, martial artists should practice all year round, whether it is cold winter or hot summer. Only then will they master the skills.
story_13002_2=However fancy the martial moves are, they all fall into one of the categories, feint, overt, and parry: Overt counters feint. Feint counters parry. Parry counters overt. In a duel, spamming skills without thinking is useless. Using proper skills is the right way.

After Demon Blade Elder was defeated by the Nine Palace Swordman, he lived in the Xiaowu Village for a while, and then died in the Great Desert. The Blood Sea Demon Blade Record is very likely being hidden in the Xiaowu Village.
