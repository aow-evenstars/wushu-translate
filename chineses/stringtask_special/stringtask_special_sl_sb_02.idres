
DialogID_48660=Got it!!! Tell him I'll go beat him up...
DialogID_48661=I understand...
DialogID_48662=Got it. Tell Hua Shi I'll visit him...
DialogID_48663=Tell him I'm busy now and can't leave. Go help him teach those Rebelled Herders a lesson. Also tell him to prepare some good wine for me.
DialogID_48664=I'm busy. Help me take care of those Troublemakers.
DialogID_48665=Help me teach those Troublemakers a lesson.
DialogID_48666=I'm busy now. Help me teach those people who wronged Sheng Junxiang a lesson.
DialogID_48667=The coward lied again? Haha… Go help him take care of those Grassland Flying Wolves.
DialogID_48668=Tell him I will be there.
DialogID_48669=Tell him I will be there.
DialogID_48670=I'll wait for him.
DialogID_48671=Tell him to wait for me.
DialogID_48672=Give it to him? When did I say that? I was drunk and got set up. Should that count?
DialogID_48673=Hmph! I was always an honorable person. But I was sick. I will give the sheep to him in no time.
DialogID_48674=Hmph! I won't buy it anymore! I knew that guy had no principles. Wasted so much of my time over just a couple pieces of silver. I have decided to make my purchase with that herder called Dai Gai. Can you go let him know so when I go visit him he will be there?
DialogID_48675=Really? I would love to do business. Thank you so much!
