story_36083_4=Maybe you have known what happened between us... We are together morning and night. Though she always smiles and pretends as if nothing had happened. I'm not a silly, how couldn't I know? It is so hateful that the illness came without a reason. I have asked her doctor, but he can not say anything. Thanks to a mysterious person, he told me that she poisoned an unknown pathogenic toxin. There is one thing can detoxicate it, that's Longevity Grass which is grown in Xiangyun Mountain.

story_36096_1=You are strange. I saved their lives. What does that have to do with you?
story_36096_2=There's something a little unimaginably queer. It takes a long time to make the poison of Channel Burning Powder and its medicinal materials are extremely difficult to find.

story_menu_36045=Amitabha. Long time no see. How are you?
story_menu_36046=How are you, sister? Is someone giving you trouble?
story_menu_36047=Are you Li Guangtian?

storymenu_36034_1=Servant, a beggar fell in a faint with Nutrition in front of your restaurant. Give him two steamed buns. Put the bill on my account.
storymenu_36034_2=Don't fold your hands and see others die. Give me some steamed buns. It won't cost you too much.
storymenu_36035_1=It turned out that he fled from other place. He was robbed by the bandits in here. All of his properties are grabbed. They also killed his relatives. So he became a beggar in the street. Pack ten jin of steamed buns and gift them to him.
storymenu_36035_2=Who would disguise himself as a beggar to defraud you of food? It's so shameful. Servant, pack ten jin of hot steamed buns for me.
storymenu_36035_3=You are a moneygrubber!

storymenu_36053_2=See you.
storymenu_36054_1=Alliance Leader Li asked me to take a message for you. He wanted to discuss an important matter with you in Pine and Crane Restaurant of Suzhou.
storymenu_36054_2=Er, the Alliance Leader doesn't mention it to me.
storymenu_36054_3=See you.
storymenu_36055_1=Ah! You are indeed smart. You've already know what I would say before I opening my mouth.
storymenu_36055_2=What do you mean? I'm confused.
storymenu_36055_3=See you.
storymenu_36056_1=Alliance Leader Li asked me to take a message for you. He wanted to discuss an important matter with you in Pine and Crane Restaurant of Suzhou.
storymenu_36056_2=Well. Goodbye.
storymenu_36059_1=It's cruel to leave your wife home alone because of an argument, but don't worry, I heard she does pretty well in martial arts, so she will be alright.
storymenu_36059_2=You think too much, presumably Young Master Ke won't fuss about these, because at least I won't...
storymenu_36059_3=(It should be blood on her handkerchief!) Don't be worry; I will borrow your handkerchief temporally and will certainly bring brother Ke back and leave him at your disposal.
storymenu_36062_1=What's the difference? Never mind. I just want to ask you...
storymenu_36062_2=Have you ever seen a swordsman called Ke Jun?
storymenu_36062_3=(Laughing grimly) You should make money in this way, shopkeeper. I would like to ask you again, did you see him or not?
storymenu_36062_4=Keep his bundle safe; someone will come to get it.
storymenu_36064_1=You are in poor health? You can't bear a long and tiring journey. I got the information that Mr. Ke has been in Xiangyun Mountain. It's a barren place. It's not suitable for you to live in there. Let me escort you back to Suzhou.
storymenu_36064_2=In here? It's improper. If an unexpected misfortune happened, it's of no use to find Ke Jun. Let's go.
storymenu_36068_1=Good. You are brave. Wait me for a moment. If I can't beat you black and blue, I will change my name. But I never beat people in front of a woman. You can go away now. I will meet you in the Escort Agency.
storymenu_36068_2=I don't have such good luck. Miss Tao loves Ke Jun. You can do nothing about it. Give up as soon as possible.
storymenu_36068_3=No more nonsense. Go away!
storymenu_36073_1=I will not let you steal from Lu Xia anymore.
storymenu_36073_2=Are you threatening me?
storymenu_36073_3=Go on.
storymenu_36073_4=Did you mean you would let Lu Xia off if I accept the goods?
storymenu_36076_1=！It even is empty! At last, they asked us to transport an empty box! It's doing one thing under the cover of another obviously. We are even used by others. I will eradicate your escort when I am back. You know what it is in the box. Right?
storymenu_36076_2=Will the world be at peace if I give it to you?
storymenu_36076_3=Where is the way out?
storymenu_36079_1=I striked the nearby stone and felt the back of stone was empty. It's happen that the lithoidal here is very fragile. You must crush several sides at the same time and knock a big hole which can allow people to go out. We must go out before collapsing. Then we will have a slim chance of survival.
storymenu_36079_2=If you see a hole, get inside quickly. (Tips: A stone must be crushed within thirty seconds of the last crushed stone, or the hole will collapse.)
storymenu_36081_1=Here's several liang of broken silver. When you have any more information, send a flying pigeon to me.
storymenu_36082_1=Good.
storymenu_36082_2=You are kind. We come here to find Mr. Ke. He should be safe and sound according to his ability. I will go ahead right away.
storymenu_36083_1=Can you recognize this handkerchief?
storymenu_36083_2=Young Master, take it easy! Girl Lu Xia is still safe, at least she was alive when I saw her last.
storymenu_36083_3=Have you already known Lu Xia is ill?
storymenu_36083_4=I think Lu Xia will be fine so long as she sees you.
storymenu_36084_1=Brother Ke, you are right. I will help you to do it as you are puzzled by this case. I will go and have a look now.
storymenu_36084_2=His martial arts seems peerless, but if we give him an energy-dispelling pill, it will be easy to defeat him.
storymenu_36084_3=Whatever it takes, I have to catch up with them.
storymenu_36088_1=Brother Ke, does it?
storymenu_36088_2=The hermit is detestable. I will search in his house. Maybe I can find the antidote.
storymenu_36088_3=If you refuse to cure him, Miss Lu will...
storymenu_36088_4=Brother Ke attained this rare herb with great difficulty. Miss Lu really cares about you.
storymenu_36088_5=How could you treat her in that way?
storymenu_36088_6=That...
storymenu_36088_7=Don't say it out. Consider Miss Lu.
storymenu_36088_8=I indeed respect you now, Ke Jun.
storymenu_36089_1=Brother Ke, never mind. Please speak it out.
storymenu_36089_2=It's easy. Young Master Ke, go now and come back earlier. I'm going to find the Lucid Ganoderma now.
storymenu_36093_1=Just now Young Master Ke was just as if he were mad, embracing Girl Lu's body and rushing out, no one can stop him then......
storymenu_36093_2=We heard Mr. Ke soliloquized for a long time and his sound was very light. Just heard something such as water...
storymenu_36093_3=Hurry up. I know their whereabouts.
storymenu_36096_1=What do you mean, doctor? I don't understand it.
storymenu_36096_2=Miracle-working Doctor Xue, what happened?
storymenu_36096_3=How could it be? Who is so ruthless to poison Miss Lu? What does she know? !
storymenu_36097_1=My former enemies...
storymenu_36098_1=Miss Lu, you just restore to heath. You'd better take a good rest. I want to ask you about something.
storymenu_36098_2=Who is in charge of Miss Lu's daily life?
storymenu_36098_3=Oh, never mind. I was just asking.

DialogID_36083=It is a shameful story! A few days ago, 100,000 liang of silver of Official Zhenzai just disappeared from the storehouse! The puzzling thing is that the doors and windows of the storehouse were not broken. There are no signs of entry. At the time of the crime, the on-duty guards did not see anybody at all. Oh my!

The thief must have used a trained monkey to slip into the storehouse through the skylight. Then the monkey put the Tael in a basket that was connected to a rope. The 100,000 liang of Tael was lifted right out through the skylight! That is surely how it happened! No sign of them at all. Leave no scars!
