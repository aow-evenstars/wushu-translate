
DialogID_17375=<s>Wanderer's Valley plate is located on a secret island in Yun-meng Lakes. It's like a secret tower which is easy to defend and difficult to conquer. We have no reliable news except discovered one.
DialogID_17376=<s>Should be the brewery at Liuxiang Ravine, the old madam sweeping the ground might know more.
DialogID_17377=<s>This is old news. Let's not talk about it. Go find my daughter, she is the lady boss there.
DialogID_17378=<s>I am the lady boss at this brewery. Please speak.
DialogID_17379=<s>This tree is like a sentinel quietly standing at the riverside.
DialogID_17380=A letter from the lady boss of Liuxiang Ravine Brewery? Bring it here! Thanks for your efforts.
DialogID_17381=You indeed have ulterior motives, but you have done me a big favor so I will not hinder you.
DialogID_17382=Your skills are not bad. Take this key then.
DialogID_17383=I have underestimated you. I concede defeat.
DialogID_17384=Take this key. Didn't know the Central Plains had such a youth amongst them.
DialogID_17385=This key is important, keep it safe.
DialogID_17386=Alright, wait for me to forge from these five keys a key that can open the lock which I will then give to you.
DialogID_17387=We Wanderer's Valley have infiltrated the various sects and have stolen their secret scripts. However, it is not to overawe the wulin but for self-defense against the big conspiracy and to resist the Secret Association and the imperial Court.
DialogID_17388=I do what I want, not according to common sense. We Wanderer's Valley have long spread across the world, carefree.
DialogID_17389=Haha. I am the Wanderer's Valley's agent in the Beggars Sect.
DialogID_17390=Seeing the token is as good as seeing the valley leader. So you have become one of the Wanderer's Valley disciples.
DialogID_17391=I am afraid we are nearing the ravine where there are lots of bandits. Go find him quickly.
DialogID_17392=I am too weak and have been injured by the mountain bandits here.
DialogID_17393=I hope you can kill the Blackwind Mountain bandit chieftain, so as to take revenge for my humiliation.
DialogID_17394=I did not expect that helping the Wanderer's Valley would lead me to falling at your hands.
DialogID_17395=This is a token from Wanderer's Valley. If you are accosted by the Royal Guards, you can say you are from Wanderer's Valley.
QiecuoMenu_17376=I am here specially to borrow the key.
QiecuoMenu_17378=I am here for the key. You must give it to me.
QiecuoMenu_17380=Please give me the key. Saving a life is as good as saving fire.
QiecuoMenu_17381=I really need your key.
QiecuoMenu_17384=Watch my blow! I will not admit defeat easily.
QiecuoMenu_17385=Don't force me.
QiecuoMenu_17388=Come on!
QiecuoTitle_17376=If you want the key, you have to have the ability to take it.
QiecuoTitle_17378=You alone? Come try, I will think of how to teach you a lesson.
QiecuoTitle_17380=You must ask my bug if it agrees.

maintext_2318=Which sects are neutral?
okmenu_17375=I am on my way to Wanderer's Valley. Please continue speaking.
okmenu_17376=Please tell me which tavern the Wanderer's Valley disciples go to.
okmenu_17377=May I ask if the Wanderer's Valley disciples often go to the brewery at Liuxiang Ravine?
okmenu_17378=May I ask if you are the daughter of the sweeping lady at Yongle Temple who is also the lady boss of the brewery?
okmenu_17379=It must be this tree.
okmenu_17380=This is the letter the lady boss of the Liuxiang Ravine brewery wanted me to deliver to you.
okmenu_17381=To be honest, I am also here to find out the secrets of the valley leader.
okmenu_17382=Thank you. I have my own reasons, please forgive me.
okmenu_17383=Please forgive me. I am here to investigate to save a life.
okmenu_17384=Fortunately I have done some research into the famed insect in Beggars Sect.
okmenu_17385=Alright, thanks. I am here searching for the truth. Please accept my apologies.
okmenu_17386=I have brought four keys here.
okmenu_17387=It looks like we have to inform the various sects. The Secret Society and imperial Court's power is too great.
okmenu_17388=Why do you tell me so many secrets?
okmenu_17389=The Wanderer's Valley have infiltrated the various sects and have stolen their secret scripts However, it is not to overawe the wulin but for self-defense against the big conspiracy and to resist the Secret Society and imperial Court.
okmenu_17390=This is the Wanderer's Valley token that the valley leader has bestowed to me.
okmenu_17391=How long has the hero been gone for? Wonder if I can still catch up with him.
okmenu_17392=How did you get injured? Is it serious?
okmenu_17393=These people have committed all sorts of crimes. I must seek justice in heaven's name.
okmenu_17394=Ah, I am here to save someone. This is a misunderstanding.
okmenu_17395=Not sure if I should, but thank you.
quest_menu_17375=Answer my question.
questioninfo_17375=Answer <a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03816" style="HLStype1">Shan Tianming</a>'s questions.
story_17375_1=<s>The doings of the Wanderer's Valley disciples have always been shrouded in mystery, and they basically do not leave the valley. Also the Wanderer's Valley defenses are strong, if you wish to enter you must break the array.
story_17375_2=<s>But I find that Wanderer's Valley disciples go to the Liu village below Wuchang Valley to buy wine every half a month.
story_17376_1=I am the Ghost Envoy. There are four others, namely: Corpse Envoy, Insect Envoy, Buddha Envoy, Poison Envoy. Although our power is great, but decisions are made by the valley leader and we do not understand much.
story_17376_2=He usually keeps the secrets in a box in the Wanderer's hall. To open the box you need five keys from the five envoys. If you obtain the other four keys and yet live, I will give you mine.
story_17377_1=Wanderer's Valley and the Royal Guards may cooperate but in fact we make use of one another.
story_17377_2=The Wanderer's Valley has always been independent, uncaring for the outside world's views, and even mysterious - that is why it is taken as an evil sect.
story_17378_1=Blackwind Mountain borders on Wanderer's Valley territory, and is abode to the Blackwind Three Fiends namely: Blackwind Old Devil, Blackwind Old Monster, and Blackwind Old Demon. The Blackwind Three Fiends rely on their one-of-a-kind martial skills to commit evil in the jianghu, and have become the sole tyrants of Blackwind Mountain.
story_17378_2=For many years there have been countless heroes who have died under the hands of these three demons, yet no one has been able to lay a hand upon them. I will seek justice for heaven today.
story_17380_2=<s>He was once my lover, but as he killed my younger brother mistakenly, he has been filled with guilt and is unwilling to see me.
story_menu_17375=Recent developments in Wanderer's Valley
story_menu_17376=Wanderer's Valley remaining four envoys
story_menu_17377=What was the reason behind it?
story_menu_17378=Good and evil
story_menu_17380=Ghost Emissary
storyinfo_17375=Listen to <a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03997" style="HLStype1">Beggars Sect reception disciple</a> narrate the recent developments of Wanderer's Valley.
storyinfo_17376=Listen to <a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03809" style="HLStype1">Yin Feng</a> narrate the four Envoys of Wanderer's Valley.

storyinfo_17380=Listen to <a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03993" style="HLStype1">brewery boss</a> narrate the story of Ghost Envoy.
storymenu_17375_1=So it was like this. It seems this matter is a thorny issue.
storymenu_17375_2=This is a rare opportunity.
storymenu_17376_1=Mm, so it was like this. So it is a big sect with strict organization.
storymenu_17376_2=Alright, I will definitely collect the five keys. Many thanks to you for your instructions.
storymenu_17377_1=It is indeed that only benefit lasts forever.
storymenu_17377_2=Indeed, after interacting with the valley disciples, my prejudiced opinions of the Wanderer's Valley have changed.
storymenu_17378_1=Why must you do this?
storymenu_17378_2=Oh woe! Oh woe!
storymenu_17380_1=Why have you mentioned this person?
storymenu_17380_2=So there was a reason behind it. It looks like there is a barrier between you two.
useiteminfo_17375=Use <a href="TASK_ITEM,useitem_019xk" style="HLStype1">reforged key</a> to open <a href="findnpc_new,school04,ItemNpc02814" style="HLStype1">Wanderer's Valley treasure box</a>
story_17380_1=<s>The Ghost Envoy of Wanderer's Valley is no more than a butcher, a totally brainless killing machine, but he is filial to his elderly mother at home. One day when he was chopping wood in the mountains, he met a fierce tiger. Fortunately, Yao Jian passed by and saved his life. To show his gratitude, he joined the Wanderer's Valley.
