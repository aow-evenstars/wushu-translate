
DialogID_48600=Are you surprised? This is a frontier town. There are all kinds of people here. Just be careful and you will be fine. Go back to Situ Chang and thank him for me.
DialogID_48601=My goods are here? Tell the boss I will go pick them up soon.
DialogID_48602=He needs it now? I still haven't finished packaging the food he wanted. Help me get it ready and deliver it to him.
DialogID_48603=You're welcome. The money is not much. Give it to that Old Beggar.
DialogID_48604=It's not over yet. You look like you need more exercise. Lift this hammer.
DialogID_48605=Please move aside. I'm just following orders. Don't make this difficult.
DialogID_48606=Fine. If that is the case then take these keys too. Help him unlock his handcuffs. Good bye.
DialogID_48607=We can tell you since we are almost done here. We are here to investigate the situation. There are some weapons left around nearby. Go retrieve some for me so I can check them out with my team.
DialogID_48608=What a fresh Watery Grass. Oh, one more thing. A couple of days ago those Gray Strongmen wanted to make fun of me. Go teach them a lesson.
DialogID_48609=Something happened here. We caught a couple of Meadow Thieves stealing our grass. Go take care of them.
DialogID_48610=You should go report to the governor if there is anything else.
DialogID_48611=Thanks for your concern. I'm much better now.
DialogID_48612=I saw some colorful star flowers and injured myself while I was collecting them.
DialogID_48613=The Elder Brother is looking for us? But we are scared to see him. He is going to scold us since we lost the Sect Letter.
DialogID_48614=The Sect Letter is lost? Ugh. These careless fellows. Just forget it. Tell them I forgive them, and to come back.
DialogID_48615=Elder Brother really ain't going to punish us? Thank you. Tell him we will be back soon.
DialogID_48616=I would do anything to repay you if you help me. A couple of days ago when I was passing by, the Valley Master Thief and Hundred Shadow Hands injured me and stole my belongings. You must help me!
