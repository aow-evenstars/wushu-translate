DialogID_3285=Oh please. Help me with this plan and you will get many rewards. I will recommend you to the government and let you become an official.

DialogID_3290=<s>We are fine. I heard you went to the Lord Qin Manor, so I went there to look for you. But they didn't let me in. I waited there for you for quite a while but still didn't see you came out. So I left.

okmenu_3285=Enough. You want to kill me with those lowlives?
okmenu_3286=Okay. I plan to meet a friend later. Goodbye.
okmenu_3287=It's really nice of you to say so. You are very welcomed.
okmenu_3288=On my way here, I saw many mysterious men are making trouble. Are you okay?
okmenu_3289=How are you feeling now? Take a Large Restoration Pill. Then please distribute the rest of the pills to the badly injured wulin friends.
okmenu_3290=I'm back. Are you okay?
story_3276_1=<s>You are overpowered. I can't beat you. It's up to you how you want to treat me, and I won't say a no. Come on. Kill me if you want. I will be back after 20 years.
story_3276_2=<s>You are nice. You are good at martial arts and don't have a bad temper. I admire that. I grew up in the mountains and have a lot of strength. My grandpa was a jianghu person in his early years, and later returned to hometown. He taught me all the martial arts. We heard there is a Wulin Tournament soon, so he sends me here to gain some experience. I encountered those bandits after arriving in Luoyang. They stole my package. I chased them for almost three blocks.
story_3277_1=<s>You are such a peasant. You must be new. You seem to know nothing about wulin and try to collect information. It's lucky that you are not a woman, or you would have been sold to the brothel already.
story_3277_2=<s>How funny! You are such an idiot. You don't even know who you are. Well, I know who you are. You are a little dog. Back then, everyone called you doggie.
story_3278_1=<s>Everything is ready. We are just waiting for you. The old eunuch already takes everything into consideration for his plan. He wants us to ambush the enemies and kill them all after they are trapped.
story_3278_2=Everybody is at where they should be. The firearms are all in place. We are just waiting for you the expert to start it. Don't let him down. We will bomb all of the enemies to the sky.
story_3279_1=<s>There's something that you don't know. In recent years, the king does not work at all. The eunuchs take over the power and kill the righteous people. So many have died in the hands of the East Chamber. The purpose of the Wulin Tournament is to unite everyone, kill the eunuchs and bring peace back to the world.
story_3279_2=The eunuchs are indeed everywhere. Not only did they detect us, but also they ambushed us. What's worse is that they even got firearms to kill our wulin allies. Fortunately, you found out their plan early. Otherwise, it will end really bad.
story_3280_1=<s>You are finally back. Come here. Let me introduce you to Miss Tan. She is my first friend. I've never seen a more pretty girl compared to her. When I first came to Luoyang, I got bullied by a small gang. It's her who helped me.
story_3280_2=<s>Miss Tan arrived a bit earlier than you. When I first came here, I got in trouble with the leader of a small gang. They trapped and ganked me. Thanks to Miss Tan, I was able to escape. Look. Bandits from that small gang are coming this way. Let's give them a lesson.
story_3281_1=<s>What's wrong with your attitude? You obviously are not sincere. It's shame of you. All you know is to bully weak women, and you are not reliable or honest. You are just a bandit.
story_3281_2=<s>I am not going to tell you now. You should experience the prolonged waiting. As for the last thing, I won't let you achieve it easily.
story_3282_1=<s>It must be lively there. I want to go too. Take me with you. Don't worry. If you can't defeat them, I can help you if you call me elder sister.
story_3282_2=<s>Take me with you. Please. I'm so good at martial arts. I can surely drive those evil people away. Plus, aren't you good at fighting? Why worry about me? Let's go.
story_3283_1=<s>Don't be surprised. I have been here since earlier and I knew what was going to happen. I meant to warn everyone. But they thought I was just spreading rumors, because they were suspicious and thought I am a coward who are afraid of East Chamber.
story_3283_2=<s>To be frank, Lord Qin sends me here. East Chamber kill the righteous people and harm the wulin. Lord Qin has been keeping an eye on them since earlier. But the king favors the East Chamber a lot. And East chamber has way too many members. It was hard to destroy them all at once. After we got the news, Lord Qin immediately sent me here, but no one believed what I said. I had to stay and try to save them. Lord Qin is really nice to his followers. Let me introduce you to him.
story_3284_1=<s>You are here to meet Lord Qin, right? He is inside. But... Excuse me... Why do you want to meet him? Lord Qin is very busy everyday. He doesn't have time for random people. Do you get what I mean?
story_3284_2=<s>You are wrong. Even though Lord Qin belongs to the royal family, he have stopped intervening the government business since long ago. What you heard is rumor. Stop spreading it. Lord Qin loves martial arts and meet with some jianghu friends sometimes. He is soft in the heart. When he sees poor people, he always gift them something to help. Therefore, everyone should stop spreading the false rumor. You seem to know martial arts too. Why don't you duel with the warriors in the Lord Manor?
story_3285_1=<s>You are here. I just received a letter from Mr. Wu. He speaks highly of you. The servants just now were rude to you. I hereby apologize for them. Please forgive them.
story_3285_2=<s>I have two dreams. If I were not born in the royal family, I would like to build a bamboo house in the green mountains, farm on 10 mu of lands and marry a woman I love. Everyday, by the mountain and river, I would read books, practice martial arts, play qin, write poems and meet with wulin friends with a toast of wine. However, I am in the royal family. So my second wish is for the citizens. I wish peace for the country, and enough food and clothing for the people. It's the responsibility of the descendants in the royal family. With all the citizens in mind, I don't dare to be lazy.
story_3285_3=<s>It was not easy for my ancestor to take the throne back then. But nowadays, the eunuchs take the power. They kill the righteous people and harm the wulin, while the king is too blind to see any of that and is too lazy to do any government work. There are only the despicable ones left in the government. The citizens are being bullied by those people and lead a difficult life. It makes me sad. I want to use my power, even if little, to save the citizens, destroy the evil people and bring peace back to the world. Even if that means I would be rumored or beheaded, it is worth it if I can save them. Can you stay and help me?
story_3286_1=<s>While I was waiting for you at the gate of Lord Qin Manor just now, I vaguely saw a few masked jianghu people talking with Lord Qin Manor's guards. But suddenly...
story_3286_2=<s>The guards killed those jianghu people and took the corpses to the forest nearby. I was worried about you. Thank god that you are fine.
story_menu_3276=Is there anything else you want to say?
story_menu_3277=What do you want to say? If nothing, then I'm leaving.
story_menu_3278=(They seem to mistaken me for someone else. Let's see if I can find out what they want to do.) Sorry to have kept you waiting.
story_menu_3279=Please let me explain. He is East Chamber's follower. They plan to set off a bomb and kill all the wulin people at the Wulin Tournament.
story_menu_3280=Are you okay? Everything is done? Why is she here?
story_menu_3281=Anything else you want me to help?

storymenu_3281_2=Sigh...
storymenu_3282_1=Are you joking? It's too dangerous. You should stay here. I can't protect you all if it gets chaotic later on.
storymenu_3282_2=Enough. Stay with Brother Hu and act if any opportunity appears.
storymenu_3283_1=These people are too arrogant.
storymenu_3283_2=Based on your theory, we can only beat the East Chamber if we have the help from the Lord Qin. I really want to meet him then.
