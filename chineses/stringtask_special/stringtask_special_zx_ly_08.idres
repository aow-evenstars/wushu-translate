
DialogID_13176=They are Murong Qianqiu's followers. It seems he already left for Yanyu Villa. We don't have much time left. You should hurry and go to Yanyu Villa Leader Manor to collect information.
DialogID_13177=Wulin Tournament hasn't started yet. You look really tired. Go take a rest first.
DialogID_13178=You are looking for the Japanese? They are cutting trees in Qifeng Mountain. You'd better not go bother them. They beat many people up already. Don't do it for that little money reward.
DialogID_13179=Wait. Honestly, to drive the Japanese away, my elder brother challenged him but got wounded heavily. As for me, I'm not good at martial arts. I hope you can help to kill those evil people.
DialogID_13180=Our knives are not convenient for chopping trees. We need axes. But if we go directly to the town, it may bring more conflicts between central wulin and us. Can you help us to borrow some axes?
DialogID_13181=How can I help you?
DialogID_13182=We dueled with the central wulin people for the past few days and are now not very well. Can you help us collect some wood please?
DialogID_13183=Our leader is over there.
DialogID_13184=I heard about your case. How can I help?
DialogID_13185=For real? We didn't do any of those. We must be framed.
DialogID_13186=You are really good at martial arts. Central wulin indeed lives up to its reputation. Now I don't worry about your going there.
DialogID_13187=Why did you come back?
DialogID_13188=This is my token. Take it to him and he will believe you.
DialogID_13189=This is the leader's token. Are you here to save us?
DialogID_13190=Who are you?
DialogID_13191=Leader is finally here to save us.
DialogID_13192=You collude with the Japanese and harm the central wulin. Don't even talk in front of me.
DialogID_13193=You are so young yet so arrogant. Don't let me see you again.
DialogID_13194=Really? It's the Shenfeng Sect's conspiracy? But there are already some people in the restaurant. They plan to attack the Qifeng Mountain together and kill all the Japanese. I'm afraid it is too late. If you don't trust what I said, ask the waiter Mao Fugui whether those people are still here.
DialogID_13195=Really? They are nice? You are a betrayer of central wulin. None of the outsiders are good. Come on guys. Catch him.
DialogID_13196=Your reputation is ruined because of me and I am badly injured. There is no way that we can return. Take my head to your wulin leader. Maybe that will help you get rid of the bad name.
DialogID_13197=What's up? This ... is a human head?
DialogID_13198=(Ningci stabs knife into himself and suicides.)
DialogID_13199=These belong to my followers. Why are these at their place?
DialogID_13200=Lots of people are coming up the mountain. You probably will see the Japanese killed.
QiecuoMenu_13178=You are Shantian Ningci?
QiecuoMenu_13179=Shut up. Be prepared.
QiecuoMenu_13181=Yes, go ahead.
QiecuoMenu_13186=Look!
QiecuoMenu_13187=Look!
QiecuoMenu_13188=Look!
QiecuoTitle_13178=Pass my challenge first if you want to see the leader.
QiecuoTitle_13179=Please.
QiecuoTitle_13181=Since you insist to go. Let's have a duel. We should not actually hurt each other.
QiecuoTitle_13186=You overestimated yourself.
QiecuoTitle_13187=You overestimated yourself.
QiecuoTitle_13188=No way!

okmenu_13176=Okay, I will go now.
okmenu_13177=Okay, I will sign up later.
okmenu_13178=Thanks for your information.
okmenu_13179=Okay, let's duel the Japanese samurai.
okmenu_13180=Okay, I will help you borrow an axe.
okmenu_13181=I want to borrow an axe.
okmenu_13182=Okay, I will help you.
okmenu_13183=Thank you for letting me know.
okmenu_13184=I wonder if you have heard of the rumors about you? It says that you harm the citizens, endanger the wulin, burn down houses, rob people and do anything but good.
okmenu_13185=In fact, there are evil people in central wulin too.
okmenu_13186=You overestimated me. I will go now.
okmenu_13187=Your friend doesn't trust me.
okmenu_13188=Okay, I will go back now.
okmenu_13189=Now you should believe me. How is it going inside now?
okmenu_13190=I'm Ningci's friend. I'm here to rescue you.
okmenu_13191=You should quickly leave here.
okmenu_13192=You false accuse me. Let me give you a lesson.
okmenu_13193=Hand over the Map of the Seas. Or you will be dead.
okmenu_13194=That's really bad. I have to go ask about it.
okmenu_13195=With only you?
okmenu_13196=I can't do it.
okmenu_13197=Central wulin made a wrong decision.
okmenu_13198=Why did you do that? I will revenge for you.
okmenu_13199=It's clear now. Shenfeng Sect are impersonating you.
okmenu_13200=(Oh no, I have to hurry and go up the mountain.)
story_13176_1=Some Japanese samurais came here recently. Rumor says they are doing evil deeds around Yanyu Villa. Wulin Alliance Leader Lin Tiannan put up a bounty for whoever that can beat the Japanese samurais and whoever that can tell their trace.
story_13176_2=The Japanese samurais are powerful. Many famed martial artists in jianghu were defeated by them. For details, you can go ask Qian Dahe. He always has the most updated information.
story_13177_1=Their leader is called Shantian Ningci. He is very skillful in martial arts and uses a weird blade. That's probably the special blade from Japan. It's said he is the best in martial arts in Japan. Many famed jianghu people here are defeated and injured by him.
story_13178_1=The goal of our trip this time is to meet new friends while practicing martial arts. But the ones that we defeated made rumors, saying that we did all kinds of evil deeds. As a result, our ship was taken away by the government. We can not return to Japan, but have to chop woods and make new boat to return home. Jiutai beside me seems to want to talk to you.
story_13179_1=The purpose of the trip is to practice martial arts with central wulin experts. But the Japanese samurais ended up being treated as outsiders and got expelled. The boat was also taken away by the government. Chopping wood in the Qifeng Mountain and making boat to return home is the only way to go.
story_13179_2=We never did any of that. It's a false accusation and we are framed. Shenfeng Sect are to the north west of this forest. They used to kidnap my followers. Maybe it's them that pretend to be the Japanese and did all kinds of evil deeds. I hope you can investigate this case and bring justice to us.
story_13180_1=I have some doubts about blade martial arts. Would you please give some advice?
story_13180_2=I'm still a bit confused. But saving people is in the priority. You should go. We can chat more later when you are free.
