DialogID_13276=The fortress leader is very busy. What do you want?
DialogID_13277=Blossom of the Seven Stars is a rare poison. Who do you plan to kill? Why do I have to give it to you?
DialogID_13279=This is the Useful Poison-Avoiding Water. Once you drink it, none of the poison snakes and stuff will bite you again.
DialogID_13283=As silly as you, you know to cure a poison with another. Don't move yet. Even though the snake poison remedies part of the poison in your body, some still remains. If it's that easy to cure the poison, why does Tangmen even exist? If you want to stay alive, take this pill.
DialogID_13285=Who are you? So many are here. You think you can take someone away easily?
DialogID_13286=I will take someone away. So what?
DialogID_13290=So you want the Blossom of the Seven Stars from me?
DialogID_13291=(Facing the righteous wulin people) You all think Tangmen colludes with him? Let me kill him right now. Then you can all go back to report to Lin Tiannan.
DialogID_13292=You are awake, young hero. Grandma told me to ask you to go to the Council Hall to find her when you wake up.
QiecuoMenu_13276=You are so annoying. I don't know you. Get out of my way.
QiecuoMenu_13277=Let me kill you.
QiecuoTitle_13276=Want to run away? Let me kill you.
QiecuoTitle_13277=So you are still alive? (Why does this person come back?)

okmenu_13276=Is Tangmen Headmaster here? I'm here to ask for a herb.
okmenu_13279=Why don't you mention earlier that you have such a goodie?
okmenu_13283=Who are you? Why do you want to save me? (I'll take it first.)
okmenu_13285=What is the meaning of this?
okmenu_13286=(Tang Feng? That name sounds familiar. Where did I hear it before?)
okmenu_13289=What needle? I'll go get pill from Jieyu first. Saving a life is in the priority.
okmenu_13290=Sister Jieyu. Some time was wasted because of Elder Tianxiao.
okmenu_13291=What does that have anything to do with me?
okmenu_13292=Why am I sleeping here? So dizzy.
story_13276_1=(One needs Gelsemium Elegan to cure Love Flower Poison. They are disciples of Yang Guo. Why do they still need the Heartless Pill?) Miss Dongfang's life is in danger. That has nothing to do with me. Plus, I don't have any extra Blossom of the Seven Stars.
story_13276_2=Many jianghu people are killed by a rare poison recently. People suspect it's maybe us Tangmen. To get rid of the suspect, we have send a large amount of herbs to craft cure. If you go to the snake cave and collect some fresh snake poison for me, I will give you the Blossom of the Seven Stars.
story_13277_1=It's Tang Shaoang? It can't be. If it's him, you can't stay alive now.
story_13278_1=The 2 pills took me 20 years to craft. If you peel the blue one and take it with you, you can instantly reduce the power of the people within 3 meters of you. If they are weak, they will be instantly killed.
story_13279_1=Tangmen's Snake Cave is known for its danger. It's said there are a countless number of poison monsters inside.
story_13279_2=Human? There are people inside the Snake Cave?
story_13279_3=What?
story_13280_1=Tianxiao is the elder brother of Tangmen Headmaster Tang Tianxing.
story_13280_2=Yes. Tianxing and Tianxiao were competing over the Headmaster position. I let them have a fair duel. However, Tianxing's follower Tang Jian secretly cheat and trap Tianxiao in the Snake Cave. He has been gone ever since.
story_13280_3=Snake cave is actually the rear part of the world's dragon mountain series. It collects all the nasty things. Even Tangmen's Experts do not dare to go too far inside the cave. Some disciples even claim they've found poison dragon inside. Tianxiao seems trapped in there.
story_13280_4=Since you are Tianxiao's student, he probably will listen to you. Tang Jian was already punished and I am getting old. Please, would you help to bring Tianxiao back?
story_13281_1=So it's not Tianxing who trapped me in the Snake Cave back then?
story_13281_2=(Looking maniac) What's the point to mention it now? (The man seems to be holding back tears.) I was young and listened to Tang Jian. I entered the Snake cave and encountered a giant Snake King. I managed to escape but got terribly poisoned. I'm nothing but a dying blind man.
story_13281_3=I am poisoned to the level that I myself will poison others around me. That's why the antidote you took didn't take effect. Thank you for your kind heart. But I can't leave anymore. Please go and report to her. I will just stay here forever.
story_13281_4=Poison-Avoiding Pill takes effect because the poisonous creatures do not like its smell so they will avoid the person who took that pill beforehand. But it can't get rid of the poison that already enters a person's body. You still have that pill in your mouth right? It can help you to avoid the King Snake too. You are really good at martial arts and should have a good chance to get the Gall of Gaint Dragon King. Maybe only that can cure this poison.
story_13282_1=I'm Xiao Tianfang. Why do you want to kill him?
story_13282_2=The Hall Leader Tang didn't mean to harm you just now. You should return the favor by doing the same now.
story_13282_3=After you left, a Beggar's Sect disciple came and told us that you saved his life and can't be an evil person.
story_13282_4=I was just going to apologize to you.

storymenu_13276_1=Are you kidding? How is it possible for Tangmen to lack in poisons?
storymenu_13276_2=Snake Cave? I will go there now.
storymenu_13277_1=I collect and take the snake poison from the dead snakes at cave entrance. Right, snake poison. (I walk further inside to find snake poison, as I speak.)
storymenu_13278_1=20 ish years? You have been here for that long?
storymenu_13279_1=But I meet someone there.
storymenu_13279_2=Yes, it's him who gave the poison pill to me. He claims to be Tianxiao. (Suddenly, there is a shock because of internal chi right next to me.)
storymenu_13279_3=What? (You mentioned Tianxiao is still alive?)
storymenu_13280_1=Really? He is Tangmen Headmaster's elder brother?
storymenu_13280_2=You guys didn't try find him in the Snake Cave?
storymenu_13280_3=If one is not killed in an extremely difficult situation, he will be lucky later on. It seems the poison is crafted while he was in the Snake Cave.
storymenu_13280_4=Actually Tianxiao didn't accept me as his student. But let me try help.
storymenu_13281_1=I do not know Tangmen Headmaster. But you and Tang Tianxing are brothers by blood. Why would he harm you just for a title?
storymenu_13281_2=Ah! (In the dim light, there is no sign of life in Tang Tianxiao's eyes.)
storymenu_13281_3=Didn't you give me a Poison-Avoiding Pill? Can't that cure your blind eyes?
storymenu_13281_4=Okay, I will go now.
storymenu_13282_1=Tang Shaoang was going to kill me. Why can't I fight back?
storymenu_13282_2=Just now... (Tianxing is right. Tang Shaoang didn't actually mean to kill me.) Hmm...
storymenu_13282_3=Beggar's Sect disciple...(Hmm... Could it be that beggar in the snake mountain just now? What a coincidence...) Hmm...
storymenu_13282_4=Okay. I let it slide, for Leader Xiao's sake.
