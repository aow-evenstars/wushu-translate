okmenu_73923=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >...(It turns out that the Liusu also guessed Qingqian's mind)</font>
okmenu_73924=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >That's why Qingqian didn't want to announce the truth and let out the news that she was expelled from the school early... Your choice is admirable. </font>
okmenu_73925=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Liusu...</font>
okmenu_73926=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Let's stop, listen to my words. This time "Wuding Records" was found in Yanyu Villa. After my investigation, it was deliberately spread out by the White Face Scholar Bao Xiaosheng. Behind it is the conspiracy of the imperial court. The purpose is to make the Jianghu people kill each other, so as to weaken the Jianghu forces, so that the court can further control the major factions of Central Plains Wulin. </font>
okmenu_73927=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The initiator of this incident was not the emperor. Bao Xiaosheng should have had another agenda.

okmenu_73943=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >It's not easy for you to think of this level, I'm afraid... It's even more unimaginable than this. There is no time to lose. We have to get to the gathering place to stop this scourge. </font>

story_73912_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >My parents treated him well in the past. How could I know that he was wicked? On the surface, he welcomed me warmly, but secretly, he coveted my mother's beauty, so the truth got out. As a result, my father died and my mother hung herself from a beam after being abused. I had already been taken to Ancient Tomb by my master at that time to learn the art and had no knowledge of the matter. It was not until six months ago that sister Yiyao misunderstood that Yang Xie brother was in love with me and deliberately broke the matter, that I learned the truth that had been concealed by the master. </font>
story_73913_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I was unable to attend the appointment as scheduled. My apologies. </font>
story_73913_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >To be honest, the Alliance Leader, Lin Tiannan, is the biological father of me. I was asserted to become the fatal beauty who will bring a scourge upon Wulin. Father was afraid that the Jianghu people would find out and harm me, so he entrusted me to his mentor and brought me back to Ancient Tomb to raise, while lying to the public about the death of his daughter. </font>

story_73914_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I have lived in Ancient Tomb for a long time and know very little about the affairs of Jianghu.
