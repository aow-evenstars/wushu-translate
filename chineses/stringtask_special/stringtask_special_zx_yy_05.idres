DialogID_3201=Star Tower? I never heard about it. I want to eat meat. Deer meat.
DialogID_3202=The star tower? I've never heard about it. But I heard about the Star Wine Bar. I lost a few hundred liangs in a gamble. I'm sure the other guy cheat. If I have the evidence I will sure to beat him up.
DialogID_3203=Recently I especially want to eat some high quality deer meat. But the stupid deer hunters killed all the deers. If I ever see them again, I will kill them all.
DialogID_3204=You are really good at martial arts. Please head to Luoyang suburb and collect some special Red Mushrooms. I can cook some delicious bear meat with them.
DialogID_3205=
DialogID_3206=Who are you? What are you doing here?
DialogID_3207=Didn't you know that the County Magistrate is here? Everyone on the road already makes room for the official to pass by. Why are you still wandering here? I will take you to the County Magistrate. You deserve 50 hits on the butt.
DialogID_3208=Who are the black suit men? They are here to assassinate me. Are you a member of them too?
DialogID_3209=
DialogID_3210=Even though you defeat me, you are not able to kill me. I will show you some real Japanese ninja skill.
DialogID_3211=It's okay. The County Magistrate often buys bear palms and bear meat from me. We know each other well. I will write him a letter and tell him that you are my friend, so that he won't misunderstand you. I think those Japanese assassins have something to do with the one who robbed my things. Please ask him to investigate this for me.
DialogID_3212=
DialogID_3213=<s>Japanese samurais? It's already rare to see a Japanese in the central area, and it's even rare to see a Japanese samurai. There must be some kind of connection. Where is he?
DialogID_3214=That would be good. I must find out why they assassinate me so many times.
DialogID_3215=I know nothing. I am just a spy. Here is the secret letter they sent recently. I haven't read it yet. Here you are. Please ask the County Magistrate to spare my life.
DialogID_3216=<s>Please pass the money to Hunter Zhang. Let's just say it's for the robbed bear palms and bear galls. It's freezing cold now. He is having a hard time.
DialogID_3217=<s>Hurry up. Help me kill this man. Don't let him interrupt my recovery.
DialogID_3218=The Mysterious Clan injured and poisoned Brother Rixiang.
QiecuoMenu_3201=It's a shame. My martial skills are not great. Please don't hurt me.
QiecuoMenu_3204=I'm ready. I will catch you and send you to the government official, to clear my reputation.
QiecuoMenu_3205=You are sneaky recently. The County Magistrate suspect you may be a spy of the Japanese.
QiecuoMenu_3208=Sometimes death is a relief.
QiecuoTitle_3201=You've been through so much. You must have good martial arts. I want to have a look. Let's duel.
QiecuoTitle_3204=I will send you to hell today.
QiecuoTitle_3205=Ah! Lian Xi sent you? T-tell her I have located another bandit responsible for her parents’ murder, so her next mission will be soon!
QiecuoTitle_3208=I'm ready. If I die today, I can go meet Brother Rixiang.

okmenu_3201=I will go ask the old nun.
okmenu_3202=So you haven't heard about it either.
okmenu_3203=Calm down. I will get some deer meat for you.
okmenu_3204=Okay.
okmenu_3205=
okmenu_3206=I am a businessman. I happen to pass by.
okmenu_3207=I am from outside the town. I don't know it well.
okmenu_3208=Black suit men? I am just an outsider who happen to pass by. I don't know about those.
okmenu_3209=
okmenu_3210=Stop fooling around.
okmenu_3211=That's great. I will go now.
okmenu_3213=I didn't find any Japanese ninjas, but found a warrior in similar suit.
okmenu_3214=He is injured and unconscious. I'm here to ask for some healing herb from you. Then I can ask him about it.
okmenu_3215=Since you told the truth, I will spare your life.
okmenu_3216=After I drove away the remaining people, I went to find Hunter Zhang.
okmenu_3217=I caught you. You have no more chance to escape.
okmenu_3218=He gave me the letter when he was dying. It is for you.
story_3201_1=Star Tower? It sounds familiar. I practice as a doctor for so many years and got to know many evil and righteous people. I can't recall where I heard about it. Sorry.
story_3201_2=You can go ask the Three Evil Men in the Evil Mens' Valley. I helped them in the past. You can go ask them for some information.
story_3202_1=We never left Evil Mens' Valley since we came here. We don't care about what's happening outside. Even if the Star Tower is well known in jianghu, we wouldn't have known. Sorry.
story_3202_2=I recommend you to ask this person. It's my oath brother. We were kicked out of Shaolin together. He loves food and beauties, and wander in Luoyang city everyday. Probably he knows a lot. You should go ask him.
story_3203_1=<s>Star Tower? It's probably a place? Or maybe it's an organization? To be honest, I don't know.
story_3203_2=Since you are Bujie's friend, I will try my best to help. I will ask my jianghu friends to help collect information about the Star Tower. But I need your help in something first.
story_3204_1=Monk? How did you get to know that kind of evil person? You'd better stay away from him in future. He likes to flirt with women. He even flirt me once. He deserves a good beat up.
story_3204_2=You should stop collecting info about the Star Tower. Once you know the truth, you will regret.
story_3205_1=<s>County Magistrate? Is it Fi Cheng?
story_3205_2=The Japanese? Why are they here? Is it the one that stole things from me and beat me up?
story_3206_1=After you ran away, I send people to chase the Japanese ninjas. After a while, they found some blood footprints.
story_3206_2=I think so too. You injured many of them. They can't run far. Please help to go and check. We government soldiers are not as good as you.
story_3207_1=I don't know where she is either. I am injured and can't go anywhere. How would I know where she is?
story_3208_1=I am not sure either. The Mysterious Clan has a bad reputation in jianghu. They found me a few times and wanted me to join them, so that they can expand their power into the government. But I refused to. I didn't expect they would bribe my body guards and assassinate me.
story_3208_2=<s>They keep their trace well hidden. Even when they visit me, it will be in late night. The Mysterious Clan even dares to assassinate government officials now. We must destroy the them. It's reported that some remaining Japanase ninjas are ahead. Please go kill them now.
story_3209_1=I lost the bear palms and bear galls, which were prepared for the County Magistrate. I'm afraid to be punished, so I went into the forest and planned to hunt some more. I bumped into a female ninja there. But she seemed badly injured and were hiding there trying to recover.
story_3210_1=Zhongchuan Rixiang and I are a couple. We admire central land's sights and culture, so we decided to stay and live here. But it's difficult to make a living. I only wanted us to have a better life. I didn't expect...
story_3211_1=<s>How did you get in trouble with the Mysterious Clan? Normally they only target various factions in jianghu. Why did they target an individual like you?
story_3211_2=I see. They are really ambitious. They even dare to kill government officials.
story_menu_3202=You two don't seem to know the Star Tower.
story_menu_3203=Have you heard of the Star Tower?
story_menu_3204=Why are you here? Is it you that beat up the monk?
story_menu_3205=After I left your place, I was caught because I was in the way of the government official.
story_menu_3206=What evidence do you have?
story_menu_3207=Can you tell me where she is right now?
story_menu_3208=What kind of faction is the Mysterious Clan?
story_menu_3209=How did you find her?
story_menu_3210=Can you tell me about everything now?
story_menu_3211=Sorry, I'm afraid it has upset you.

storymenu_3201_1=Thank you! I'm leaving now to find new clues.
storymenu_3201_2=Thank you. I will go and ask.
storymenu_3202_1=No problem.
storymenu_3202_2=Luoyang? Maybe he does know.
storymenu_3203_1=It's okay if he doesn't know. It's easy for me to collect information in Luoyang.
storymenu_3203_2=Thank you in advance. What can I do to help you?
storymenu_3204_1=I was in many places and asked many people, but none of them know about the Star Tower. Can you tell me please?
storymenu_3204_2=So you are determined to not tell. I will surely find it out.
storymenu_3205_1=This stupid official thinks I collude with the Japanese. Fortunately I was quick, or else he would have caught me already.
storymenu_3205_2=I'm not sure. But they assassinated the County Magistrate and thought I am their team member.
storymenu_3206_1=Bloody footprints? Are they left by the Japanese ninja?
storymenu_3206_2=I'll try find the Japanese ninja nearby the bloody footprints.
storymenu_3207_1=I see. How come you are injured?
storymenu_3207_2=She robbed the bear galls from Hunter Zhang.
storymenu_3208_1=Mysterious Clan? I've never heard of this faction.
storymenu_3208_2=It'll be my pleasure.
storymenu_3209_1=I will go and meet her in the forest now.
storymenu_3210_1=By the end of the day, it's you who killed Zhongchuan Rixiang.
storymenu_3210_2=You seem to know a lot about the Mysterious Clan.
storymenu_3211_2=They want to disguise and participate in the government operations. So that they can gain more power and eventually dominate the wulin.

story_3207_2=A group of black suit men appeared that day. They claimed that I intervened their plan and they would kill me. I tried my best and successfully escaped, but was badly injured. Then Yiner found and cured me. But I am still not fully recovered. Plus the black suit men poisoned me. It makes my recovery harder. So Yiner found some bear palms and bear galls for me to eat. I don't know where she is now.
story_3210_2=We got to know a government official. He thought my ninja skill is exceptional and hired me to train ninjas secretly in his manor. Only later did I find out that those people are from the Mysterious Clan. I didn't really mind, as long as I got paid. But the ninjas I trained kill people everywhere. After Rixiang knew about it, he tried to stop me many times. But I was already closely connected to the Mysterious Clan and couldn't get away. They beat up Rixiang this time and even poisoned him.
storymenu_3211_1=I intervened their plan to assassinate the County Magistrate. So now they come to find trouble on me.
