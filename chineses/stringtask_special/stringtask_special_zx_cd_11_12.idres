DialogID_17253=<s>I was guarding the valley entrance as usual when the Kunlun Sect attacked me by surprise. Even Pang Zhaoyu was seriously injured.
DialogID_17254=<s>Damn it, Kunlun Sect! They even dare challenge us. I'll let them witness our strength.
DialogID_17255=<s>Did you get Withering Resistant Grass? I'll prepare the antidote immediately.
DialogID_17256=You must have conspired with Ruined Valley to make trouble for us. Go to hell!
DialogID_17257=<s>Here is the medicine. Give it to Cao Yi'an for detoxification.

DialogID_17263=Nice to see you again. What can I do for you?
DialogID_17264=I didn't expect you're an ungrateful guy, so take this toad.
DialogID_17265=<s>None of your lip!
DialogID_17266=I admire you. Ruined Valley behaved with grace and ease, and will repel any Kunlun disciples who dare to put up a fight.
DialogID_17267=I hope you investigate the secretive people who have been appearing around here. The Five-Immortal Sect scout is over there.
DialogID_17268=<s>I know nothing of the reappearance of the Nine Yin Diagram.
DialogID_17269=<s>Hah, are you qualified to speak to me?
DialogID_17270=<s>Shao Yang reported that some disciples of Five-immortal Sect came and carried out provocation outside the gate. He hopes you can handle it in person.
DialogID_17271=<s>Could you help me get some wine for the visitors?
DialogID_17272=<s>Did Feng Gui assign you to come here? I learnt that he operated well there. I have a little wine and he must lack wine jars. So carry some wine jars and deliver them to him.
DialogID_17273=Great, I don't have to go to find him again.
DialogID_17274=<s>He seemed to be surrounded by a group of punks a few days ago. But I don't know the situation after that...

DialogID_17277=<s>Our miss has something to tell you.
DialogID_17278=I'm curious about your progress. I shall test your kung fu.
DialogID_17279=<s>Thank you for not killing me.
DialogID_17280=If you can cure the poisoned disciples, I will ease up on you.
DialogID_17282=<s>I just found some furtive guys. Perhaps it's linked to poison.
DialogID_17283=<s>Is it you? The headmaster rarely goes out.
DialogID_17284=If you collect scorpion tails and Yuanrong grasses, the headmaster might let you know what's inside the coffins.

QiecuoTitle_17270=<s>How dare you insult us?
QiecuoTitle_17272=<s>Wow-wa~
