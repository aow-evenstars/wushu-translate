
DialogID_56600=I got separated from Zhu Liushu. Can you help me find him?
DialogID_56601=Zu Qiao! You are back! Thank you so much! Ugh. All our food was stolen on the way here. How are we supposed to survive?!
DialogID_56602=Good thing you are here. The Cave Ghost Minions were robbing me. Help me drive them off!
DialogID_56603=This is money for the buns. Give it to Bao Wangdi. Thanks!
DialogID_56604=I will evacuate everyone right now. Thanks!
DialogID_56605=The female thief took a lot of things. Please help take it back!
DialogID_56606=Thanks for saving my life. Now we need to report this incident to the right capital censor. Let's go!
DialogID_56607=I understand. I will investigate this matter and give everyone an answer.
DialogID_56608=We must kill the guards before we can execute the next step of our plan.
DialogID_56609=That is not true. I didn't have time to say goodbye to her because I was too concerned with the well-being of the citizens. I did wrong her… Oh, I have some things here that I need help with.
DialogID_56610=This is her hairpin. Please return it to her. She will understand.
DialogID_56611=Can you avenge me and kill those villains?
DialogID_56612=Ugh… Now is a time of calamity. Nothing left to eat!
DialogID_56613=They imprisoned me and took my daughter! Hurry!
DialogID_56614=Thanks for your help. I'm forever in your debt!
DialogID_56615=The refugees are rebelling. We must be prepared. Go update the right capital censor on the matter. I will gather the troops and make preparations.
DialogID_56616=Okay I will prepare the troops. Please go slow them down. I'll be right behind you.
DialogID_56617=They levied a lot of food and stored it. But they refuse to distribute it!
DialogID_56618=Oh no! The right capital censor sent the troops here in hopes of controlling the situation. The innocent might be injured!
DialogID_56619=Yes, I made a mistake. I was too impatient and I'm sorry. Help me explain to the people. The traitors of Beggar's Sect plotted this!
DialogID_56620=We participated in this matter so we should be held responsible. I will go take a look. Also I heard the official house guards worked with those traitors. They must pay!
DialogID_56621=My wife needs new clothes. Can you help me find a pouch?
DialogID_56622=Okay, thank you. Can you help me kill the Army Riffraff Captain? I suspect that he took the Wanderer's Valley insignia to spy on the valley.
