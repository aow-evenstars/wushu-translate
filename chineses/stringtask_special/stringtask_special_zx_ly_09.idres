
DialogID_13204=<s>哼，没想到几日不见，你的武功竟然增强到这个地步。让你在尝尝我们丐帮的醉丐打狗阵法。
DialogID_13201=<s>Really?
DialogID_13202=<s>Even though I believe you, not everyone does. The day before yesterday, Master Qing Xiang came here. I heard you two know each other well. Maybe you want to visit him.
DialogID_13203=<s>For real? It's important. Do you have any evidence?
DialogID_13205=<s>It's not that simple. Can you visit Kongtong Sect Elder and ask him about his opinion on this issue?
DialogID_13206=<s>There is no but. The righteous and the evil never live together. Since you are already here, I won't let you go easy.
DialogID_13207=<s>You can win easily but you never truly hurt your rival. It shows you are a kind man. I won't find trouble on you for now. But on this case, I can't make a decision. You should go to the wulin alliance leader and see what he thinks.
DialogID_13208=<s>You didn't do anything bad, but other people from your school did way too many evil deeds. I won't kill you. I'll just lock you up for a few days. I will bring you justice. For now, follow Lin Yong to the back area and stay in the prison for a few days.
DialogID_13209=<s>Great. Let's forget about the unimportant details. If you now serve me with a cup of tea, I will take you as my student.
DialogID_13210=<s>Listen, many people came outside the prison right now. They seem here for you. I will take you out in a bit. Take good care of yourself.
DialogID_13211=This is my shape-changing pill. Keep it. Once you use it, you will be able to safely leave Yanyu Villa.
DialogID_13212=<s>Jianghu rumor has it that Wanderers Valley and the Japanese are colluding together and plan to take over the central wulin. It sounds unusual. Leave the mountain to investigate it.
DialogID_13213=
DialogID_13214=<s>Great. Your martial arts are improved again. What we just handled are only the followers. Go find their leader. Then we will plan our next move.
DialogID_13215=<s>Spare my life please. I am from Shenfeng Sect. But this is not my idea. I am simply following the order.
DialogID_13216=<s>Never thought your martial arts are improved by so much within such short time. It seems you have been working very hard.
DialogID_13217=<s>Great, you have passed the first challenge. Next is the Wanderers Valley's Array. You will be allowed to leave the mountain once you break the array.
QiecuoMenu_13201=Stop bullying people.

QiecuoTitle_13201=<s>You are such a despicable person. How dare you show up again? Give up now.
QiecuoTitle_13207=<s>You are pretty good. Okay, let's duel.
QiecuoTitle_13208=<s>Enough talk. Let's duel.
QiecuoTitle_13209=<s>Let me help you.
QiecuoTitle_13210=<s>The poison bug inside your body will kill you instantly if I order it to. But I don't even need to do that to defeat you. Be prepared.
QiecuoTitle_13211=<s>The best poison doesn't have color or smell. Just now you are poisoned. Haha, why is your face turning blue? I'm joking, silly.
QiecuoTitle_13212=<s>Enough talk. Let's see how you are doing in martial art now.

okmenu_13201=That's true. I saw everything with my own eyes. The falsely accused Japanese people are only here to duel and practice martial arts. They are not evil. Please bring justice to them.
okmenu_13202=Okay, I will leave for now.
okmenu_13203=Okay, I will bring you the evidence.
okmenu_13204=I'm ready.
okmenu_13205=I'm going right away.
okmenu_13206=I'm ready.
okmenu_13207=Thanks, elder.
okmenu_13208=Thank you for the help.
okmenu_13209=Yes, Master.
okmenu_13210=Yes, Master. Take care.
okmenu_13211=Thank you. Goodbye.
okmenu_13212=Yes, I will go now.
okmenu_13213=So the fake Japanese people are here. I must go and report to the Valley Leader.
okmenu_13214=I'll be back soon.
okmenu_13215=Get lost already. I don't want to see you.
okmenu_13216=It's all because of your exceptional teaching.
okmenu_13217=I want to test it now.
story_13201_1=<s>It's a shame. After I left Wudang, I didn't work hard but only played around.
story_13201_2=<s>It's Old Man Lin's fault. He claims that I harm the wulin. He beats me up and even locks me up here.
story_13201_3=<s>It seems you did not collude with them. I don't like those self-claimed righteous hypocrites either.
story_13201_4=<s>I am too badly injured to recover. I'm probably better off just staying here peacefully.
story_13202_1=<s>Even though I founded Wanderers Valley, all my martial arts were taught by someone called Liu Ji. In some sense, he is the real founder of Wanderers Valley. And you are his students.
story_13202_2=<s>Liu Ji was worried that he would affect you. He didn't want you to die. So he settle you in a famer household.
story_13202_3=<s>I don't know about this either. He asked me to take care of you secretly. After that, he and I are never in contact. This is the box he left to you. He said you should open it when the emperor becomes evil.
