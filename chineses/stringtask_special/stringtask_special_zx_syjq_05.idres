story_74101_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We have gathered all the Jianghu rumors about Silent Temple and matched them to the info we collected ourselves. We now have a rough idea of where Silent Temple's underground palace is located. This information is important and top secret, only a few knows about it. Talk to Zhu Yi and he will tell you more</font>
story_74102_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Rumors are going around Jianghu that there is a tomb in Qin Mountain and that priceless treasures are hidden inside. But no one seems to know its exact location. I have learned that all the people who is looking for this tomb is somewhat involved with Silent Temple. There must be more to the story. The tomb might be a secret lair of the Silent Temple.</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > The matter is urgent. We depart now.</font>
story_74103_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Based on what we have heard from Wu Yin, there seems to be others who knows about this place, and they think there is a tomb here. They came from another route and got into a conflict. Looks like there are others who have already entered the underground palace. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We must hurry.</font>
story_74104_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I don't understand either. How is this person related to the Lord Qin Manor and the Silent Temple? Looks like we need to go deeper in the palace to find out. Let's move.</font>
story_74105_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >This is not a tomb, but it doesn't seem to be a palace either. Looks like we have no choice but to continue.</font>
story_74106_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The Imperial Court blocked all the roads after you guys went inside the underground palace. It would be pointless to go to Lord Qin Manor now. The people who went to the palace with you all worked for the Imperial Court. Even Zhu Yi worked for the emperor. Lord Qin has pretended to trust the spies the Imperial Court planted in his home all these years, and used this opportunity to send all of them to this dangerous place. Maybe he wanted them all to die.</font>
story_74106_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Don't think too much. Lord Qin Manor and Silent Temple never left any evidence of wrongdoings all these years. The Silent Temple is manipulative, and Lord Qin Manor might only be one of their pawns. Your safe return changes very little. We still have much to do if we want to uncover the Silent Temple. For the time being the "dead" you needs to report to </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" ></font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Lin Tiannan.</font>
story_74107_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The influential people and forces of Wulin. Me, the Silent Temple, and Lord Qin Manor. All is viewed as potential enemies in the eyes of the Imperial Court. That's why it's only half true when the Imperial Court says it do not doubt me any longer. No one in Wulin can keep the Lord Qin Manor in check now. The Imperial Court acted to keep them in control, and to stop Lord Qin from becoming the new alliance leader. Everything is done to keep the forces of Wulin in balance.</font>
