DialogID_1102=Good! You don't look like a Wudang disciple. You dare to offend us Beggar's Sect. You'll feel regret one day!
DialogID_1103=<s>Tai Chi Sword was made by Zhang Sanfeng, the founder of Wudang, but it was stolen.
DialogID_1104=<s>I had no idea the Chi Clan would ask outsiders for help. Just wait 'till I tell Shifu about it!
DialogID_1105=<s>Tai Chi Sword had been in the hands of Headmaster, the Elder Brother. But somehow it was stolen. I don't know what's the matter, either.
DialogID_1106=<s>Taoist Jiuhe, how are you?
DialogID_1107=<s>You're the one who killed Vice Sect Leader?
DialogID_1108=<s>You're back? What did Elder Lu say?
DialogID_1110=<s>Where is Immortal Ziyang? It's you again! Our Incense Leader is already in Wudang. How dare you to come?
DialogID_1111=<s>I'm going back to Beggar's Sect right now.
DialogID_1112=<s>There are all kinds of people in Beggar's Sect. So these cannot be helped. I see. You go and see off Incense Leader Huo.
DialogID_1113=<s>I'm ready to go back to Beggar's Sect to explain the dispute between Wudang and Beggar's Sect.
DialogID_1114=<s>I have been very strict on Beggar's Sect disciples. My subordinates dare not go to Wudang to make trouble by any means.
DialogID_1115=<s>These people never follow orders and always cause trouble. Could you quietly ask them who ordered them here.
DialogID_1116=<s>I have many doubts after deliberation. I will find it out. Please tell Immortal Ziyang not to have misunderstanding anymore.
DialogID_1117=<s>The conflict between Sword Clan and Qi Clan has existed since the clans were established. You cannot resolve it by yourself.
DialogID_1118=<s>This bad-tempered Tian Jizi, he knew he couldn't hide his guilt. Yet he still asked the Headmaster to send for someone. So be it. You can go now.
DialogID_1119=<s>Tell Incense Leader Huo not to blame himself for the misunderstanding.
DialogID_1120=<s>I'm not hurt. Only my Elder Token is lost. If it gets into the hands of some evil man, then it will be a big trouble.
DialogID_1121=<s>Elder Lu was attacked again? Who is trying so hard to frame the Wudang?
DialogID_1122=<s>I'm creating the "Hundred Flavor Wine." Can you help me pick some sweet-scented osmanthus?
DialogID_1123=Hundred Flavor Wine is almost done? Ha. Ha. Fine. Fine. Fine. I'll be there in a minute.
DialogID_1124=<s>Keep in mind a few words, they will help you in the future.
DialogID_1125=<s>If you really want to learn something, find Tian Jizi.
DialogID_1126=<s>Are those people really trying to frame the Beggar's Sect?
DialogID_1127=<s>What brings you here?
DialogID_1128=<s>The Chi Clan will fall!
DialogID_1129=<s>What brings you here?
DialogID_1130=<s>Are you here because of the conflict between the Sword and Chi clans?
DialogID_1131=<s>The swordsman known as "Heaven Dust" wants you to pay him a visit.
DialogID_1132=<s>My poor girl was murdered by those criminals outside the village. You must help me.
DialogID_1133=<s>You're back. Do you know what happened to Li Laoer?
DialogID_1134=<s>Where are you going?
DialogID_1135=<s>I'm ready to go back to the Beggar's Sect and report to the sect leader. I obtained a message that Dongfang family may know where the Tai Chi Sword is.
DialogID_1136=<s>You've retrieved the book case? Thank you!
DialogID_1137=<s>Take a walk? Don't you want to live? I heard all the five Villa Leaders have some unique skills and can tear fierce tigers alive. Listen to me, don't go there to make trouble for yourself.
DialogID_1138=<s>It is still a little tiger. It's no wonder that you can beat it. But I'm tough. You'd better leave right now.
DialogID_1139=<s>Tell Yang that the villa leader has agreed to get him another big bear to play with.
DialogID_1140=<s>The beggars are so stinky. I can't bear standing here for one more minute.
DialogID_1141=<s>This is a tiger head waist token. The Gatekeeping Disciple will give you a piece of waist token for every gate you pass. Elder Brother Li is just ahead at the next gate.
DialogID_1142=<s>Shameless villian, you hurt my pet, I will never give the token to you.
DialogID_1143=<s>Elder Brother Lee must not feel well at that time, otherwise you won't win. This is the token, take it!
DialogID_1145=<s>You'll meet the disciple of Third Villa Leader Shi Mengxiong next. The fifth round is dangerous. Be careful.
DialogID_1147=<s>You're back. What...What...What is this?
DialogID_1148=<s>Those scums killed my bear! If you help me get even, I'll let you pass.
DialogID_1149=<s>It must be those unscrupulous pelt vendors who set up the poison traps! They're the poachers!
DialogID_1150=<s>I will kill anything on two legs if this poaching continues.
DialogID_1151=<s>Who are you? Don't get in my way.
DialogID_1152=<s>Ok, I've got something to do. If you can complete all of them, you pass the test.
DialogID_1153=<s>Are you going to catch another bear for me? If so, do take care.
DialogID_1156=<s>Don't be so modest.
DialogID_1159=<s>Please go down the mountain and see what's going on.
DialogID_1160=<s>So what did you find out?
DialogID_1161=<s>So, you're smarter than you look. Very well, I'll release him.
DialogID_1162=<s>Our Youngest Sister? I saw her leaving the mountain.
DialogID_1163=<s>You stole the secret letter? Those who try usually end up dead!
DialogID_1164=One last thing...I've always wanted to try the famous Jiaohua Chicken of the Beggar's Sect. Would you get some for me?
DialogID_1165=Jiaohua Chicken? Tell you what: why don't you take care of some rascals for me, and I'll make you the best chicken you'll ever have!
DialogID_1167=<s>I'm the younger martial brother of your Shifu. My disciple Xie Feng is right here in Luoyang City. Ask him if there's any news.
DialogID_1168=<s>I want you and Huo to investigate the traitor, as quietly as possible.
DialogID_1169=<s>You and Incense Leader Huo take the full responsibility for it. You must catch the hidden traitor and find out the truth of the Murder of Vice Sect Leader Hong.
DialogID_1170=<s>This is a secret letter that I want to give my Shifu. Don't leave town just yet, it's too dangerous out there!
DialogID_1171=I thank you on behalf of the people of Luoyang. Find the hall master.
DialogID_1172=<s>I'm indebted to the Sect Leader. I shall never do anything unfavorable to Beggar's Sect.
DialogID_1173=<s>What? Does our Leader know anything about…oh, never mind, it's nothing.
DialogID_1174=<s>There is a traitor among us!
DialogID_1175=Let the Leader decide what to do with Six Pockets Elder.
QiecuoMenu_1100=In that case, excuse me.
QiecuoMenu_1101=In that case, excuse me.
QiecuoMenu_1102=How dare you insult my Shifu? Let's fight!
QiecuoMenu_1103=You're digging your own grave.
QiecuoMenu_1104=You still won't yield? I'll beat you until you do!
QiecuoMenu_1107=Come and show me whatever you can!
QiecuoMenu_1109=Come on!
QiecuoMenu_1111=Please tell me!
QiecuoMenu_1116=Stop. Stop running.
QiecuoMenu_1117=Sorry to offend you.
QiecuoMenu_1120=Damn it!
QiecuoMenu_1123=Now if you'll excuse me -
QiecuoMenu_1124=Your temper will be the least of your worries.
QiecuoMenu_1126=Surrender! Now!
QiecuoTitle_1100=Go ask the Leader of Wudang School to see me. I've been waiting all day and haven't even drunk a cup of tea. Now you're driving me away. I tell you I won't!
QiecuoTitle_1101=<s>Warriors of Chi Clan are invincible! Leave or die!
QiecuoTitle_1102=<s>Words cannot fix this problem.
QiecuoTitle_1104=<s>If the tiger does not roar, you might think it's a sick cat. I'll show you the power of Beggar's Sect's Tongbi Punch.
QiecuoTitle_1107=<s>Before you say another word, try getting past me!
QiecuoTitle_1109=<s>Just try to get past me. I doubt you'll live through it.
QiecuoTitle_1111=<s>I cannot disobey the villa leader, so please excuse me.
QiecuoTitle_1116=<s>Get out of here.
QiecuoTitle_1117=<s>Don't get in my way. Get out of here.
QiecuoTitle_1120=<s>Leave me alone!
QiecuoTitle_1123=<s>If you want to know how to get there, defeat me first.
QiecuoTitle_1124=Don't get cocky. Leave before I lose my temper!
QiecuoTitle_1126=<s>Shut up and die.
