story_1001_1=That's right, it's Jiming Town. Where you came from, did you see a criminal?
story_1001_2=Oh, you want to see Old Man Lucky. He is respected by all people in the town. So, do you want to be a disciple of him? But Old Man has never accepted disciple.
story_1002_1=How such a thing happened... Do not worry, Child. Take a deep breath and tell me the thing in detail.
story_1002_2=Strange man... children, let me ask you. Has my Ouyang sworn younger brother ever made an enemy in recent years?
story_1002_3=Do not let your judgment be clouded by your desire for revenge. That path leads only to evil.
story_1003_1=<s>Martial artists should practice all year long. Only this way, can one grasp the finest skills.
story_1003_2=Hehe, you've come to the right person. Men have various vulnerable vital points, such as the those here, and here. One won't be able to fight properly if they suffer injuries to these areas; some will even die from it. I always attack an opponent's vital points in order to finish the fight as quickly as possible. There is an Evil Tiger Hill Scout nearby. Care to test this technique?
story_1004_1=I hope this news does not deter you. Although I lack the ability to fight, I can still instruct you to become a true martial artist.
story_1004_2=What!? You are the heir of Ouyang Jianjue? Your father and I are friends!
story_1005_1=The master must have a reason to let you do this.
story_1005_2=Someone has stolen Shifu's sword. I saw a few thieves stole Master's sword and then ran away over there just now. I do not have martial arts and dared not to run after them. And Master would blame me if he knew this.
story_1006_1=You may not like that I have not taught you any martial arts yet, but first we must lay a solid foundation.
story_1006_2=<s>You are ambitious. It took me years to master the Poshan Three movement.

story_1007_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >  This child has a ready tongue, and makes me feel sorry, aha...</font>
story_1007_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >  Practice makes perfect, but the process must be gradual. </font>
story_1008_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > Be patient. These are Poshan Three movements. Do I need to read it to you?</font>
story_1008_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > Because of your achievements, you can practice the Poshan Three movements.  </font>
story_1009_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The marauders called you their leader! Don't deny it!</font>
story_1009_2=You killed our vice sect leader. You won't make it out of here alive!
story_1010_1=<s>I'm not finished. You know, Old Man Lucky had never taken a disciple before. If you are his only disciple, then you must be very outstanding in personality and martial arts skills. So you cannot do such a thing.
story_1010_2=<s>Old Man Lucky has never taken a disciple. Ask Elder Jiao about it if you don't believe me.
story_1011_1=<s>Suspicious man? I didn't see any. But there is a stranger. That's you. Ha! Ha!
story_1011_2=<s>Oh. It turns to be like this. No wonder just now I heard some loud noises. What on earth happened?
story_1011_3=Was Vice Sect Leader Hong killed? The murderer was so calm that we were totally unaware of the killing. It maybe put me in danger. It's you...impossible. I believe it's not you.
story_1011_4=I believe you. You are a good man who will not kill others.
story_1012_1=I need proof before I judge.
story_1012_2=You have some introspection to do before meeting with the sect leader.
story_1012_3=The leader was so angry because of your arrogance. Be careful not to destroy Old Man Lucky's reputation.
story_1013_1=<s>All right. All right. No more compliments. Just now a disciple coming back from Jiming Town told me Old Man Lucky took a disciple with the shape and looks very similar to yours.
story_1013_2=<s>I didn't say that. After all I haven't verified you are the disciple of Old Man Lucky. Even if you are, it doesn't mean you cannot be the murderer.
story_1014_1=<s>The murderer must have been an expert to kill Vice Sect Leader Hong so quickly and secretly.
story_1014_2=<s>It's very likely. But Tai Chi Sword is the very treasure of Wudang. Who could steal this sword and use genuine Wudang's sword methods to kill Vice Sect Leader Hong?
story_1015_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You killed the old man effortlessly. </font>
story_1015_2=I didn't kill him, I can't even go inside Beggar's Sect. How could it have been me?
story_1015_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > Then, only Leader is able to do so. Oh, no no no, I am not referring to you. I mean my former Leader Lin Guangqiang. If you want to know more, you may go to find him, and he must be in...</font>
story_1016_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > That old guy always interferes with other people's business, so he must have a lot of enemies. How do I know who killed him...Oh, I remember, I met a furtive swordman yesterday. Do you not think maybe he is...</font>
story_1016_2=I saw he was wandering nearby Beggar's Sect. I thought he was dispatched by the old guy to kill me. So I asked brothers to be watchful and then we found that guy sheltered in...
story_1017_1=<s>Your Shifu went to Beggar's Sect to see Sect Leader Xiao Tianfang. Are you going to Wudang?
story_1017_2=<s>You should mind your manners when you go to Wudang. Don't be rude in front of Immortal Ziyang.
story_1018_1=<s>You are right. What did you come to see the headmaster for?
story_1018_2=<s>You said you are the only disciple of Old Man Lucky. Could you show me your skills?
story_1019_1=<s>The Tai Chi Sword of Wudang has been lost for many years. Only a few Wudang disciples know this.
story_1019_2=<s>If Vice Sect Leader Hong was killed by the Tai Chi Sword, then I don't think it was done by Wudang disciples.
story_1019_3=<s>Many people come to Wudang to learn martial arts. So a lot of people know Wudang sword methods.
story_1019_4=You can get the Tai Chi Sword from my disciple Wang Shaojie.
story_1020_1=The bandit managed to sneak into my house. Fortunately, A-Meng called loudly...
story_1020_2=<s>My daughter is still crying in her room. We need to catch that bastard!
story_1020_3=<s>It will be great if I know it. I'll take a few people to catch him. But just now I knew he ran away in that direction. Perhaps we can find some clues on the way.
story_1021_1=<s>It's none of my business how his mother thinks. I'm now taking him to make money. You're poor, but you cannot stop others from making money.
story_1021_2=<s>I cannot let you get away with this. Let's punish this guy.
story_1022_1=He, he even lied to me! I believe him undoubtedly. I believe he could help me make money... I admit I'm lazy and greedy for money, but I have never done anything bad, why they...
story_1022_2=<s>You made me realize my mistakes. You're my savior.
story_1023_1=<s>I'm popular and have met disciples from every sect.
story_1023_2=<s>Nothing very strange, but one of my good friends in Wanderer's Valley told me that he saw Devil's Door get a treasure the other day. It looked like a sword...
story_1023_3=<s>You look very anxious. You must want to know it very much. But you should also know how difficult it's for me to get the news. If just tell you of it for nothing, then I will lose on the deal. I won't make it too difficult for you. I heard the bile of Bixi Viper nearby has very high medical value. If you can get me some, I'll tell you.
story_1024_1=<s>You little brat are quite clever. You're right. Don't tell me you will snatch back the cattle for that old brat. It will make me laugh.
story_1024_2=<s>Ha. Ha. That's fine. I haven't exercised my bones for a long time. That old brat is not good enough for me. You are young and strong, so you can take a few more fists of mine.
story_1025_1=<s>It's not so easy to join Devil's Door. You have to do something really bold.
story_1025_2=<s>You fought Duan Jinluo? Tell me why before I slice you up with my knife.
story_1025_3=<s>Yes, you are right. Sneaking is not the style of Devil's Door. Well done. Ha. Ha. Now I have a reason to beat that guy. Ok. You can go in now. Go and find my brother Alcoholic.
story_1026_1=<s>It turns to be like this. But there is no woman in Devil"s Door. So I cannot test you. All right. Since both Alcoholic and Bad Gambler appreciate you so much, I'll let you pass. I'll take you to a brothel next time.
story_1026_2=<s>Ha. Ha. You're so impatient. You must be a little goat, too. We have a lot in common. You pass this round here. Then you go and find Hungry Ghost. But you had better take some food with you. Then he will get a good impression of you.
story_1027_1=<s>Since you're interested, I'll tell you. I had been a Beggar's Sect disciple for several years. At the beginning I was care-free and had nothing to worry about. But later I met the Jiao Wujiu the rotten bastard. He always made trouble for me. At that time I was no rival of his, so I quit. It's better if I don't see that rotten bastard any more.
story_1027_2=<s>Forget it. Forget it. Don't mention it any more. Speaking of my specialty dish, I had stayed in Beggar's Sect for some time, so Jiaohua Chicken is my specialty dish. Jiaohua Chicken...
story_1027_3=<s>There will be more opportunities in the future. Ha! Ha! I'll make delicious food with the wolf meat and snake meat right now. I'll show you my cooking skills.
story_1028_1=<s>Since you are one of ours, I'll tell you. This treasure is the Tai Chi Sword of Wudang. What do you think? You have no idea of it, don't you?
story_1028_2=<s>The Tai Chi Sword is the treasure of Wudang. I can't believe you haven't heard of it.
story_1028_3=<s>You are good with disguises. Call me elder.
story_1029_1=<s>Why are you little fool standing there? Come here. Chat with me and I'll teach you how to lose every bet...Bah, Bah. It's how to win every bet.
story_1029_2=<s>Me? How could I do that? I only do some small gambling. But it's true that I win every bet.
story_1029_3=<s>Ha. Ha. You little brat are sneaky. Don't you think I know you are fooling me? That sword has never been put in another place. It has always been in the back room. It needs five keys of ours to open it. I put my key in that small box; Hungry Ghost also puts in a brocade box; the other three guys put their keys in an empty wine jar, right in...So...Ha. Ha. It's not so easy for you to fool me...
story_1030_1=<s>That man cannot even drink a jar of wine. He's useless.
story_1030_2=<s>It cannot be him. That guy has been eating all the day and he cannot go far. How can he have the time to go to Beggar's Sect and commit murder?
story_1030_3=<s>Beggar's Sect is the biggest clan, we shouldn't cross them.
story_1031_1=<s>The avaricious ghost poisoned you! In seven days, the pain will be excruciating.
story_1031_2=<s>Ha. Ha. Since I know what kind of poison gets you, I of course know what to do. It's a poison Avaricious Ghost made with a poisonous herbs collected nearby and the antidote is nearby the poisonous herbs. It will do if you go and collect some Seven Stamen pear flowers.
story_1031_3=<s>How can these minions get in my way?
story_1032_1=<s>So the Tai Chi Sword was found in Devil's Door?
story_1032_2=<s>I'm afraid it's not the disciple of Devil's Door, because the Tai Chi Sword is a fake.

story_1033_1=Who are you? Do I know you?
story_1034_1=I am a prominent man in Jiming Posthouse. I killed my Father's dog because it ate too much, and you want me to take in a filthy beggar? Feh! See this man over here? He serves me because he owes me money. If she has nothing to offer me then she can die in the street for all I care!
story_1034_2=Quiet! It is hard enough to find the time to cheat on my wife without having to hear some bleeding-heart beggar spouting nonsensical prattle. You are asking for trouble so you better get lost; if you know what's good for you!
story_1035_1=What! First I come all the way here, kneel before that damn old man's house for three days and he refuses to see me! Then I wait another fifteen days and he still would not see me!! Now I come here and you tell me you cannot serve me anymore wine!
story_1035_2=Of course it is Old Man Lucky! Why else would I come to this dump of a town? Huh? That old bastard... Bah! Wine, give me some damn wine!
story_1036_1=You are too naive. You already foolishly gave all your money to my granddaughter. What kind of disciple would someone like that make.
story_1036_2=Hehe! If my granddaughter is a beggar, then I am a King! She loves to pose as a beggar to bilk fools out of their money. She is completely shameless when it comes to money. Hehe!
story_1036_3=Besides, Old Man Lucky would never take you as his disciple. The hatred in your eyes is clear as day.  You would be better off becoming my disciple. I have much experience in the realm of vengeance and murder. (Grins)
story_1037_1=Ha! How naive the young are. How could a human ever truly understand nature? I can tell you this much, serious prey is always very clever and will find a way to escape. Since the days of our ancestors, we hunters have trained to be undetectable to overcome this, though few truly master this art.
story_1037_2=My grandfather once told me that we must become invisible to our prey. We should feel the wind, the nature of all things around us, and consider ourselves as stones and plants; parts of nature. Then, we can approach our prey for the kill.
story_1038_1=Are you blind as well as stupid? He meant to kill you with this poisoned hidden weapon! I can tolerate your ignorance but I shall not suffer such rudeness! I would kill you if I hadn't given my word to my Granddaughter...
story_1038_2=Hmph. She's doing well, although I wish she would lead a less hazardous lifestyle. She is always getting into trouble with unsavory characters and as her Grandfather, I am forced to settle her dilemmas.
story_1039_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Why not! She is not an emperor. Remember: coax her to play with you as long as possible, so as not to let her make troubles! I will kill you if you can not do so! </font>
story_1040_1=No need, I have taken care of it. I did find something on his body. A secret order from the Evil Tiger Mountain Stronghold.
story_1040_2=More than that. They are composed of Wandering Bandits from various regions. They harass nearby villagers and will not hesitate to kill to get their way. Master's reputation has kept them away from our village, until now.
story_1040_3=It is possible.
story_1041_1=Her parents were killed in before her eyes. I just wanted to make her life easier.
story_1041_2=She is the only person who matters to me. I could never deny her requests. And if anyone touched her, I would peel off their skin.
story_1041_3=Find my granddaughter near Apricot Blossom Village. The man responsible for her parents death now leads Evil Tiger Mountain Stronghold. Tell her I am just a silly old fool who only knows combat; so the only way I can make things up to her is by avenging her family.
story_1042_1=I would show my husband more respect if he were not so spineless. In fact, all the men of this village are spineless. They allow themselves to be taxed by the Xiong family and then give what little they have left to Evil Tiger Mountain Stronghold. This has been going on for years and no one is willing to stand up to it. I would do it myself if I wasn't pregnant!
story_1042_2=Mark my words, one day Evil Tiger Mountain Stronghold and the Xiong Family will fall.
story_1042_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Erase the dialogue here</font>
story_1042_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Erase the dialogue here</font>
story_1043_1=Years before Evil Tiger Mountain Stronghold arrived, we were fighting with our own kin for control of the land. After we had weakened each other, the Evil Tigers took advantage of the opportunity and swept the area.
story_1043_2=Some time later an unknown Master drove the Evil Tigers out of Jiming Posthouse. It was at this point they settled into their mountain stronghold and have been rebuilding their forces ever since. They take what they want from us, but in the interest of our women and children, all we can do is tolerate it.
story_1043_3=The Xiong family were not an issue until the Evil Tigers came. Their influence has resulted in nothing but pain and sorrow. I know it is fate that we met, and that you will be the one to liberate us.
story_1044_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I do. You see, when your father and I retired, we presented our swords to the Dongfang Family.</font>
story_1044_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The Dongfangs are the best sword makers of our time. They keep these blades ever sharp, ready for all future generations. </font>
story_1044_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Your father was as humble as he was noble. He gave no name to the sword he used to protect the innocent.</font>
story_1045_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Then you may as well kill me right now. Going to the Donfangs won't get her back.</font>
story_1045_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I heard Dongfang guards screaming for reinforcements. We weren't the only intruders here!</font>
story_1045_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I'm not sure, but there were two of them. They easily took care of the guards.</font>
story_1045_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I don't know, but I am done here. Be happy we escaped with our lives.</font>
story_1046_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Stop this pretense. You were the diversion the thieves needed.</font>
story_1046_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Your words mean nothing. We will find the thieves, and deal with all of you accordingly.</font>
story_1046_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Is that so? Tell my father what you just said. Let him be the judge.</font>
story_1047_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >While we were fighting, I recognized the Gambler and the Drinker as disciples of either Cui Ming, or Duo Hun. They had to be…</font>
story_1047_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Please, let me continue. Cui Ming and Duo Hun were the disciples of Shang Heyang, my longtime friend. Duo Hun had...wronged me, and was to die by my hands, but Shang Heyang intervened. He made me promise to leave his disciples alone.</font>
story_1047_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I'll tell you the whole story one day. For now, all it matters is that Shang's disciples tried to take my granddaughter, and Shang himself is likely behind it. This changes everything.</font>
story_1047_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >And we'll get that sword of yours. Celestial Thunder, he said? I can't remember the last time I heard that name...</font>

story_menu_1004=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ha-ha, old geezer! Tell me where Old Evil Blade is. I will let you die easily! </font>
story_menu_1005=Shifu, why must I keep practicing the basics?
story_menu_1006=Shifu, I want to learn more powerful martial arts and want to be stronger!
story_menu_1007=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Could you please teach me the Poshan Three movements?</font>
story_menu_1008=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Poshan Three movements. This...</font>
story_menu_1009=Are you saying that I'm with those thieves?
story_menu_1010=So you could treat me with justice now!
story_menu_1011=Well, did you see any suspicious person today?
story_menu_1012=Elder Shi, they do not believe me. Do you?
story_menu_1013=Elder Jiao, I was rude last time. I apologize.
story_menu_1014=Do you have any doubt, Leader Xiao?
story_menu_1015=Do you know that Vice Sect Leader Hong of the Beggar's Sect is dead?
story_menu_1016=So do you know who is Vice Sect Leader Hong's enemy and wants to kill him? I have to find this bastard to prove my innocence!
story_menu_1017=I want to know who you actually are. How are you connected to my Shifu?
story_menu_1018=Please forgive my wild speculation!
story_menu_1019=Immortal, don't beat around the bush.
story_menu_1020=Your child said she was having trouble.
story_menu_1021=This Elder Brother, you must know now that most gambling is a scam. You'd better let him live an honest life. I think this is also what his mother wishes for.
story_menu_1022=Have you heard what he said?
story_menu_1023=How do you know so much about the world?
story_menu_1024=You're that cattle robbing member of Devil's Gate who commits all manners of crimes?
story_menu_1025=Devil's Gate has a vile reputation. I wish to join.
story_menu_1026=Predecessor Lech, I come here introduced by Predecessor Alcoholic and Predecessor Gambler!
story_menu_1027=Elder, would you please tell me what your specialty dish is?
story_menu_1028=Devil's Gate obtained a treasure.
story_menu_1029=Elder Brother, how do you like the wine?
story_menu_1030=I betted with Bad Gambler Elder Brother and won. So he had to drink a jar of wine and was drunk...
story_menu_1031=I don't think anything is different. Why do you say so?
story_menu_1032=I saw a villager at the foot of Wudang Mountain. He told me that the Devil's Gate had obtained a treasure, a Wudang Sword. I thought it may be Tai Chi Sword, so I went to the Devil's Gate.
story_menu_1033=Brother Waiter, you are so busy.
story_menu_1034=Sir, see that beggar over there? Why not take pity on her and hire her as your Maid. Both of you would benefit from such an act.
story_menu_1035=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Sir, I have been asked to inform you that we cannot serve you anymore wine.</font>
story_menu_1036=And why is that?
story_menu_1037=You are a skilled Hunter, please tell me how to be in harmony with nature so I can make better use of my skills.
story_menu_1038=I…I accidentally killed an innocent person. I did not mean t-
story_menu_1039=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I'm worried about your granddaughter. Can you take me to see her?</font>
story_menu_1040=A-si, do you need any help with your…em..task?
story_menu_1041=Predecessor, I would like to listen to you...
story_menu_1042=If I have offended you, please forgive me…
story_menu_1043=There must be a complex relation between you...
story_menu_1044=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Shifu, I believe you have something to tell me.</font>
story_menu_1045=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >If you don't help me find her, I'll turn you in to the Dongfangs!</font>

storymenu_1000_2=Thanks! Shopkeeper, I'm leaving!
storymenu_1001_1=Yes, I saw him and gave him a beating. Do you know where Old Man Lucky is?
storymenu_1001_2=I will take Old Man Lucky as my Shifu.
storymenu_1002_1=When I got home that day, I found the courtyard littered with dead bodies. How horrible!
storymenu_1002_2=Father is modest and agreeable. He seldom disputed with others. How could he make an enemy?
storymenu_1002_3=I will think about what you said.

storymenu_1009_1=They were begging for my forgiveness, nothing more.
storymenu_1009_2=I will accept your challenge at any time. But I will definitely investigate this matter.
storymenu_1010_1=What do you want to say?
storymenu_1010_2=Ok, are you Elder Jiao?
storymenu_1011_1=...I'm serious. Beggar's Sect is now in trouble. I'm investigating it.
storymenu_1011_2=Your Vice Sect Leader Hong was killed by someone. I'm looking for clue to prove my innocence.
storymenu_1011_3=Nonsense! Forget it. It's useless to ask you about it.
storymenu_1011_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >It is useless believing me! Well, I will go to ask others.</font>
storymenu_1012_1=I can understand you, Elder. But no one of them believes me now.
storymenu_1012_2=Self-questioning? Please make it clear, Elder Shi.
storymenu_1012_3=You are right, Elder Shi. I was rude.
storymenu_1013_1=So you, you would believe I'm innocent?
storymenu_1013_2=I understand how you feel.
storymenu_1014_1=You mean someone wants to put the blame on Wudang, Leader Xiao?
storymenu_1014_2=Now that we know the cause of Vice Sect Leader Hong's death, we should continue our investigation at Wudang.
storymenu_1015_1=Shut up! How could I do such a thing? I'll find out the real troublemaker to prove my innocence.
storymenu_1015_2=Nonsense! Did you have any allies? Tell me the truth!
storymenu_1015_3=Don't try to play tricks with me. Get away.
storymenu_1016_1=Do you remember what he looks like? What did he do?
storymenu_1016_2=You'd better not lie to me!
storymenu_1017_1=Yes, I will look for clues to prove my innocence.
storymenu_1017_2=I will not do that anymore.
storymenu_1018_1=It cannot be told in a few words.
storymenu_1018_2=I have heard so much about Wudang. I would love to see the power of its kung fu.
storymenu_1019_1=Is there such a thing? Have you not found the whereabouts of Tai Chi Sword?
storymenu_1019_2=If so, it is possible that someone wants to put the blame on Wudang and instigates the disputes of two Associations.
storymenu_1019_3=Now we have only one clue-Tai Chi Sword, so we will find out the true murderer if we can find Tai Chi Sword.
storymenu_1019_4=Thank you, Immortal.
storymenu_1020_1=This damn guy is too arrogant. I will bring him to justice!
storymenu_1020_2=I will catch him. Do you know where he is?
storymenu_1020_3=Don't worry. I will deal with it for the village.
storymenu_1021_1=I do not want to argue with you. I will take him away today. You can go to look for your own fortune.
storymenu_1021_2=It's an ambush.
storymenu_1022_1=I believe you are a filial person. Go back and take good care of your mother!
storymenu_1022_2=Don't be disgusting. Just follow me to go back.
storymenu_1023_1=Has anything strange happened?
storymenu_1023_2=A sword? What sword? Tell me!
storymenu_1023_3=Ok, I'll come back in a moment.
storymenu_1024_1=Bingo! You're so clever!
storymenu_1024_2=In addition to committing all manners of crimes, you Devil's Gate people are quite over confident!
storymenu_1025_1=Brave...I heavily beat a guy from your Devil's Gate just now named Duan Jinluo. Can this be called nerve?
storymenu_1025_2=The Devil's Gate is openly evil. Duan Jinluo is insidious, which shames our sect.
storymenu_1025_3=Thanks a lot, Elder Brother!
storymenu_1026_1=Do not lie to me, elder!
storymenu_1026_2=Thank you for the advice, elder.
storymenu_1027_1=I did not know you had such a period of bitter experience, Elder!
storymenu_1027_2=That makes my mouth water, elder. I would have snatched a few chickens for you if I had known.
storymenu_1027_3=I will come back soon to enjoy your cooking, elder.
storymenu_1028_1=...Tai Chi Sword? Is it powerful?
storymenu_1028_2=I'm from a small town, so I'm ignorant. Could you broaden my horizons?
storymenu_1028_3=Thank you for your patience, Elder Brother! Then Elder Brother Hungry Ghost is waiting for me to eat together. I am leaving now.
storymenu_1029_1=Elder Brother, you are sure to win every time. Well, did you win the Tai Chi Sword of Devil's Gate?
storymenu_1029_2=The Tai Chi sword was moved. The greedy elder moved it.
storymenu_1029_3=Elder Brother, I couldn't deceive you and I lost the game. Why did you fall asleep?
storymenu_1030_1=Vice Sect Leader Hong was killed. Did you exact vengeance?
storymenu_1030_2=Did the Devil's Gate disciples do it?
storymenu_1030_3=Elder Brother, you are right. I'm too superficial!
storymenu_1031_1=What should I do? Do you know the antidote to this poison?
storymenu_1031_2=Thank you, but those from Devil's Gate will rush over at any moment and you...
storymenu_1031_3=I think you must be an expert, Elder. I am going to collect herbs.
storymenu_1032_1=Indeed I joined Devil's Door on purpose and found out the whereabouts of Tai Chi Sword after I obtained the trust of the Five Ghosts. But I've found out it could not be the disciple of Devil's Door that killed Vice Sect Leader Hong...
storymenu_1032_2=What? This Tai Chi Sword is a fake?
storymenu_1032_3=I thought there was more progress.
storymenu_1033_1=I am a Waiter and Shopkeeper asked me to send rice to you!
storymenu_1034_1=I see you are nothing but a brute in fancy robes.
storymenu_1034_2=Disgusting. How can you live with yourself?
storymenu_1035_1=<font face="Default" color="#8fd6ef" >(Old man? Could it be him?)</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > This old man you mentioned, would that be Old Man Lucky?</font>
storymenu_1035_2=<font face="Default" color="#8fd6ef" >(It seems he knows where Old Man Lucky resides. Unfortunately I don't think he is willing to tell me after our altercation)</font>
storymenu_1036_1=You mean that beggar girl? What's so foolish about helping a poor beggar?
storymenu_1036_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">Oh...</font><font face="Default" color="#8fd6ef"> (It was a ruse! How low!)</font>
