DialogID_3302=There are 3 hall leaders in the Twelve Linked Fortress. You can go close to them and sneak in the fortress. The first hall leader Jian Jiutian likes to craft pills. The pills made from snake galls can help inner cultivation. You can go to the Snake Cave to find some and bribe him.
DialogID_3303=
DialogID_3304=So you promised. Keep that in mind. Here is some Daughter's Wine for you. It is of high quality and has a nice aroma.
DialogID_3305=<s>Nice to meet you. I was just worried that there is no one to help me collect herb from the Snake Cave. Let's become friends.
DialogID_3306=<s>(Have a smell at the Daughter's Wine.) Nice wine. What a nice gift. You are under my protection in Twelve Linked Fortress from now on.
DialogID_3307=<s>You did me the favor for a reason. What do you want?
DialogID_3308=
DialogID_3309=<s>The snakes in the Snake Cave are all extremely poisonous, especially the King Snake. Please be careful. I collected some information about the King Snake from the snake farmers in village earlier. The King Snake doesn't appear in front of people normally. Whenever it appears, it's together with a female snake. You can go kill the female snake and lure the King Snake to come out.
DialogID_3310=
DialogID_3311=<s>I'm okay. Don't worry. You can take a tour in the Twelve Linked Fortress first. I will come back and talk to you later.
DialogID_3312=
DialogID_3313=<s>They want to bully me just with the few of themselves?
DialogID_3314=<s>The Star Tower is a secret in jianghu. People rarely talks about it. But if you can go give a lesson to the disrespectful trouble-making disciples, I will tell you.
DialogID_3315=<s>Wise men will avoid obvious harms. Guys, let's leave for now.
DialogID_3316=
DialogID_3317=Even though Shi Huhu and the Coffin Old Man are both from the Mysterious Clan, they don't get along because of personality differences. We can use that to create internal conflicts between them. Shi Huhu likes his disciple Guo Jiu a lot. You can disguise as Coffin Old Man's follower and go make trouble.
DialogID_3318=<s>With him alone? He over-estimates himself. I will wait for him here.
QiecuoMenu_3302=I am not afraid of you.
QiecuoMenu_3304=Hi guys, do you mind sharing the nice wine with me?
QiecuoMenu_3309=I'm ready.
QiecuoMenu_3312=The coffin old man sends me here to give you a lesson. Don't be so arrogant and bullying from now on.
QiecuoMenu_3313=Let's test.
QiecuoMenu_3314=Accept my moves.
QiecuoTitle_3302=<s>Since you said that, I won't go easy on you.
QiecuoTitle_3304=<s>What? You want my wine? It's my treasure. I will kill anyone who want it.
QiecuoTitle_3309=<s>You don't need to know, since you are dead soon. I will kill you myself.
QiecuoTitle_3312=It's not a surprise the monk can't wait anymore.
QiecuoTitle_3313=<s>You overestimate yourself. You can't kill me.
QiecuoTitle_3314=<s>I will kill you.
