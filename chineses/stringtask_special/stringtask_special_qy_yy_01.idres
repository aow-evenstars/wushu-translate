DialogID_33105=<s>A group of Japanese Swordswomen came here and smashed our stall without saying a word. Look, my calligraphies and paintings are all damaged. What should I do now?...
DialogID_33106=<s>I learned of my mistake. I was confused but now that I have a clear head I know how wrong I was. It was fortunate that you are talented in martial arts and corrected me or else I would had done wrong to the people of Yanyu Villa.

DialogID_33220=<s>Give me the Tea Leaves first. Else the master will be mad.
DialogID_33221=<s>You must be sent here by Yaling since you have this Confidential Letter.
DialogID_33222=<s>The Spun Gold Lash is indeed in the hands of the Leader. But it is a well-guarded secret. I have only seen it once.
DialogID_33223_1=<s>I think it's best if we take care of those disobedient members in secret. So it does not disturb the others.
DialogID_33224_2=<s>Those members are so disobedient. We must make an example out of them so no one else dares to trade salt in secret.
DialogID_33225_3=<s>I will do as you say.
DialogID_33226=<s>I did recently purchase a "Military Strategy Painting - Fenghou's Eight Formation". Such a surprise even a person from Wulin like you knew about it.
DialogID_33227=<s>I thought I could give this "Military Strategy Painting - Fenghou's Eight Formation" to my son to study. I did not know it was this profound.
DialogID_33228=<s>Country Gentleman Jiang wants to forge the Longquan Sword? That is strange.
DialogID_33229=<s>This Longquan Sword looks exquisite to me even though I know nothing about weapons.
DialogID_33230=<s>I finally got this "Military Strategy Painting - Fenghou's Eight Formation" back.
DialogID_33231=<s>Do not come any closer. I am innocent.
DialogID_33232=<s>I did not know it will have this much effect.
DialogID_33233=<s>It is good that you are willing to pay your dues. But you didn't need to act so recklessly before either.
DialogID_33234=<s>Put the bucket on the ground. I will fill it with water after I am done working.
DialogID_33235=<s>Give me the kettle. I will boil the water.

story_33100_1=I was just a Cloth Merchant in Yanyu Villa. My products were better and cheaper than those of Bad Merchant's next door, so I took over all his customers. But who knew he would hire some criminals and burn down my house.
story_33100_2=When I thought all hope was lost, a hero came to help me. He is a great warrior and took care of those criminals with ease. He also gave me a token and told me if I need help again, I can use it to find him.
story_33100_3=Yes, he is a good man. They burned down my house, but I still have my shop. I made a living by doing smaller businesses and it was alright.
story_33100_4=After a couple of years that Bad Merchant and his goons came back. They not only burned down my house again, but also burned down my shop. I tried to use that token, but no one showed up. I could only watch how everything I had turned into ashes.
story_33100_5=How much I hoped that he would show up to help me when I used that token. But he never came. Maybe he is in trouble himself. After that I lost everything and became a beggar. If not for the villagers nearby I would have died of hunger.
story_33101_1=You schemer! Who knew you would work with Tian Wudao and plot against me? You have no shame.
story_33101_2=What reunion? He is not my brother. He tricked me into going to the wilds and wants to get handsy. Luckily I saw through his plan and escaped. Else it would have been tragic.
story_33101_3=Action speaks louder than words. I will believe you were used if you agree to help me teach that villain a lesson.
story_33102_1=<s>Your martial arts are not bad. You can be considered a talent. But you are too inexperienced. If I wasn't injured, you could only take five moves from me.
story_33102_2=<s>Many years ago in Old Dragon Temple I got surrounded by experts of Silent Temple and injured my legs. But I did not want to die from their hands so I jumped off the cliff. Who knew I was not meant to die and landed here. Too bad my legs are broken so I can't use Flying Skills anymore. That token you have is mine. Who knew you would help Tao Xiaoyan for me and bring me back this token. This must be fate! Cough...
story_33102_3=<s>I'm okay. Fate brought us together and I do not want my knowledge to die with me. Go bring over that Tendon Changing Sutra on the rock over there. I will pass you my Inner Skill and I hope you will punish evil and uphold justice from now on. I'll take this token back.
story_33201_1=It is rumored there were two Song brothers. They were well-educated and lived near the West Lake by fishing. On one of his trips the local bully Officer Zhao saw a beautiful woman doing laundry near the lake and wanted her badly. He later learned this woman is the wife of the big Song brother. So he used an evil plot and killed him.
story_33201_2=The younger Song brother and his sister-in-law were angered by what happened. So they reported the crime to the government and asked for justice. What they did not know was that the government was on Officer Zhao's side. Instead of getting justice they were badly beaten and banished.
story_33201_3=After they came back home the wife of the big Song brother told the young brother to gather his belongings and leave town before the bully comes looking for vengeance. Before his departure she also cooked a bowl of fish. It was made in a special way with sugar and vinegar. The younger Song brother asked his sister-in-law: "Why the fish is cooked this way today?" The sister-in-law replied: "This fish is sweet and sour. I want you to remember what happened to your brother. If you live a sweet life then do not forget the sourness of the people when they are bullied." The young brother was moved by his sister-in-law's words. He ate the fish and left while remembering her lesson.
story_33201_4=Later the younger Song brother became a governor and came back to Hangzhou. He avenged his brother and punished the bully. But his sister-in-law was already gone and couldn't be found. One time when the young brother was joining a feast he ate a fish that tasted just like the one he ate when he left home. He asked who was the cook and found out it was his sister-in-law. He learned that after he left his sister-in-law worked as a chef in another governor's residence to hide from the bully. The young brother is happy he finally found his sister-in-law so he quit his job and returned home with her.
