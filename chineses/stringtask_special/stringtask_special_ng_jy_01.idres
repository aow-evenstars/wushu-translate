story_83507_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You said Gong Dadan sold you this painting? ha ha. You. Gong Dadan is famous for selling fakes; 99 of 100 of his things are fakes, and only the real one is not his.</font>

story_83509_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Actually I don't know much about it. A mute came to me lately, and he gives me a note every time he sees me. The assignment is written on the note, and he'll beat me up if I don't do it. That mute possesses great Kung Fu skill, and he defeated me easily. I had to act according to his orders, because my life is more important.</font>
story_83509_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >He made me leak the news about this trade. The thing was just a facade, and is different every time. The purpose was to expose the person who conducted the investigation. But that idiot Dadan spoiled the plan. He is useless and can only earn a living selling fakes. He has no ambition. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I must teach him a good lesson.</font>
story_83509_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I'm done once I draw them out. I'll only take care of spreading news and making contact. After seeing the thing being exchanged by Dadan, </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >the mute might be afraid of being exposed. He hasn't appeared again for a few days. But I know where he is. Heh-heh. One time I followed him and saw him taking a break in the southern outskirts of Yanjing. You'd better kill him so he won't come to see me all the time. He killed some people from the Royal Guards. Don't show any mercy.</font>
story_83510_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >That's right. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I found out Miracle Hand Jiangnan tried to steal from the Imperial Court. But there are many Experts in the Court, there's no way she could have succeeded. She wasn't captured after the failed theft, and she disappeared afterward. According to the tip-off I just received, she retired from thieving and later came to Yanjing. Because she is good at disguises, no one can find out her whereabouts.</font>
story_83510_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Another person also mentioned in the clues is Zhao Cangfeng, the New Punishment Hall Leader of the Royal Guards. It is said that he is connected with the Schools' stolen treasures. But because he is the East Chamber Master's right-hand man, be sure to be careful when investigating. It will injure the Royal Guards if he's alerted. That's why I didn't disclose any details in my letter</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >. Be very careful when you investigate.</font>
story_83511_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Jiangnan? You mean Qiao Linglong, right? She has disappeared for a long time. Why are you </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >looking </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >for her?</font>
story_83511_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >She was an orphan, adopted when she was young. She grew up petite and pretty, so she is called Qiao Linglong. Because she was active in Jiangnan area, people in Jianghu called her Clever Hands Jiangnan. Who are you? Why are you asking this?</font>
story_83511_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Don't ask me. I want to find her myself. She wouldn't have built up such a reputation if I hadn’t helped to sell the stolen goods. She didn't want anything to do with me all of a sudden. I know she was hanging out with The Eight-Faced Buddha. But now I don't sell stolen goods; I only do legitimate business. What do you want by asking so many questions? Get lost. Otherwise don't blame me for being mean to you.</font>
story_83512_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Don't hit me, don't hit me. I have told you everything. The Eight-Faced Buddha was her lover, and he took Ling Long under his wing. I knew there was something going on between those two. I saw them together once. Damn. I wasted my time treating her so well. I moved heaven and earth selling stolen goods for high prices for her. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >And she never paid me the least bit of attention.</font>
story_83513_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The Eight-Faced Buddha? No wonder there's a Jianghu saying "Miracle Hand Fo, Bamian's Ling Long." It's about </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >them</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >! The Eight-Faced Buddha disappeared? Why has the Court always spread rumors that only Miracle Hand Jiangnan was doing the stealing? How did the Court let a Thief escape? The Eight-Faced Buddha must have been captured. Let me think.</font>
story_83513_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The East Chamber Master was in charge in the Court back then. The Eight-Faced Buddha possessed great Kung Fu skill and there is no reason why he would be killed that easily. Not to mention the news was smothered. It looks like that The Eight-Faced Buddha isn’t dead, and instead he was bought by the East Chamber Master. I already knew who The Eight-Faced Buddha was.</font>
story_83515_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Zhao Cangfeng! Hmm. He is only the East Chamber Master's hired thug. He didn't uphold his honor and has no shame. I was very faithful to him, but he framed me when he screwed up. I would've died if Commander Huangfu hadn’t stood by me. I hope Zhao Cangfeng has a very bad end.</font>
story_83515_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I don't know how he joined the Royal Guards. When I was under his command, he was already the East Chamber Master's most trusted follower. The East Chamber Master treated him very well. We all called him the East Chamber Master's godson in private.</font>
story_83516_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The Royal Guards are our East Chamber's worst enemy. If not for the fact that Commander Huangfu treated me well many years ago, I would've arrested you. You are not going to get any information from me.</font>

The last time I was at the East Chamber, I overheard the Wala ambassador talking to the Chamber leader about eliminating the Royal Guards. The emperor was mentioned as well but I couldn't make out what was said. It was the ambassador who told me to poison the Royal Guards' physicians. That's all I know, please spare me! </font>
story_83534_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You did well, my brethren can rest in peace. Still, the emperor no longer trusts Royal Guards. That is an issue that must be rectified. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Did the traitor reveal any other information? </font>
story_83534_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >hmmm, why did he want to poison the old physicians in the physician chamber? They were all retired and had no direct connection to the Royal Guards. Sure they were all quite skilled in detoxification but...detoxification? They must be planning to poison the emperor! This is serious. Go to Jinling</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >and find the Royal Guards' spy</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >. </font>

story_83536_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Looks like the East Chamber is planning something big. Unfortunately we do not have hard proof yet. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > For now all we can do is wait. </font>
story_83536_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I will send people to keep an eye on the East Chamber. You saved the emperor, were you rewarded? </font>
