DialogID_36653=I do not have medicine for internal injuries right now. Please help me pick some mountain herbs.
DialogID_36654=Haha, I know he loves to drink. Go give him this Thousand Storey Rice.
DialogID_36655=I just bought this beef haha. Do try it and please also give some to Zhang Yijin.
DialogID_36656=So it was Brother Bi who sent you here. That letter is important so I hid it in…
DialogID_36657=Recently there came a lot of Royal Guards, I was unable to pick my favorite Potherb to eat and was even beaten up by them…
DialogID_36658=I was beaten into unconsciousness, so I don't know anything. It was Wu Er who saved me, if you want to know more go ask her.
DialogID_36659=Me and Rong Er finished the job and returned here, and met some knife-wielding men who harassed us. Zi Lan was beaten into unconsciousness. Fortunately some constables passed by, otherwise...
DialogID_36660=I don't know what happened to Luo Er but she asked me to pick some Youth Grass for her. I am too busy to help her pick them!
DialogID_36661=Just spilled some medicine for Madam… I'm dead boohoo… they are expensive herbs. Go pick some Youth Grass for me.
DialogID_36662=Thank you, please send these two letters for me!
DialogID_36663=OK, thank you!
DialogID_36664=Thanks, if I have the chance I'll treat you to some wine!
DialogID_36665=Please help me pick some hay, but be careful of those wild boars and venomous snakes over there.
