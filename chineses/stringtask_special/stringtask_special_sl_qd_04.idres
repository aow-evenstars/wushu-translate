
dialogid_31834=Thank you. Now, could you please find the man who dropped this fan here? Remember to tell him I found it.
dialogid_31835=<s>Thank you so much. I know it's silly, but Erning and I were exchanging trinkets to signal our feelings for each other. I'd drop my fan, then she'd drop her harpin…but some other tea picker took it.
dialogid_31836=Thank you, but the boars are not the only pests in the tea forest! A group of armed men are making the girls very uncomfortable. Deal with them!
dialogid_31837=<s>Why would the Royal Guards collude with the Tea Forest? This is strange. I wonder if Dongfang Yuhuan is involved?
dialogid_31838=I know nothing about any relation between the Royal Guards and the Tea Forest.
dialogid_31839=Thank you for the flowers. Say, do you like riddles? Let me ask you one.
dialogid_31842=<s>One of those wolves bit me. I need a remedy made from the poison of a deadly animal. Can you help me?
dialogid_31843=<s>Yes, I am. We are chased by our enemies. There are many killers outside. I've hid myself for a long time. Please help me.
dialogid_31844=<s>Tell my sister not to worry about me. I'll go see her soon.
dialogid_31845=Some people were trying to kill me! I'll make them pay…
