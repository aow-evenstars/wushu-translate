They were all hit by The Unburied Master with a drug called Bewitching Drug, which can keep people unconscious for years. You quickly go to my house to pick a herb. This medicine is personally planted by me, named Grim Punisher, used to counter sedative drugs. </font>
story_74319_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Things have come to light. You should go to the Pill Refining Room to check it out, and return quickly. </font>
story_74320_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The Starry Pavilion disciples are able to look ageless because they take the Fairy Youth Retaining Pills all year round. Youth Retaining Pill not only makes you look ageless and fragrant, but also invulnerable to all kinds of toxins. </font>

story_74321_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >State your business.</font>
story_74322_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >It seems that the Youth Retaining Pills that the disciples have been taking recently have been quietly changed in composition. I have put the pills into water and they slowly oozed green. This green color is caused by gall and bile of the unique Snake King in Island of Eastern Ju. If you take it for a long time, you will be like a walking corpse and lose your mind. You have not had the opportunity to take Youth Retaining Pill, so you are not poisoned. </font>
story_74323_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Go quickly and inquire Zhong Yaoqin. </font>
story_74324_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I only tampered with the Youth Retaining Pills on Elder Cen's orders. </font>
story_74325_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >It seems that Cen Xianzhi had a large amount of Bewitching Drug in system, which made her lose mind. </font>
story_74326_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What happened? Ah, I've been tricked by The Unburied Master! I have always claimed to be a descendant of the Imperial Concubine with a distinguished status. I joined the Starry Pavilion because I wanted to rule the Eastern Seas. However, the Pavilion Leader has always been uncontested in all things, and the disciples are too comfortable and unmotivated. The Unburied Master's Kawada Reiko told me that there was an elixir formulated to increase human ambition, so I secretly instructed Yaoqin to change the ingredients of Youth Retaining Pill. Unexpectedly I harmed Starry Pavilion and caused a catastrophe...
story_74327_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Cen Xianzhi has taken Bewitching Drug, which has damaged his heart meridian and has only three years left to live. She has been punished, so let her spend the rest of her life in remorse. </font>

story_74328_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >This is a very good plan. Go to Zhong Yaoqin and ask her to lure Kawada Reiko to tell her that Starry Pavilion has been completely controlled by Cen Xianzhi and that The Unburied Master is going to invade it. </font>

story_74331_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I heard that Tenryu Secret Style has been attached to The Unburied Master for a long time, so you should go to Zuoteng Qianxin, the master of Tenryu Secret Style, to find out. </font>
story_74332_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We are once again working with Murong Qianqiu at the behest of The Unburied Master leader Kawada Matsuri. Kawada Matsuri is very ambitious. He wants to annex the Starry Pavilion and then use the power of Murong Family to invade Central Plains Wulin. </font>
story_74333_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >To cut the grass, we need to eliminate the root. These two Japanese sects have done nothing but evil. Heaven and earth will not tolerate this. This time the Starry Pavilion must do justice to Heaven. You must go and kill Kawada Matsuri and Zuoteng Qianxin at once. </font>
story_74334_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I heard that Pavilion Leader ordered you to kill Kawada Matsuri. I hope you'll leave him in my hands. Kawada Matsuri... I will never forget his voice. He was the one who killed and humiliated my father! </font>

story_74340_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Since you don't want to talk about it, just by looking at your martial skills, you must be from a famous school. I should not ask much too. Thank you! But I also have a request! </font>
story_74340_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I have an important secret letter in this package, entrusted by the Nangong Noble Household from Shu to the Starry Pavilion Leader Shenmang Princess Zhu Tang.
