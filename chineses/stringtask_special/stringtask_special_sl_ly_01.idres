
dialogid_38600=<s>Customer, are you going to have a meal or a lodging. We have a table for meals, but no room for lodging. Sorry.
dialogid_38601=<s>You came to join the tournament. We are busy, but I will tell the cook.
dialogid_38602=<s>I see you are a newcomer. This tournament in Luoyang will be held shortly.
dialogid_38603=I was wandering here for a while. Perhaps I left it in the Jewelry Shop.
dialogid_38604=Fourth Brother's disease? This is the medicine. Take it to him quickly!
dialogid_38605=You are getting this? Tell that girl she'd better be careful.
dialogid_38606=I found this umbrella ten years ago while looking for jewelry.
dialogid_38607=This umbrella is indeed mine. It was bought by father from the Western Regions. When I was little, my father went bankrupt. So he sold a lot of things, including this umbrella.
dialogid_38608=My business has done well these two years. So I opened this Jewelry Shop in Luo Yang. I never thought I could see this umbrella. I wanted to buy it but this lady also liked it. So i won't buy it.
dialogid_38609=What a stubborn man! By the way, what are you doing here?
dialogid_38610=Brother Pin, when shall we execute our plan? Hey, who are you? Did you hear anything?
dialogid_38611=This is Escort Leader Jin, who always rejects my suggestions. So boring.
dialogid_38612=That's it...Who are you? Why should I tell you? Go away.
dialogid_38613=You are so boring. Go away if you don't want to help.
dialogid_38614=Why did the Lead Escort Jin sent these blades? Anyway, let me have a look.
dialogid_38615=I don't care. Warn the waiter that my sister will destroy this place if he doesn't serve me!
dialogid_38616=My guest, what would you like?
dialogid_38617=Please tell her the meal will be served soon!
dialogid_38618=She found it? Oh...no...
dialogid_38619=You misunderstood me, this girl reminds me of my daughter.
dialogid_38620=But she looks like my lost daughter. So I kept looking at her just now. I want to recognize her.
dialogid_38621=Ao...
dialogid_38622=<s>Reviewing what you have learned and learning anew. You are fit to be a teacher.
dialogid_38623=Why is class still not over? So boring!
dialogid_38625=I tell you the building behind us is the well-known Tianxiang Pavilion. The owner of Tianxiang Pavilion admired experts in martial arts. So he set a new rule!
dialogid_38626=There are three roads leading inside. The left one is for the officials. The right one is for the merchants. The middle one, you need to pass by me.
dialogid_38627=Good Kung fu! Are you a disciple from some huge school?
dialogid_38628=Mr. Pei has a talent which cannot be imitated by others.
dialogid_38629=A La had studied more than ten yeas. Then he became a merchant after he realized the benefit of it. But now he is not as good as the brutes!
dialogid_38630=There are three hundred and sixty trades, and every trade has its master. In my opinion, without you those people would have starved to death.
dialogid_38631=That damned waiter is so stubborn. Tell him go away. I don't need his service.
dialogid_38632=Fine. I will wait here. If you have any demands, just call me.
dialogid_38633=I don't know how you got in. You should enjoy yourself in the Tianxiang Pavilion.
dialogid_38634=Yep, have you seen that big Monk? As a Monk, he can come to Tianxiang Pavilion. Why shouldn't we come?
dialogid_38635=I am just wandering.
dialogid_38636=I know what Miss is worring about. Every time Sir Zhao and Sir Su come to Tianxiang Pavilion. Our Miss will come too. Maybe she loves them.
dialogid_38637=Liang Er, don't utter any nonsense. I don't like those two guys. They are young but good at martial arts.
dialogid_38638=Miss is flushed red. You can tell this to Madame and let her propose for Miss. They will be very happy.
dialogid_38639=From civil and military matters, the state of the world, music, weiqi, calligraphy and painting, the opinion of Elder Brother Lu Lian and I are almost the same, we are like soulmates.
dialogid_38640=I've heard Miss Jingxiang seems to be fond of Brother Lu Lian.
dialogid_38641=Everything is Ok.
dialogid_38642=No problem.
dialogid_38643=Why doesn't brother Jia come to Green Bamboo Lane? I have something to give him. Can you help me find him?
dialogid_38644=Brother Jia? Do you mean Luo River Scholar Jia Siting?
dialogid_38645=I saw him leaving the City with Sir Jia? Perhaps he was going to handle a marrage proposal.
dialogid_38646=Talk with him it's not his business.
dialogid_38647=I hear it. He is so stubborn. How could he fish with such a big hook?
qiecuomenu_38600=Easy...Easy up.
qiecuotitle_38600=I am Wangtian Shui from Tangdao School. Be careful!
