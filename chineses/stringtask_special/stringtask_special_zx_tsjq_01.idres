story_74202_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Tianshan Sect was founded by Ye Qingtian. He had four students, including me and three others. We are also the elders for the Eastern, Southern, Western, and Northern Summits. Nowadays, the newly admitted disciples will have to choose one of the Southern and Northern Summits to join.</font>
story_74202_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The elder of the Southern Summit is Gu Baiyun. The elder of the Northern Summit is Zhuo Zhanxia. Most disciples in the Southern Summit are female. The Southern Summit earned a great reputation in wulin because they destroyed the bandits and fought against foreign enemies. As for the Northern Summit, Zhuo Zhanxia is known as the Best Swordsman. He encourages the disciples to learn the sword martial arts with a free spirit. There are many sword talents in the Northern Summit.</font>

story_74208_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >It must be the elder martial sister who blame it on your eyes. In the recent few years, she always use this excuse. Yet there are so many of us who saw the snow monster. The snow monster is indeed scary. It's huge and fast. I feel as if it can eat a man alive in one bite.</font>

The Dongfang family and my family have been friends for generations. Lingshao and I have known each other since childhood. Tianshan Sect and the Scholars also have a close connection. I would be happy to be their guide when they travel here, but I am currently occupied by many duties. Can you help me and show them the sceneries around Tianshan please?</font>

story_74215_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >It's pure luck. Let's go and have a look.</font>
story_74215_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >There are some Japanese texts on the roof of the snow cave. It says that a Tianshan female disciple and a Japanese man were sightseeing somewhere in Tianshan. The guy told the her that there is a box hidden in the snow forest, and asked her to take care of that box.</font>
story_74216_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >To find out who the female disciple is, we have to ask Elder Brother Chu first.</font>
story_74217_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I didn't expect that you would find out about it. It's not something that you should mention randomly. You'd better not ask about that female disciple.</font>
story_74218_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Since Brother Chu doesn't want to talk about this issue, we should not force him. Let's go to the library, and see if we can find any clue there.</font>
story_74219_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The letter records that a male disciple from Tenryu Secret Style and a female disciple from Tianshan Sect had some afterthoughts about their duel. They often duel on the highest summit in Tianshan.</font>
story_74220_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >There used to be a famous Ice Fairy in Tianshan Sect. Her name is Bai Nuoli. She is my elder martial sister. She is also the headmaster's niece and favorite disciple. Seven years ago, when the young master of Tenryu Secret Style Kiyokawa Yoshiteru visit Tianshan, the headmaster sent her to show him the Tianshan scenaries and discuss about martial arts of both sects.</font>
story_74221_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Well...</font>
story_74221_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We are samurais sent by the Elder Badao of Tenryu Secret Style. In the recent few years, we have been disguised as the snow monster and trying to search for the young master. Years ago, we were ordered to kill the young master, but the Ice Fairy rescued him. Then they both jumped off the cliff. Yet we didn't find their corpses at the bottom of the cliff. We didn't finish our mission and had to stay here and search further. In the past seven years, we couldn't find their traces.</font>
story_74222_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Since the Japanese didn't find their corpses, they must still be alive. They probably had some random encounters. We shall go and have a check in the mountain.</font>
story_74223_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Back then we were poisoned by the poisons on their weapons. We jumped off the cliff and happened to land in the cave. But we couldn't find the exit in the past seven years. Also, we have been poisoned, so we have been trapped here.</font>
story_74224_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Tianshan Snow Lotus can heal this poison. Since they have been poisoned for seven years, they will need seven Tianshan Snow Lotuses. I have six. Please help to find one more.</font>

story_74226_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I didn't expect that you could solve the case from many years ago. You did a good job and shall be rewarded. The Southern Summit Elder and the Northern Summit Elder agreed to let you become the first disciple of Tianshan to join both summits.</font>
story_74227_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You did an excellent job! The two elders have told the headmaster about it. The headmaster wants to meet you.</font>
story_74228_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Now matter what you saw just now, please trust me. I won't do anything to harm Tianshan Sect.</font>
story_74229_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I have always heard that Miss Zhang is an exceptional person with mysterious origins. I think she has other untold intentions. Please keep an eye on her, in case she does anything to harm Tianshan Sect.</font>
story_74230_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The brother is not a bad guy. I cried earlier because I could not find my elder sister. The brother accompanied me, and even bought a candy for me.</font>
story_74231_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We would not become friends if there was no such misunderstanding. I will not take that as a grudge.</font>
story_74231_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You are really nice to step up for an unknown child. My name is Kai Yifeng. We are friends now. I got an invitation from the alliance leader. And I am on my way to participate in the New Star Competition.</font>
story_74232_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >There is still time before the competition. Let's sneak into the alliance leader's manor. If his daughter is pretty, that's great. Otherwise, we should not bother to participate in the competition.</font>
story_74233_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Miss Lin? Our alliance leader does not have a daughter!</font>
story_74234_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Gather at the Martial Arts School. When people are ready, we can start the competition.</font>
story_74235_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The New Star Competition is ready. You just have to go to the Martial Arts School and find the judge.</font>
story_74236_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >In fact, the competition is just a guise. We have other important tasks for you young heroes. My daughter in law Yunlai went missing a while ago. I sent many people to search for her and got no results. Instead, we found many suspicious traces in Yanyu Villa and Suzhou.</font>
story_74236_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The identity of my daughter is special. We have to trace back to the Myanmar Dynasty. There are six Tribe Chiefs. A month ago, three of them got killed together with their families. Luckily, Princess Yunlai came to Jiangnan a year ago. I taught her martial arts, and took her in as my righteous daughter. A few days ago, bad news from Myanmar came. She was shocked and went missing. I sent people to search for her. The only thing I am sure is that she is still in Jiangnan. Please help to find her. Furthermore, some foreign wulin evil factions plan to assassinate the princess. The most urgent thing to do now is to find the princess.</font>
story_74237_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We have been working together all the way. Let's team up to search for the princess. The Salt Gang knows the ways by boat well. Go to their leader Liu Tai, and see if he knows anything.</font>
story_74238_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Many people travel in boat everyday recently. There aren't any suspicious people.</font>
story_74239_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >No, you are wrong! I am not Princess Yunlai. I am her maid, Yao Er. We were kidnapped by the men in black, but we lost each other... Sob sob sob...</font>
story_74241_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What's urgent now is that you go and inform the alliance leader about the Salt Gang's deeds. I will remain here and investigate some more.</font>
story_74242_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Based on the secret report just now, Tianwaitian and the foreign wulin has been in an ally for a long time. They plan to secretly meet around the area of Tai Lake underground palace in Suzhou. To know the whereabouts of the princess, you will have to go and investigate.</font>
story_74243_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The jade pendant is given to you by Kai? Who is he... Take me to meet him now.</font>
story_74245_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I wasn't full dead back then. Meng Sha didn't really fulfill his promise to bury the dead people in the general's family. Instead, Jiugong Elder saved me and took me back to Jiangnan... I don't really want to bring up those old memories. I still have one question for my elder sister. Why did she leave the alliance leader's manor the other day? And how did she get trapped in the Tai Lake underground palace? I don't feel well right now. Please help me to ask her.</font>
story_74246_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Tianwaitian and foreign wulin have always been waiting for their opportunity. After they heard the issue in Myanmar, they wanted me to go back and become the new Tribe Chief. Then they can use the army in Myanmar to invade central wulin. It's nothing trivial. Please report to my righteous father about this issue. My younger brother and I just reunited, and he is badly injured. We plan to rest here in Wind Bell Valley for a few days first.</font>
story_74247_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You are indeed exceptional. It took you only a short while to find Yunlai. But where is she?</font>
story_74247_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >That's really unexpected... I have a favor to ask you. There is a foreign wulin mysterious spy lurking in Suzhou recently. Go and capture him.</font>
story_74249_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >A Swordsman from central plain... Exceptional sword skills... This reminds me of one person. You should visit the Jiugong Elder, and ask about Kai Yifeng's origin.</font>
story_74251_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thank you. Both Yunlai and her brother are back. You should go and have a duel with Kai Yifeng. I'd like to know which one of you two is better at martial arts.</font>
story_74252_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >To report to the Imperial Court and to reveal the evil plan, we must first find the evidence that the foreign wulin and Tianwaitian are allied. To do this, I will need your help.</font>
story_74253_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You are indeed good. After the series of issues, Yunlai couldn't be happy at all. You saved her life. And she values you as a close friend. I'd like to ask you to cheer her up.</font>
story_74254_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Since Kai Yifeng told me about his past, he didn't come to meet me even once.</font>
story_74255_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > There are no wars in the boundary area. The Imperial Court also has promoted three new Tribe Chiefs. The evil deeds of Tianwaitian and foreign wulin got exposed, and they both ran away. That puts an end to everything. I really appreciate your good deeds, and will teach you some martial arts.</font>
story_74291_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We received information from Wudang a few days ago, saying that there were frequent abnormal activities in Tiger Roaring Villa, and we hope each School is keeping an eye on this.</font>
story_74291_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The issue this time is not trivial. Sage Ziyang of Wudang sent a message that there are people from Xixia First Class Hall currently in Tiger Roaring Villa. Go to the Tiger Roaring Villa, and investigate the issue!</font>
story_74292_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Zhao Ziji was badly injured, so we thought he must be dead. For so many years, there was not any news about him. I didn't expect to hear that he appears again in Suzhou. Go to Suzhou and collect information.</font>
story_74293_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Zhao Ziji? What a coincidence. A couple of days ago, many men came here looking for Zhao Ziji. Is he the one you're talking about? </font>
story_74293_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Zhao Ziji has been living in Twilight Village. If all those who want revenge on him go there, there will be great unrest.</font>
story_74294_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >If this is true, then Zhao Ziji must be the person from the past. But since Han Family is there, it is hard for us Tianshan to kill our enemy.</font>
story_74294_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Quickly go to the Twilight Village. We must kill Tianshan Sect's enemy with our own hands. I will reward well whoever kills Zhao Ziji.</font>
story_74296_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Since Elder Wang said so, the mysterious pill must be very important. However, to keep it only to Tianshan Sect probably is not an easy task.</font>
story_74296_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Go to the Green Cloud Castle now, and find out who took the mysterious pill. Regardless of your plan, make sure to bring the mysterious pill back.</font>
