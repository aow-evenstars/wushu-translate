questioninfo_34600=Answer <a href="findnpc_new,born01,WorldNpc10962" style="HLStype1">Tu Xing</a>'s question.
story_34601_1=As the saying goes : "Changan is filled with mums. Their aroma is strong." During the late Tang, famine occurred in some farming areas. Every farmer lived off eating grass, roots and leaves but the government still levied taxes.
story_34601_2=Our government is doing the same thing while the land near the Yellow River is swarming with suffering people. They'll never see my sorrow!
story_34603_1=There once lived a glorious martial arts family blessed with extraordinary kung fu. However, one of its members, Zhou Shiming, in an effort to cover up an unexplained disability, created something utterly horrifying...
story_34605_1=There are many trials here that you cannot overcome with strength alone. The only thing our experts can agree upon is the utter importance of courtesy.
story_34605_2=Every now and then, retreating is the better option.
story_34606_1=Of course you are! When you have a reputation like mine, everyone will be in awe of you. Of course, it is not something you can get overnight. It requires lots of time and energy.
story_34606_2=Remember, nothing is impossible as long as you keep trying.
story_34607_2=One year, during the wine tasting ceremony, the owner asked two waiters to deliver the wine from his workshop. He never expected his waiter would get thirsty and drink half the jar!
story_34607_3=Realzing his own stupidity, the waiter panicked and searched frantically for a solution. He then spotted a clear spring in a nearby bamboo forest. Desperate, he mixed some water from the spring with what was left of the wine and entered the contest. The last thing he expected was for the wine to win first place! Feeling guilty, he told his boss the truth. His boss then built a wine lane next to that very bamboo forest. His wine is now famous all over the parts of the world that matter!
story_34609_1=Let me have a drink before I tell you the details.
story_34609_2=(Speechless temporally) There was no moonlight that night; It was ghastly when I stepped out of the house. I didn't care too much about it and drank some wine to embolden myself and got ready to enter the tomb. However, I didn't expect that a gust of chilly wind blew in the hermetic tomb. I almost regained consciousness from drunk suddenly. I noticed that the tomb was very big and thought that there must be many treasures in it.
story_34609_3=I am very careful when I go down there. Earlier I heard a harsh-sounding whisper coming from a coffin? I immediate ran for my life. As soon as I reached the exit, I heard a thud which sounded like the lid of the coffin falling to the ground. I didn't stay there any longer than I had to, let me tell ya.
story_34610_1=Tomb burglars often come here. I'm just a grave keeper with simple skills, how could I catch those highly skilled notorious bandit leaders?
story_34610_2=Not soon after he went away, there were two people with strange clothes who did not look like they came from the Central Plains. They took a corpse from the mausoleum. I was so frightened I hid myself. Not only were they unafraid of the corpse, it was re-animated as a zombie to do their bidding! As soon as I saw that I just ran for my life.
story_34611_1=Lots of strangers came by a few days ago. I've been here for quite a while and I've never seen so much activity in the town. Anyway, it's good for business!
