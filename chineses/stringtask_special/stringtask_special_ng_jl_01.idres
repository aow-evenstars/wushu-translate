
SubmitNpcEx_58001=An Legong told us that he wounded the thief. We should be able to find his hidden place. Report back to the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4neidh_jlg" style="HLStype1">Elder Manager </a>and ask for his decision.
SubmitNpcEx_58002=The blood stains have been removed by the Disciples of the Blade Sharpening Hall. It doesn't make sense if we continue to look for them. Report back to the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4neidh_jlg" style="HLStype1">Elder Manager </a>and then we'll think about what to do next.
SubmitNpcEx_58003=Who is the Blade Sharpening Hall? They dared to killed people silently in Wanderer's Valley. Those Disciples who knew what happened were all killed. Report back to the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4neidh_jlg" style="HLStype1">Elder Manager </a>right away.
SubmitNpcEx_58004=The skin of this corpse has turned green; this might have been caused by powerful poison. I speculate that it was a trap set up by the Blade Sharpening Hall to attack those who are conducting an investigation. Since the Blade Sharpening Hall has already found out, it won't make sense to continue the investigation. Go back to report to the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4neidh_jlg" style="HLStype1">Elder Manager.</a>
SubmitNpcEx_58005=Now we guess that the Jade Ornament thief was possible a person from Wanderer's Valley, and he was wounded by An Legong. Report this to the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4neidh_jlg" style="HLStype1">Elder Manager</a>.
SubmitNpcEx_58012=The Mysterious Person's corpse is gone! Could he play dead on us? Can it be that the note wants us to investigate who this is Mysterious Person is? Hurry back and report this to the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4neidh_jlg" style="HLStype1">Elder Manager</a>.
SubmitNpcEx_58013=It seems that thief is called Wuma Guijun, and was Lan Xuexin's lover. But it seems Wuma Guijun did Lan Xuexin wrong and was killed by Lan Xuexin. We don't whether Wuma Guijun is dead or alive. The identity of the Mysterious Person is still a puzzle. Go back and report to the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4neidh_jlg" style="HLStype1">Elder Manager </a>and we'll think of something.
SubmitNpcEx_58014=So, Wuma Guijun did Lan Xuexin wrong, and she smothered him to death at night and then ate his corpse. But, how can Wuma Guijun come back to life? And what's his connection with the Blade Sharpening Hall? Put down the questions and go back to report to the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4neidh_jlg" style="HLStype1">Elder Manager</a>.
SubmitNpcEx_58016=The note states: "Young Hall Leader is indeed a good judge of people, so the final selection will be between you two--the Blade Sharpening Hall." It looks like all was set up by the Blade Sharpening Hall. Go back and report to the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4neidh_jlg" style="HLStype1">Elder Manager</a>.
SubmitNpcEx_58017=So it was the Blade Sharpening Hall that tricked Lan Xuexin into making an attempt on Wuma Guijun's life, thus winning Wuma Guijun to their side. They then used him to steal the Jade Ornament. Go back to report to the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4neidh_jlg" style="HLStype1">Elder Manager </a>right away.
SubmitNpcEx_58042=In order to rescue the Four Great Outlaws, go to <a href="findnpc_new,city03,EventNPCxszhh_4nei_fgxsh" style="HLStype1">Mirror Lake </a>in Jinling. Find <a href="findnpc_new,city03,NPCxszhh_4nei_yuming" style="HLStype1">Yu Weitian </a>and try to find out the details.
collectinfo_83011=There is a <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_g02" style="HLStype1">note </a>. It might have been left by the mute servant.
collectinfo_83012=That <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_g01" style="HLStype1">hidden weapon </a>comes with a note. Take a look.
collectinfo_83021=There is no trace of Lan Xuexin and Wuma Guijun. We did find a <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_g03" style="HLStype1">note </a>not far away. Let's take a look at it.
hunterinfo_83001=The blood stains have been removed by someone. Defeat the remaining <a href="findnpc,school04,-96.521,108.898,-172.977" style="HLStype1">Blade Sharpening Hall disciples </a>and then go back to report.
hunterinfo_83011=That person looks like he is from Wanderer's Valley, and is wounded.... Wasn't he the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_04" style="HLStype1">Mysterious Person </a>who stole the Jade Ornament and was injured by An Legong? Defeat him and reclaim the Jade Ornament.
hunterinfo_83012=Why is Lan Xuexin attacking An Legong? Stop <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_01" style="HLStype1">Lan Xuexin </a>immediately.
hunterinfo_83021=Why is Lan Xuexin also here? Take care not to allow her to delay the capture of <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_06" style="HLStype1">Wuma Guijun</a>.
hunterinfo_83031=Defeat <a href="findnpc,born02,-385.076,42.046,752.907" style="HLStype1">Wuma Guijun </a>and reclaim the stolen Jade Ornament.
hunterinfo_83032=They are in our way! Hurry and defeat the <a href="findnpc,born02,-48.236,-0.021,484.812" style="HLStype1">Blade Sharpening Hall Disciples.</a>
hunterinfo_83033=There are <a href="findnpc,born02,194.701,5.698,326.248" style="HLStype1">Blade Sharpening Hall Disciples </a>ahead of us. Defeat them and clear the way.
hunterinfo_83034=So, the mute servant went up to the mountain through that <a href="findnpc_new,born02,PlotDoor00035" style="HLStype1">junction</a>. The person not far ahead of us is the <a href="findnpc,adv101,740.485,140.203,18.076" style="HLStype1">Young Hall Leader </a>of the Blade Sharpening Hall. Defeat him and reclaim the Jade Ornament!
hunterinfo_83041=Take down Blood-drinking Blacksmith <a href="findnpc_new,born03,PlotDoor00053" style="HLStype1">Xue Jianjian</a>, who is hiding in a <a href="findnpc_new,adv106,-66.379,66.356,-202.855" style="HLStype1">valley </a>near the Yanyu Villa. This will weaken the Blade Sharpening Hall.
interactinfo_83001=The thief was injured by An Legong and escaped from the eaves. Some <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_blood1" style="HLStype1">blood stains</a> must have been left behind, go and check them out.
interactinfo_83002=My guess is right. There was a trail of <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_blood2" style="HLStype1">blood stains </a>not far away. The thief must have run toward that direction. But it looks like something is going on there; go up and check it.
interactinfo_83003=The Elder Manager said that there were some Disciples doing Patrol in Qingtian Temple. Go to Qingtian Temple and find Patrol Disciple <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_st1" style="HLStype1">Sang Zhengwu</a>. Ask him if he has seen anything.
interactinfo_83004=Patrol Disciple Sang Zhengwu has already been murdered. It must be that the Blade Sharpening Hall had known, and wanted to kill anyone who knows. Go and find the other Patrol Disciple before the Blade Sharpening Hall finds him, his name is <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_st2" style="HLStype1">Yu Jianxin.</a>
interactinfo_83005=Patrol Disciple {@IDName:npc_4nei_jlg_st2} is also dead What's the background of the Blade Sharpening Hall? Go and find the last Patrol Disciple <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_st3" style="HLStype1">{@IDName:npc_4nei_jlg_st3}</a>, or he will be killed too.
interactinfo_83006=The thief's blood stains were removed, and the witnesses were also killed. The mute servant was wounded by the Valley Leader. I can still track his <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_blood3" style="HLStype1">blood stains</a>.
interactinfo_83007=ha ha, the Blade Sharpening Hall finally missed something. The blood stains haven't been removed here. Continue to investigate the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_blood4" style="HLStype1">blood stains </a>and find that mute servant.
interactinfo_83008=It looks like there is another trail of <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_blood5" style="HLStype1">blood stains </a>ahead of us. I don't see anything, but it feels strange. Better be careful.
interactinfo_83009=There is a <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_st4" style="HLStype1">corpse </a>ahead. Watch out and check it.
interactinfo_83011=There's no progress in solving the riddle. Should I follow the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_evt1" style="HLStype1">mute servant's escape route </a>and see if I can find some clues.
interactinfo_83012=It says "Behind the Great Hall" on the note. Can it be <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_evt2" style="HLStype1">there</a>?
interactinfo_83013=I got nothing after discussing with the Elder Manager. Go to the place where the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_evt3" style="HLStype1">Mysterious Person's corpse </a>was found and see if I missed some clues.
interactinfo_83014=Go and ask <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_evt4" style="HLStype1">An Legong </a>if he has any clues about the thief.
interactinfo_83021=Follow the Elder Manager's order and go to <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_evt5" style="HLStype1">Tianyou Temple </a>to arrest Wuma Guijun and take back the Jade Ornament.
interactinfo_83022=The Valley Leader has send people to help. Go to <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_evt6" style="HLStype1">Tianyou Temple </a>immediately to prevent Wuma Guijun from running away.
interactinfo_83023=What's the intention of the Blade Sharpening Hall in leaving a note? <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_evt7" style="HLStype1">Walk around </a>and think how to solve the riddles left by the Blade Sharpening Hall.
interactinfo_83024=Wuma Guijun must have stolen the Jade Ornament under the order of the Blade Sharpening Hall. But, what's his intention? Does it have anything to do with the final selection? Could it the Blade Sharpening Hall is blackmailing Wuma Guijun? I have a hunch that it has something to do with Lan Xuexin. <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_evt8" style="HLStype1">Go around more </a>and try to find some inspiration.
interactinfo_83025=By the way, didn't Lan Xuexin say he would smother Wuma Guijun to death at night and then eat him. Something like that. Smother him to death. The face can't even be identified. He had to be out of his mind to do something crazy like eating people. So, this means that Lan Xuexin killed another person and it was connected with the Blade Sharpening Hall. <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4nei_jlg_evt9" style="HLStype1">Go look around</a>, we are about to find out something.
interactinfo_83031=According to our intelligence, the whereabouts of Wuma Guijun, Lan Xuexin and mute servant is already known. Hurry and go to <a href="findnpc_new,born02,npc_4nei_jlg_evt10" style="HLStype1">Suyun Palace </a>of in the Ruined Valley, and take back the stolen Jade Ornament.
interactinfo_83032=Wuma Guijun has been defeated, but he doesn't have the Jade Ornament. People have rushed over from Wanderer's Valley and are fighting against the Blade Sharpening Hall. "You are selected when you see this word. Follow my servant and take your treasure." Follow the instructions on the note and follow the <a href="findnpc_new,born02,npc_4nei_jlg_evt11" style="HLStype1">mute servant.</a>
interactinfo_83033=The Blade Sharpening Hall went through so much trouble to steal the treasure from Wanderer's Valley. What's their intention? Did they display such power just for the fun of it? Put down your questions and follow the <a href="findnpc_new,born02,npc_4nei_jlg_evt12" style="HLStype1">mute servant.</a>
interactinfo_83034=Clean away obstructions and continue to <a href="findnpc_new,born02,npc_4nei_jlg_evt13" style="HLStype1">move forward</a>. What's the purpose of this trip by the Blade Sharpening Hall? It seems like the Blade Sharpening Hall also did this to the other seven Schools. Such a great scale, their true power can't be ignored.
interactinfo_83035=That's right. After the battle, the Disciples from Wanderer's Valley got something out of it. It's indeed more important to have a real battle that can arouse Hidden Energy. Continue to follow the <a href="findnpc_new,born02,npc_4nei_jlg_evt14" style="HLStype1">mute servant.</a>
interactinfo_83036=I'm getting closer and closer. The final truth is waiting for us. Follow the <a href="findnpc_new,born02,npc_4nei_jlg_evt15" style="HLStype1">mute servant</a>, and hurry.

storyinfo_83002=The Valley Leader wants you to investigate the Blade Sharpening Hall's background in secret. Go to Qingtian Temple and ask <a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03875" style="HLStype1">An Legong </a>first, and see if you can find any clues about the person who stole the Jade Ornament.
storyinfo_83003=The Blade Sharpening Hall has cut off all the clues. Hurry and report to <a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03816" style="HLStype1">Shan Tianming</a>. Maybe the Blade Sharpening Hall is not an easy opponent to deal with.
storyinfo_83011=Listen <a href="findnpc_new,," style="HLStype1"></a>to the explanation.
storyinfo_83012="Who am I?" is written on the note. Consult with the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_4neidh_jlg" style="HLStype1">Elder Manager</a>. Maybe this is the first riddle.
storyinfo_83013=Lan Xuexin is still unconscious and can't be questioned. Go and find Shi Shi <a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03810" style="HLStype1">Yaojian </a>and ask him about the dispute between Wuma Guijun and Lan Xuexin.

storyinfo_83033=Wanderer's Valley and the Blade Sharpening Hall had a major confrontation.

storymenu_83003_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >It's impossible that the mute servant showed up in front of the Valley Leader without any injury after he was wounded by An Legong earlier.

Not to mention that another School might think Wanderer's Valley has submitted to the Imperial Court. So, I decided to rescue them myself.</font>

DialogID_83050=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Have you ever heard of the He's Jade? The reunion of He's Jade depends entirely on an important figure named Master Yu.

Days ago, we received an order to release some prisoners and were told to keep our weapons sheathed no matter how bad the situation may get. Then we saw several men with their faces shrouded chasing a criminal to the direction of Dounan Villa. </font>

SubmitNpcEx_58055=Talk to <a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03816" style="HLStype1">Shan Tianming</a>.
collectinfo_83022=How dare a <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_5nei_jlg_001" style="HLStype1">minion of the Tianyi Cult</a> come here! Kill him and see what he has on him!
hunterinfo_83042=There's usually not this many guards. Something is not right about <a href="findnpc_new,school04,monm040702" style="HLStype1">these</a> people's appearance. Perhaps they are pretending to be members of Tianyi Cult?
hunterinfo_83043=So it is a fake. Then where is the person behind this? For now I will keep killing these <a href="findnpc_new,school04,monm040704" style="HLStype1">Wandering Soul Cave Elites</a>.
interactinfo_83050=<a href="findnpc_new,school04,JlgNpc032" style="HLStype1">Xiahou Chi</a> seems to want to talk to me.
interactinfo_83051=Ask the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03828" style="HLStype1">Wanderer's Valley Guard</a> if there is any trace of the Tianyi Cult.
interactinfo_83052=Something is wrong in the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,Event_5nei_jlg_83051" style="HLStype1">Wandering Soul Cave</a>? Wanderer's Valley has always kept its prisoners there. The guards are well equipped so I don't see how there could be a problem.
interactinfo_83053=Ask <a href="findnpc_new,school04,JlgNpc002" style="HLStype1">Dang Ying</a> for directions.

interactinfo_83059=Based on what Yin Feng  said, those people were heading toward <a href="findnpc_new,school04,Event_5nei_jlg_83059" style="HLStype1">Wuji Valley</a>.
interactinfo_83060=Look for traces of a fight, such as <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_5nei_jlg_003" style="HLStype1">Blood Drops</a>.
interactinfo_83061=Just one drop of blood is not be very helpful. Search <a href="findnpc_new,school04,npc_5nei_jlg_004" style="HLStype1">again</a>.
interactinfo_83062=The blood stains lead toward the <a href="findnpc_new,school04,Event_5nei_jlg_83062" style="HLStype1">Huixian Posthouse</a>.
interactinfo_83063=You overhear the sound of <a href="findnpc_new,school04,Event_5nei_jlg_83063" style="HLStype1">fighting</a>. Head there immediately.
interactinfo_83064=Before <a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03816" style="HLStype1">Leader Shan</a> left, he was hinting I should visit him later. I'll do that now.
