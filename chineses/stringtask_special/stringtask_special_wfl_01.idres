story_87_5=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Listen to me. I have recently learned the value of "drawing" the knife. Drawing is different from wiping, which is fast, while drawing is slow. Wiping is also different from sliding, which is shallow, while drawing is deep. </font>
story_87_6=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >When drawing the knife, only use 70% of your strength. Hold it firmly and first and then lightly. Start slow and then get faster. When you are using this skill, you mind must be at peace. </font>
