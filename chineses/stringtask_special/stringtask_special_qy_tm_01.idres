It's said that this person grew up in the Beggar's Sect. He possesses great Kung Fu skill and is a quick learner. He invented a new Kung Fu skill when he was just a young man. But even a Hero couldn't escape from a matter of heart. The woman he loved left him and married a great scholar's son. Heartbroken, he left and roamed all over the world. It's rumored that he has showed up at Snowy Mountain. Ah, the Beggar's Sect wouldn’t be in such a situation if he were still around. Why are you asking after this person? Do you know this person?</font>
