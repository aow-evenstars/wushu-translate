
DialogID_52800=Those robber subordinates are too arrogant. We must punish them harshly so they don't dare come back.
DialogID_52801=I found out 500 Liang is missing when I was going over the account book. They must've stole it. Help me take it back.
DialogID_52802=What are you doing here?
DialogID_52803=I see. But Yongle Temple hasn't been peaceful either. Some criminals are here causing trouble and we have no men to spare.
DialogID_52804=Amitabha, check to see if they are carrying something that can identify them. Someone must be giving them orders for something big like this.
DialogID_52805=I was injured by those Yongle Temple Evil Monks. Please help me drive them away.
DialogID_52806=A couple of days ago a Yongle Temple Martial Monk stole the Ninth Return Pill from the temple. I hope you can help me get it back.
DialogID_52807=What are you doing here?
DialogID_52808=I already found some suspicious people on the cliff. Can you help me investigate?
DialogID_52809=How is Ji Zhanfa doing?
DialogID_52810=I see. The monk I sent to investigate told me there are a lot of thugs gathering near the Liuxiang Ravine. Go defeat them and protect Ji Zhanfa.
DialogID_52811=I am poisoned. Only the Liuxiang Ravine Poison Using Man has the antidote. Help me get it.
DialogID_52812=What do you need?
DialogID_52813=I see. Someone dares to bully my sister? Go tell her I will visit her within three days. Help me give this letter to her.
DialogID_52814=What did my brother say?
DialogID_52815=The Evil Merchants always rob the nearby businessmen. Go drive them off.
DialogID_52816=They act together so they must have a leader. Help me investigate.
DialogID_52817=Great. But other than the Forest Ambusher there are still a group of Ambushing Scouts. Help me take care of them.
DialogID_52818=Go talk to Yongle Temple's Master Xuanbei. Tell him to come uphold justice.
DialogID_52819=Looks like Mr. Mei is in trouble. I will take care of it. Please tell him not to worry.
DialogID_52820=My friend Huang Ting went to the Fascinating Place for many days and I want to know how she is doing. Help me check on her.
DialogID_52821=I'm in trouble. Come help me if you are not busy.
DialogID_52822=It's not safe here anymore. There are some Fascinating Place defenders over there. Help me drive them away.
DialogID_52823=What do you need?
DialogID_52824=How can she be so careless away from home? Here! This is Wound Healing Drug.
DialogID_52825=What do you think of my answer?
DialogID_52826=So not only Hidden Experts came, but also Hidden Supremers. Help me drive them away.
