They were once forced to hide in Evil Men's Valley for various reasons and have strange preferences.

story_17007_1=<s>Oh? What happened?
story_17007_2=Then you helped Sky Fragrance Teahouse rescue Qin Xiuxiu. As a result, people suspected that you conspired with Evil Men's Valley and Royal Guards to save Qin Xiuxiu safely?
story_17008_1=You don't look like a bad person. You had better break away from Royal Guards and the Imperial Court.
story_17009_1=You asked brothers of Beggar's Sect and me to enter through the main gate, but we found no one in Holy Wind Gang and suspected some trick. Then we were surrounded by Royal Guards and disciples of Holy Wind Gang when we just wanted to withdraw. Finally only a few brothers and I escaped death. So why could they set an ambush early if you weren't a flunky of Royal Guards?
story_17010_1=<s>Most of the salt markets are contolled by our Salt Gang. Only the force of Seven-star Pond drove away all our salt shops and didn't allow us to develop there. Damn it!

story_17013_1=It's about Shaoxia's story. It's rumored that Shaoxia is an offspring of an official of previous dynasty. Unfortunately, Zhu Yuanzhang suspected almost everyone and framed up your father with a fabricated charge. As a result, dozens of family members are killed.
story_17013_2=You're the only offspring, so your mother commissioned a servant to look after and escape with you. However, the army discovered it and kept chasing you. They found that servant in the suburbs of Chengdu but didn't spot you. Perhaps the servant thought it difficult to run away together, so he abandoned it on the way rather than got arrested by them.
story_17014_1=<s>You do not look like a typical Royal Guard.
story_17014_2=Helmsman of Beggar's Sect finally returned that secret script, stating that a warrior helped them get it back. I guess it's you.
story_17015_1=It was Five-immortal Sec who asked us to come to Yanjing. They used lots of treasure and jewelry to allure our Devil's Gate to help them. We don't know what to do. They just let us wait for their messages in Yanjing.

story_17020_1=Five-immortal Sect? I saw some disciples of Five-immortal Sect gather in Yanjing City when I just arrived. Did they come to Yanjing for a person in Nishang Palace?

story_17023_1=Martial artists must train through the hottest and coldest days to perfect their skills.
story_17023_2=Right, the kung fu moves may vary but generally are divided into three categories: feint, overt and block. Overt moves refer to special feint ones that handle the complicated moves with simple ones to subdue your rivals. Feint moves refer to special block moves launched when facing your enemies to respond to the other party. Block moves refer to special overt moves that leave somebody at large in order to apprehend him afterwards to resist the other party.
story_17024_1=<s>Train your muscles outside; train your mind inside. However, if you want to accomplish great things in the martial arts, you must never neglect the training of your internal skills.

story_17046_1=W-what? How could you tell? Is my skin pale?
story_17046_2=<s><font face="Default" color="#8fd6ef" >(Sigh)</font>Yes, I was poisoned. On my last trip to Luoyang I was poisoned by the Five Immortal Sect after I saw them robbing a caravan.
story_17046_3=No! They told me if I implicated Rat Gate in the robbery, they would give me the antidote. But they lied!
story_17047_1=<s>Don't mind my father, he’s just jealous. Two vicious groups hunting you at your age? It was years before anyone hated him that much.
story_17047_2=<s>-Oh don't be so modest! You'll like it here. Everyone deserves a second chance, right?
story_17048_1=<s>It's about time you showed up. I was beginning to fear my act under the bridge wasn't convincing.
story_17048_2=Just someone who could solve your Sky Star Gang problems. But first I need Clear Jade Grass from nearby to treat my injuries.
story_17049_1=<s>Yes, but I know a pill that will let you fake your death. To make it, I need the gall bladder of a giant snake.
story_17050_1=<s>It's strange, the Rat Gate has never done anything like this before. This isn't like them.
story_17050_2=<s>I've assigned our top undercover agent Nalan Qing'er to the investigation. Find her and see what she has to say.
story_17051_1=<s>Why did you want to meet our leader?
story_17052_1=<s>Why is my Favorite Blade in your hand? Did you steal it?
story_17053_1=<s>Diao Man is usually excited when she visits Luoyang. However, she was very quiet on that day the caravan was robbed.
story_17054_1=<s>What? Who would do such a thing?
story_17054_2=We’ll never be able to live free as long as they are around. But at least we can cure Diao Man’s poisoning for now.
story_17055_1=<s>Jin Zhuni was trying to expand Five Immortal Sect power. She needed money and resources without drawing attention to herself.

story_17056_1=<s>Silence! You know Shen family secret techniques. Give me the script!

story_menu_17009=What  on Earth happened?
story_menu_17010=Why did conflicts happen?

story_menu_17014=Then Royal Guards hated and framed up me as a contact inside Royal Guards
story_menu_17015=Well, I learnt that many people from Devil's Gate have arrived in Yanjing. What's wrong?
story_menu_17016=I intended to go to the site of Royal Guards. But I met people from Weiyuan Escort Agency on the way and then helped them chase that lech.
story_menu_17019=Speak it out, girl. Perhaps I can help you.
story_menu_17020=I have met people from Nishang Palace recently. I also have to help them deal with disciples from Five-immortal Sect and Devil's Gate.

story_menu_17043=What is your experience since last departure, girl?
story_menu_17044=I don't suppose you could offer any help now?

storymenu_17006_2=Everyone has suspected that I went undercover for Royal Guards, no matter how I tried to explain it. Thus I had to find alliance leader Lin to demonstrate my innocence.
storymenu_17006_3=Evil Men's Valley captured persons from Sky Fragrance Teahouse and then Royal Guards got them from Evil Men's Valley. I just saved them
storymenu_17007_1=Qin Xiuxiu from Sky Fragrance Teahouse was kidnapped by Ruined Valley and then captured by Royal Guards.
storymenu_17007_2=You're right, master. That's the case.
storymenu_17008_1=I see. Elder, you are also mistaken about me. It's hard for me to wash myself clean.
storymenu_17009_1=It's not me. Something is wrong and I have to go back and find Elder Xiang.
storymenu_17010_1=What's your plan? I believe your sect must have found countermeasures.
storymenu_17011_1=I've been dealing with the Royal Guards and the Salt Gang. It's a trap.
storymenu_17011_2=Originally, I was a junior clerk at a teahouse in Chengdu, but I somehow fell into a life of crime.
storymenu_17012_1=What a wise Pond Leader! As the saying goes, mantis stalks a cicada but forgets the coming disaster from golden oriole.
storymenu_17013_1=How could I survive? (with tears in the eyes)
storymenu_17013_2=So that's the case...My heart is a real mess...Why?
storymenu_17014_1=Then at the Scholars, I was again framed up as a contact of Royal Guards to steal their secret scripts
storymenu_17014_2=Yes, it's me. I also helped Seven-star Pond defeat the plot of Royal Guards. And they have been chasing me.
storymenu_17015_1=Why did you make trouble in the city? Don't you fear any disaster arising from this?
storymenu_17015_2=Since it has nothing to do with me, I'd better head for the Royal Guards.
storymenu_17016_1=Be careful. Aren't they from Devil's Gate? What about those guys nearby?
storymenu_17019_1=Why did the disciples of Devil's Gate appear?
storymenu_17019_2=It was caused by ill will.
storymenu_17020_1=In the city of Yanjing? I'll go and drive them away in case they will think about Nalan Qing'er.
storymenu_17021_1=You said that secret script belongs to Five-Immortal Sect, but it is actually yours?

storymenu_17025_2=I assume Wang Xiao didn't give up.
storymenu_17025_3=I am very sorry. Is there anything I can do?
storymenu_17026_1=So there is nothing you can do?
storymenu_17026_2=It does not need to come to that. I can save your sister.
storymenu_17026_3=If I must.

storymenu_17031_3=Thank you for the information. I will see what I can find out.
storymenu_17032_1=What is it?
storymenu_17032_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Calm down. Tell me what happened.</font>
storymenu_17032_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">Where is she being held?</font>
storymenu_17033_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">May I speak with her?</font>
storymenu_17033_2=That's strange.
storymenu_17033_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">I will speak with her. Thank you.</font>
storymenu_17034_1=Your father sent me to rescue you.
storymenu_17034_2=We are leaving right now. Come on!
storymenu_17035_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Explain yourself.</font>
storymenu_17035_2=You should be ashamed.
storymenu_17035_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >(sigh) I will retrieve your money. We will speak again.</font>
storymenu_17036_1=Uh, sure. So does the old man live around here or not?
storymenu_17036_2=But what?
storymenu_17036_3=I'll keep that in mind. Thank you.
storymenu_17037_1=I can work hard! I used to serve tea.
storymenu_17037_2=You won't regret this, thank you. Nice hat by the way.
storymenu_17037_3=Right, I'll be going now.
storymenu_17038_1=I'll do whatever it takes to start over. Anything else?
storymenu_17038_2=Somehow, this feels like home already. I'll be back.
storymenu_17039_1=Can he wait? I’m afraid I’m booked for this week.
storymenu_17039_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >That will make my life interesting. But why kill you?</font>
storymenu_17039_3=I’d better get back to the tavern then. Goodbye.
storymenu_17040_1=What I need is three vicious groups off my back. Any ideas?
storymenu_17040_2=Thanks, I'll remember that. Farewell then.
storymenu_17041_1=I never stole anything, and Wang Xiao is no friend.
storymenu_17041_2=I'm just trying to start a new life.
storymenu_17041_3=If I wanted to play games I wouldn’t have picked this one.
storymenu_17042_1=Look, I never stole anything. Wang Xiao lied to you.
storymenu_17042_2=That's what criminals do, and he wanted to disappear.
storymenu_17042_3=Check your family script vault. I'm sure nothing is missing.
storymenu_17043_1=And he wants me dead as well, for helping you.
storymenu_17043_2=How do I know I can trust you?
storymenu_17043_3=I see your point.
storymenu_17044_1=Sure, I love a good challenge.
storymenu_17044_2=Thank you, I'll head there now.
storymenu_17045_1=Do we have any leads on the culprits?
storymenu_17045_2=I'll go find her right now.
storymenu_17046_1=No but your face is as green as a weed.
storymenu_17046_2=Why didn't you report this to a constable?
storymenu_17046_3=Obviously, they're criminals. Now wait here a moment.
storymenu_17047_1=Look, it's really not what you think. In fact-
storymenu_17047_2=I hope so. For now, I'd be content with staying alive.
storymenu_17048_1=Let me guess, you're not just an ordinary innocent girl?
storymenu_17048_2=I'll be back.
storymenu_17049_1=I'll be back with the snake gall.
storymenu_17050_1=What do you propose?
storymenu_17050_2=I'll head over there right now.
storymenu_17051_1=I'm an escort of Luoyang Escort Agency. A few days ago, a batch of our Escorted Goods were robbed. I suspected that Rat Gate was involved in it, so I came over to investigate it.
storymenu_17052_1=Don't mistake me because it involves too much.
storymenu_17053_1=Thank you, I'll go talk to her.
storymenu_17054_1=The Five Immortal Sect. She saw them robbing the caravan.
storymenu_17054_2=She'll be happy to hear that.
storymenu_17055_1=That explains blaming Rat Gate for the caravan robbery.
storymenu_17055_2=Thank you, it was my pleasure.
storymenu_17056_1=I never stole any Shen family script.
storymenu_17056_2=I'm telling you, I have no script.
storymenu_17056_3=Must we always do this the hard way?
storymenu_17057_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Right, sorry about that. What's the situation?</font>
storymenu_17057_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I'll check it out. </font>
storymenu_17058_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >A caravan carrying jewels was robbed, were you involved? </font>
storymenu_17058_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Sorry to bother you then, goodbye.</font>
storymenu_17059_1=No but your face is as green as a weed.
storymenu_17059_2=Why didn't you report this to a constable?
storymenu_17059_3=Obviously, they're criminals. Where are the caravan goods?
storymenu_17059_4=It's a deal, though I'm no doctor.
storymenu_17059_5=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Save it until after I've given you the antidote.</font>
storymenu_17060_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I did, now where are the stolen goods?</font>
storymenu_17060_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >This probably tastes horrible, but here's the antidote.</font>
storymenu_17061_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Dodging flying teacups from my adoptive father whenever I mixed up orders.</font>
storymenu_17061_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thank you, Chief Escort Leader. </font>

DialogID_17041=I'll follow Pond Leader. But I think we still need to consider Phantoms' Mountain Manor. Maybe they have been controlled by Royal Guards for long.
QiecuoMenu_17032=Pond Leader assigned me to ask for your opinions about cooperation with Phantoms' Mountain Manor?
QiecuoTitle_17032=<s>You? Aren't you that flunky clinging to Royal Guards in Chengdu? What? You even want to make trouble at Seven-star Pond for Royal Guards today? So that's the case, Royal Guards have worked with Phantoms' Mountain Manor to frame up our Seven-star Pond? I won't let your dream come true. Look at my move!
convoy_talk_34084_2=<s>Sister, some Royal Guards appeared around the corner while you were fighting Phantoms' Mountain Manor.
