storymenu_75402_1=<font face="Default" color="#ff0026" >(Silent for a moment)</font> <font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I did some preliminary investigation and found something suspicious.</font>
storymenu_75402_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >First, the victim was killed by someone with an axe from behind. If he was attacked accidently because of a quarrel, it is usually impossible to have only one opening on his body. Secondly, Xiao Hezi was not covered with a drop of blood, which is also weird.</font>
storymenu_75402_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I investigated the room and there were a few Abrasion Marks on the table. Looks like some kind of mechanism set to make a sound.</font>
storymenu_75402_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >If the owner was already dead when Xiao Hezi arrived in his room, the culprit should have used the short time he spent in the kitchen waiting for the snacks.</font>
storymenu_75402_5=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Good, I think it is better to ask the residents one by one. Let's see if there is anything suspicious.</font>
storymenu_75403_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Then I'll check out the Di Room.</font>
storymenu_75404_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >May I ask what you were doing between lunch today and the time the owner was attacked?</font>

storymenu_75409_1=<font face="Default" color="#ff0213" >(Calming Incense... Could it be that the reason I was unconscious?...

storymenu_75410_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Did you see the two girls in the room at the same time?</font>

storymenu_75411_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thank you.</font>
storymenu_75412_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >In the entire Shocking House, only Xiao Hezi has no power. Perfect for a scapegoat. Because he often stayed with me, you went inside when my room was empty and laid Calming Incense, one to do it and one to keep watch. And then I fainted because of the Calming Incense in the Ren Room. After losing the witness, Xiao Hezi became the obvious murderer.</font>
storymenu_75412_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ha! As early as when Xiao Hezi went to the kitchen to wait for the drink, you had already killed the owner. The reason why the sound came later was entirely because Xiao Hezi panicked and touched the trap you laid. You know, the common young people don't have the special scent of your faction. What? Want to go to the owner's room and sniff?</font>
storymenu_75412_3=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >If I hadn't heard the conversation from outside the house, I wouldn't have thought that the Yuan Yao was pretending she couldn't speak.</font>
storymenu_75412_4=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >At that time, you killed the owner while your sister was waiting for the waiter at Private Room. However, the medicine was delivered by Ping Ze, who is highly skilled in martial arts. She imitated your voice and talked to Ping Ze, opened the door, took the medicine and hurriedly closed the door. That way, no one would suspect you when you sneak back to your room.</font>
storymenu_75412_5=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The innocent Xiao Hezi came to the owner's room to deliver food, mistakenly got caught in a trap and made a noise, and then was arrested as a murderer.</font>
storymenu_75412_6=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You framed the innocent Xiao Hezi for revenge. Does it make you any different from him?</font>
storymenu_75413_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Although they framed Xiao Hezi, they are bitter with misery and deserve pity.</font>
storymenu_75414_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >...</font> <font face="Default" color="#f90227" >(What action is that?)</font>
storymenu_75415_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Right.</font>
storymenu_75415_2=<font face="Default" color="#ff0008" >(This banquet turned up to be a ploy...)</font>
storymenu_75416_1=<font face="Default" color="#ff021b" >(This is too strange)</font> <font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Can I see Xiao Hezi?</font>
storymenu_75416_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >zzzZZz…zzZZZzzzz...</font>
storymenu_75417_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Get up quickly and you tell me what happened.</font>
storymenu_75417_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Did the kitchen order you to deliver the food?</font>

storymenu_75418_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Do you remember how long Xiao Hezi waited in the kitchen when he came to pick up the snack?</font>
