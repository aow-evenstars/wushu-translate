dialogid_54601=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">Shuang Shuang can have the sword, she likes that kind of stuff much more than I do. Me, I'd rather play with my kite, but it was blown away. Can you get it back for me?</font>
dialogid_54603=<s>Ok, I got it. I am about to send the disciples to the mountain yard to rescue them.

dialogid_54617=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">She was so careless. I will dispatch other disciples to investigate. As for Fang Yingxuan, she will be punished.</font>
dialogid_54618=<s>After some consideration, I think I was in the wrong. I will apologize to elder sister. Thank you.
dialogid_54619=<s>Ok, I got it. Thanks for informing me. Please tell our Leader.
dialogid_54620=<s>My mother won't let me out. Can you help me convince her otherwise?
