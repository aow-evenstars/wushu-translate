DialogID_35301=Are you lured here by the fragrance of my wine? Alright, I will let you have a taste.
DialogID_35302=Amitabha. Why teachings of Shaolin are compared to these dirty moves on this handwritten note? Something more must be happening.
DialogID_35305=Amitabha. I am untaught and do not know what this is. Goodbye.

DialogID_35308=If I am right then this paper is made of a special herb. Use spring water as ink to write on it and after it dries, the words will disappear. This special herb grows in the mountains of Shaolin. They look very unique so you will have no problem recognizing them. Collect 10 of them and give them to me. I will use them to uncover what is written there.
DialogID_35311=You must have been lured here by my wine. Let me give you a taste.
DialogID_35312=This monkey is very smart. Feed this fish to it and it will follow you back. There are a lot of wild dogs and wild boars around here. Do not let them hurt the monkey.
DialogID_35314=That is why I am worried. Because the Tower Forest and Sutra Pavilion is deep inside the mountain of Shaolin and well-guarded, so no strangers can easily enter. But you were ambushed there and almost died. It means those people are very powerful and have access to Shaolin mountain. Maybe someone betrayed Shaolin.
DialogID_35315=Shaolin have been the leader of the righteous for thousands of years. How could there be a traitor who went to work for Wanderer's Valley? I think this have something to do with Lunatic. Maybe the Lunatic came back and did not tell us. Go ask Lunatic's old friends and check to see if he have returned.
QiecuoMenu_35304=Please, sir!
QiecuoTitle_35304=Amitabha. You have no manners. Today I will help your master teach you a lesson!
