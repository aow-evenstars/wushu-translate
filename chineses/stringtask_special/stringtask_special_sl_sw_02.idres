
DialogID_47660=I don't have any good stuff. But you can go find some Cacti. They are the delicacy of the desert.
DialogID_47661=They came pretty quick this time. Go give him the Admission Certificate I hid nearby.
DialogID_47662=It's our duty. Can you help me find some Radix Macrotomiae? Some guards are having a fever.
DialogID_47663=Looks like we are back in business. There is some Scattered Jewelry. Give it to the gatekeepers.
DialogID_47664=I'm exhausted. Help me take it.
DialogID_47665=How thoughtful of him. But I don't trust him. You try it first.
DialogID_47666=Hmph. I have never heard of that rule.
DialogID_47667=Rest assured. I have another way to get past.
DialogID_47668=Haha. Finally there is more work.
DialogID_47669=Those outsiders are indeed without manners.
DialogID_47670=What? Why would I work with this Horse Thief?
DialogID_47671=I could join them. But aren't the soldiers always suppressing them?
DialogID_47672=There is nothing special about these lizards. I'm looking for rare creatures. Not these worthless things.
DialogID_47673=These people got something to do with those Yang Pass Soldiers. You can find out over there.
DialogID_47674=That's just my subordinates eliminating the Horse Thieves. Why? You want to protect them?
DialogID_47675=Alright. Go give them a surprise first. Me and the army will be right behind you.
DialogID_47676=Go knock down their arrogance.
DialogID_47677=What? In his dreams! I will find him to settle scores.
DialogID_47678=Cultivators like us don't care about any material things.
DialogID_47679=You're too polite. Thank master Ku Hai for me, for giving me a place to stay. It's great here.
DialogID_47680=For a person like me, a tile above the head is enough.

okmenu_47675=I know.
okmenu_47676=I got it.
okmenu_47677=In the future, Shao Jingjing will not listen to your orders anymore.
okmenu_47678=Master Bitter Sea requested that I come forth to query you on your living habits. I ask for your forgiveness if it bothers you.
okmenu_47679=Is there anything which you are not used to?
okmenu_47680=Are you accustomed to living here? Is there anything you need?
story_47660_1=I used to have a happy family, until two monks came into our fate - they robbed us and kidnapped my wife.
story_47661_1=Since young, I have always wanted to eliminate the inequity of our time, so I left home to wander, hoping to spread the message to the world.
story_47661_2=A pity that the world has so many people, but who are unwilling to listen to me. Are you willing to listen?
story_47662_1=You listened to my grandfather say that a long time ago, it was still not yet a desert here. There were lush forests, and people lived carefree lives.
story_47662_2=However, all of a sudden, it did not rain for a year, the crops wilted, and the forest slowly disappeared. It was not conducive for living here and so the majority of people left.
story_47662_3=Some were too old to move, some did not want to leave the lands of our forefathers. People started to look for sources of water. Suddenly, the Crescent Spring miraculously appeared, giving hope to the once hopeless people.
story_47662_4=Later, people slowly returned. The Crescent Spring brought us opportunity and hope, so we gave it a pretty name - Crescent Spring.
story_menu_47660=I am all ears.
story_menu_47661=Since young, I have always wanted to be a wandering monk.
story_menu_47662=Why do you say that?

storymenu_47660_2=Let me help you!
storymenu_47661_1=Your ideas are noble.
storymenu_47661_2=I am willing.
storymenu_47662_1=Then how did it become like this?
storymenu_47662_2=Then why did people stay?
storymenu_47662_3=Then what happened?
storymenu_47662_4=So Crescent Spring had such a background story.
