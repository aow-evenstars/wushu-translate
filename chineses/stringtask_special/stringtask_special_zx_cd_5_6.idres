okmenu_17123=One of my friends was injured. Will you please give me some poison-clearing medicine?
okmenu_17124=What happened to you? You have lost your consciousness and seem to be seriously empoisoned.
okmenu_17125=Your symptom is caused by venomous insects. Do not use your Energy.
okmenu_17126=Well, I felt a touch of evil breath at my first sight of this jade plate.
okmenu_17127=Sister Lan, Yu Changfeng is outside the town. Go to look after him.
okmenu_17128=Yu Changfeng has suffered from Insect poison. He wears the jade plate of your sect. I suspect that the matter is related to you.
okmenu_17130=Ok, I'll immediately go to find some snake galls.
okmenu_17131=Do you have snake galls, girl? Abbot Xuanhuai is in dire need of them.
okmenu_17132=Thank you, Master. Here, on behalf of Mount Song Sword Sect, I first thank you.
okmenu_17133=Well, master, I'll immediately go to Beggar's Sect to find out more.
okmenu_17134=The Shaolin abbot ordered me to come to Beggar's Sect to investigate the poison affair.
okmenu_17135=The Shaolin abbot ordered me to find the leader and learn about the poison affair.
okmenu_17136=I'm not a contact of Royal Guards and Shaolin Abbot can verify it.
okmenu_17137=Are you okay, Leader? Hold on and I'll go there immediately.
okmenu_17138=Leader Xiao ... you ... (sweat)
okmenu_17139=Seemingly Leader Xiao doesn't know this, either.
okmenu_17140=Do you know about my identity, Leader Xiao?
okmenu_17141=Who is the girl who comes to Beggar's Sect? Does she want to see the Leader?
okmenu_17142=No, Leader Xiao won't behave like that. Let me find Pakchoi to get some information.
okmenu_17143=Pakchoi has always loved you very much. Leader is also a righteous person. I'm going to go ask help from Leader Xiao for you.
okmenu_17144=Thanks for your favor, Leader Xiao.
okmenu_17145=The leader said he would make a feast
okmenu_17146=Ah! Who? How dare you launch a sneak attack here? They are assassins arranged by Bao Sangu. Let me deal with them.
okmenu_17147=Bao Sangu didn't agree to the affair of Fei Bai and Pakchoi, and assigned assassins to kill Fei Bai

okmenu_17149=So magical? I think I am some smart. I'm going to enter to have a try.
story_17102_3=He does not like me! Even Hua Er won't help me!
story_17107_1=This poison is difficult to eliminate completely. In addition to precious medicine Huanhua, we still need Danxia Grass.
story_17107_2=Actually it's not so hard to obtain Danxia Grass. I knew a little about the Guardianship Maze.
story_17107_3=of course, this array was set for Nine Yin Manual at that time and I happen to
story_17108_1=This array was set by Shenji Old Man at that time. Entering it will be affected by its breath, your view in particular. Danxia Grass is right there in the way you can't see. You'll find Danxia Grass as long as you can find you way to avoid the effect of psychedelic breath in the array.

story_17110_1=Why did you save a hidden traitor of the Imperial Court?
story_17110_2=You are lying! He is a source of the Imperial Court. We've investigated it clearly. So no more explanation?
story_17111_1=Yu Changfeng has been acting strangely.
story_17111_2=Seemingly empoisoned. Bitten by him, the wound will fester and can't scar over. What should we do? How should we treat it...
story_17122_1=Our sect has nothing to do with this. Some of our own disciples have lost their sanity.
story_17122_2=Bitten by the empoisoned disciples in the sect, the wounds will fester and can't scar over. A number of herbs were applied but wouldn't help. So I'm worried about it.
story_17123_1=Who I want to find isn't The Beggar's Sect leader, but a Begging Novice called Pakchoi.
story_17123_2=He is my lover. I came to ask him why he has been avoiding me.
story_17124_1=I'm Pakchoi. I'm a beggar and don't have a permanent living address. I couldn't provide Fei Bai with a happy marriage, thus I had to avoid her. I hope she can forget me.
story_17124_2=I love her and I will make her happy through my greatest efforts. I spent the money saved for 3 months to buy a Mandarin Duck Pouch for her as a love token. Unexpectedly it was stolen by a punk. Please help me get it back.
story_17125_1=What? You're a liar! Yingfeng doesn't know you. How can he tell you this? Woo, it's not true, woo-woo...
story_17125_2=Woo woo...I know he doesn't love me. But I love him only. I don't know what to do without him. Woo woo...
story_17125_3=My wishful thinking only. of course I know the intimacy of him and Elder Martial Sister Ximen. Despite initial expectation, now I finally understood it. Don't worry, I'll survive it. I hope there is another good man like Elder Brother Yingfeng waiting for me in the world. Thank you, it was you who helped lift that weight in my innermost heart.
story_17126_1=Everything was caused by her. She was in bad mood but blamed other people. I can't help scolding her last time she went into a rage against Younger Martial Sister. Consequently she wanted to fight against me. Since then we have never talked to each other.
story_17127_1=There is still poison in my body, I need an elixir to prevent me from dying.
story_menu_17107=One of my friends was poisoned by Five-Immortal Sect. I came here for the antidote.
