QiecuoTitle_13129=If it's so, then I won't let it end well.

okmenu_13126=(It seems the taoist came for it more than once.)
okmenu_13127=That's brave.
okmenu_13128=You find trouble on me everywhere. I'll give you a lesson.
okmenu_13129=You lied. I know everything about you.
okmenu_13130=I asked already. No. No one knows why the Wanderers Valley people come to Wudang.
okmenu_13131=Qing Shan asked me to send the letter to you.
okmenu_13132=The Head Master asks me to help you investigate the issue of betrayers.
okmenu_13133=
okmenu_13134=Please don't misunderstand. I'm from Wanderers Valley too. I mean no harm.
okmenu_13135=I found that the betrayers are poisoned. They have no choice but follow orders.
okmenu_13136=You are the one I'm looking for.
okmenu_13137=Is there an antidote to cure the poison on the Wudang apprentice? (I was poisoned too. It won't last long without a cure.)
okmenu_13138=I killed the fierce tiger. Don't worry.
okmenu_13139=Only the one who used the poison knows how to completely cure it.
okmenu_13140=Immortal Zi Yang sends me here. Even though you have white hair, your facial features look very young. You must be an exceptional martial art master.
okmenu_13141=Taoist Zhang sends me to duel you.
okmenu_13142=Yes.
okmenu_13143=It's really serious. I'll leave now.
okmenu_13144=He was injured and thus can't go far.
okmenu_13145=People in jianghu already take life off their first priority.
okmenu_13146=(What a surprise that he has Seven Star Diagram. It doesn't take that much effort. I will take it.) Take care.
okmenu_13147=No, he is way too powerful. We are not a match.
story_13126_1=There are some betrayers in Wudang recently. They secretly team with Wanderers Valley people and plan to put Wudang in danger. I left the mountain to investigate this issue. The taoist you mentioned must have something to do with it.
story_13127_1=I'm not a taoist. My cousin is one. He is responsible for welcoming guests. He is ill recently, so I fill his role for a few days.
story_13127_2=It's nothing much. I only took some incense money and told some lies to get free food. I don't deserve to die. I have an 80 year old mother, a wife and a daughter to take care of. Please spare my life. And Xiang Jiuchen is from Wudang. He will take you to meet the head master.
story_13128_1=Who are you? You are not supposed to be here.
story_13128_2=We are from the same school. My name is Qi Wanli. Liu Changwei is my elder brother. The valley leader sends us here to fetch the Seven Star Array Diagram.
story_13129_1=There is a mysterious organization recently, that wants Wanderers Valley to join it. The Valley Leader rejected it and is worried the organization will attack Wanderers Valley. So he studies the defensive arrays and finds that combining Wudang's Seven Star Array and Wanderers Valley's Void Array will boost array power a lot. That's why he sends many disciples to get it.
story_13130_1=You are indeed poisoned. It starts because of Wudang. We will take the responsibility. Never mind. Go find Zhang Sanfeng in the northern golden hall. He is exceptional in martial arts and is very knowledgable. He will have a solution. If you are lucky, he may give you some advice too.
story_13130_2=The case of our elder is Wudang's secret. Please don't spread it outside.
story_13131_1=Your meridians are different from normal people. They need continuous internal power to show the full potential. I put in a bit of my internal power. That's why your power level is significantly increased in a short time and you are able to defeat Taoist Leader Mu Xu.
story_13131_2=Do you want to join Wudang and learn Taichi from me?
story_13131_3=80 years.
story_13131_4=As for the poison in you. If you try to cure it now, you will get hurt. Only if you wait to cure it after your internal power comes stronger will it be safe for you. For now let me use my internal power to suppress the poison. Don't worry. You can go find Immortal Zi Yang.
story_13132_1=No one in Wanderers Valley is scared of death. I won't leave until I get the diagram. It's unlikely for me to get the Seven Star Array Diagram. How about you try to get Wudang's trust and then manage to get the diagram? If you succeed, I will be happy even if I have to die.
