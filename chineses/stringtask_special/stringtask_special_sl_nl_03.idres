
DialogID_44800=You are also asking for directions? So many strangers are here recently and none of them know the way. Go straight then take a right.
DialogID_44801=Those medicine worked well. These Poison Insects I'm cultivating are all very powerful.
DialogID_44802=Here is master's urn. I need some Green Grass to feed these Insects. Can you help me collect some?
DialogID_44803=<s>How dare you interfere my business? You must be looking for a beating. Let me have some fun with you.
DialogID_44804=It's all my fault that she is angry. I'm so clumsy. These Amatista Flowers here are so pretty. Help me collect some for her. I hope she can forgive me.
DialogID_44805=These criminals are too strong and there are too many of them. We must find backup if we want to leave. I already made preparations. Just light this firework.
DialogID_44806=He was a bandit but he left behind his evil ways and became a good man. He hasn't committed another crime ever since. Can you help me break this wood stick? I will take it back and use it as firewood.
DialogID_44807=I'm in need of help. I'm a woodcutter and there is a lot of dry wood over there. But there are also many Five-colors Poison Spiders nearby. Can you help me kill those spiders and take back some wood?
DialogID_44808=How can you trust anyone in Jianghu? Say no more. Only strength grants one the right to speak in Wulin. Let me see you kill some Poison Emissary's Martial Slaves first if you disagree.
DialogID_44809=Fine. I'll trust you this time.
DialogID_44810=Is the medicine almost ready? Looks like we need more Xianzhi Herb. Can you help me collect some?
DialogID_44811=These will be enough for a while. Go tell my servant he can take a break after the medicine is finished.
DialogID_44812=I don't know much about cultivating insects. I only know you need to be careful when deciding what to feed them, and when to feed them.
DialogID_44813=There are many different kinds of insects, and each of them is cultivated differently. This is important.
DialogID_44814=Other than that… I don't remember much. You will know everything sooner or later if you stay long enough.
DialogID_44815=<s>Bai Yufeng betrayed her sect and caused the death of her master. Why would I help her Five-poison Followers? Hurry and drive away those Cult Believers or I will do it myself.
DialogID_44817=I see. So that's why villa leader Ximen is not here yet. Help me tell him it's no problem, and that I'll be waiting.

okmenu_44800=Thank you.
okmenu_44801=I'll go tell him the result.
okmenu_44802=No problem.
okmenu_44803=Shameless culprit! You only bully the weak!
okmenu_44804=You are not that stupid after all. I'll help you collect some.
okmenu_44805=I'll listen to you.
okmenu_44806=That you're incompetent. If you're not doing anything about the hoodlums, then I am!
okmenu_44807=I see. Guess I thought too much.
okmenu_44808=These amateurs could be easily handled!
okmenu_44809=Thank you.
okmenu_44810=That you're incompetent. If you're not doing anything about the hoodlums, then I am!
okmenu_44811=I'll tell him.
okmenu_44812=Where is the rest?
okmenu_44813=It's so specifically distinguished?
okmenu_44814=Of course. Alright, thanks. I need to go check on your master's insect now.
okmenu_44815=It's a misunderstanding. Please forgive me.
okmenu_44817=The Elder Ximen Chuixue will be busy tomorrow in the villa and will not be able to visit you. He asked me to come apologize for him.
story_44800_1=I studied in the Fallen-flower Valley, a sect that vanished from Jianghu long ago. I remember one hundred years ago there were Fallen-flower Disciples everywhere, but now no one knows of us and I'm the last one alive.
story_44800_2=The healing skills of Fallen-flower valley are powerful and different from the others on Jianghu. We are confident in our skills as doctors.
story_44800_3=I want to collect the Poison Dispelling Lotus growing near here, but the Five-Immortal Sect Poison Emissaries stopped me. Can you help me?
story_44801_1=The Wind Chasing Sword is a treasured sword from my sect and it was stolen. I took it back from those thieves but the sword is dusty. It was hidden for too long. Can you help me clean it?
story_44815_1=I'm Zhuo Zhaoran! Back then I participated in the Mount Hua martial contest with Jiugong Elder.
story_44815_2=There were so many people. It took me quite an effort to find a front row seat. Watching those fighting competitions was the experience of a lifetime.
story_44815_3=Of course. If it were you, you wouldn't even be able to squeeze into the crowd!
story_menu_44800=You're so skilful. Where did you learn your healing skills from?
story_menu_44801=Wind Chasing Sword? Can you tell me more?
story_menu_44815=Please tell me.

storymenu_44800_1=I see. What does it mean to not treat the living? Do you only treat the dead?
storymenu_44800_2=Did the master doctor come here to do something important?
storymenu_44800_3=I will do what you say.
storymenu_44801_1=OK.
storymenu_44815_1=Nice to meet you.
storymenu_44815_2=It must be hard to find a seat in such a large crowd. You must be an expert.
