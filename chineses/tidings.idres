bagua00535=Elder Brother <a href="findnpc_new,school03,WorldNpc03441" style="HLStype1">Lu Yunxiao</a> came to Scholars with me, but he was attacked by a group of wild dogs on the way, and I don't know how is he now.

bagua00569=The villagers there have been working  in the coal mine for all their lives, but they couldn't even have coal to make themselves warm after they were fired.
bagua00570=My neighbor across the road asked me if I knew anyone who knew how to fight. Maybe he's in trouble?
bagua00571=I don't like playing across the street because the elder there is so serious.
bagua00572=We've been neighbors for years. I'll return anything I borrow from you. Don't be so stingy.

bagua00575=The censor behind me is an honest official. He is here for a secret foreign matter.
bagua00576=We Oroqen People are all straightforward men. All men will work hard for our villages, and no one will loaf on the job.

bagua00578=You are all cowards. Is there no one who will accept my challenge?
bagua00579=Some foreigners are living out there. They're having troubles.
bagua00580=The beggar there is mysterious. I saw a bandit get really scared just from watching him. That's weird.
bagua00581=I've been brewing wine all my life and have seen all kinds of men. Some men drink for pleasure and some men drink to get drunk. Only that beggar does both. He's a rarity.
bagua00582=That old dirty beggar always comes to my place to beg. Did he try to steal my stuff?
bagua00583=Eh! Why does this raunchy beggar look like the old man who helped me drive off the bandits on the road outside the town?
bagua00584=They exploit us. Unexpectedly, an outsider could help us.
bagua00585=I don't know what the Nvzhen person here for. He is pretty busy everyday.
bagua00586=We Jurchen People are all well skilled, straightforward and unruly. Moreover, we can drink much. One of us can make a group of Han People drunk.
bagua00587=The Jerchen person over there is interesting. In my opinion, he may be an expert from the Jerchen tribe. Why is he in the Han people's area? I'd better be careful.
bagua00588=Martial Brothers and I have changed gradually since we first started practicing martial arts in the martial arts club. We can't help competing with people with Kung Fu.
bagua00589=If we wish to be respected, we must be straightforward.

bagua00619=We admire General Ha Weihua because he garrisons the frontiers. He is loyal to the country. (Dunhuang Town in Northern Desert)
bagua00620=Thankfully, Wang Liang helped me drive away the bandits. (Iron Mirror Pass in Northern Desert)
bagua00621=Xiao Xiao is famous in this region. The reason why he is so famous? I'm sure you will find out soon enough! (Iron Mirror Pass in Northern Desert)
bagua00622=It's impressing that Brother Cang defends the frontier in a persistent way. (Tiejing Pass in Northern Desert)
bagua00623=Cui Chen is the only man among all those I've known who truly deserves to be called a hero. (Yumen Pass in Northern Desert)
bagua00624=Master Qin Qi is acting strangely. Has she been reading too many of those scriptures? (Bright Moon Tower in Northern Desert)
bagua00625=Xue Xiaofeng is clever but also very naughty. (Yumen Pass in Northern Desert)
bagua00626=How can I be friends with a person like Mo Dangcai? Big mistake. (Iron Mirror Pass in Northern Desert)
bagua00627=Our Stockade Leader is looking for some papers that look like cards... If you have some I will send them to the Stockade Leader for you and you will get rewards later.
bagua00629=It's just my complain. I have to intensify the followers in my stronghold for the things on the paper.
bagua00630=Qin Tianbao is very foxy and sinister. According to my observation, he is too ambitious. If we don’t stop him right now, he will have his own power being the vice castle master and make some chaos here.
bagua00631=Vice Leader Qin has been in quite a good mood, lately. You should take this oppportunity to get on his good side and try to get him to promote me...
bagua00632=The Village Head is looking for a hero who could help us surpass the bandits and complete an important commission.

bagua00640=I get along well with Dongfang Family. They always come to me when they need information.

bagua00642=The second Villa Leader may secretly investigate the Water Hole Sky. I accidentally heard about it. Don’t take it too serious.
bagua00643=No matter who is in power, as long as he makes a contribution to Dongfang family. Why do you cast greedy eyes on the place on the sly?
bagua00644=It said that the former lord of Dongfang family has given something to Xuan Tou for safe keeping. The man who is in Xuan Tou's good graces must be very talented.
bagua00645=Elder brother always wanted to find a person who is both smart and virtuous. An ideal apprentice, it seems...
bagua140001=<a href="findnpc_new,city02,WorldNpc01999" style="HLStype1">Lu Xia</a> over there seems quite worried and sad. Could it be about her love life?
bagua140002=<a href="findnpc_new,city02,WorldNpc01999" style="HLStype1">Lu Xia</a> over there seems lonely, but at the same time shies away from men. Do you think she likes girls, instead?
bagua140003=The man named Ke Jun must have owed <a href="findnpc_new,city02,WorldNpc01999" style="HLStype1">Sister Lu Xia</a> a lot of money, otherwise, she wouldn't always ask where Ke Jun is.
bagua60006=Many people have been ill lately. Even the doctors can't cure them. Disciples of the Beggar's Sect have been examining them round the clock. I hope they can recover their health as soon as possible.
bagua60007=Elder Brother Zhan has been quite busy recently, what with the mysterious disease and the Beggar's Sect refugees in Juyi Hall.
bagua60008=This rash little beggar doesn't take care when he walks. I'll punish him if there's nothing in his hand and he's also in a rush.
bagua60010=Xiao Hou'er is very nice. He is always searching for herbs for sick people.
bagua60011=Poor little monkey!

bagua60013=Some cloudy souls have joined the Beggar's Sect recently. The elders are looking into it.

bagua60015=The Elders of the Beggar's Sect are all hypocrites.
bagua60017=A few days ago, I saw Gongyang Rongxuan in Qiandeng Town. There seemed to be a strange disease there.
bagua60018=I overheard a man who was sitting against a wall talking about some kind of disease. I wonder if he is a doctor… or if that disease is present in this place.
bagua50019=I think sometimes. It's a special enjoyment for drinking, sleeping and basking all day like the drunkard over there.
bagua50020=Surprisingly, the drunk gambler to the north ended up giving the beggar some silver. Now if only people would stop harassing such kindhearted people!
bagua50021=That drunk gambler's name is Hu Sanzhang, who strangely enough has the same name of the last disciple of the famous Secret Device Skill. Though he has been missing for quite a while, so I'm sure this is just a coincidence.
bagua50022=I can't believe he chose to give up all his dreams for one woman. Now all he does is drink  and gamble everyday.
bagua50023=Being straight, tall, young, righteous, handsome, elegant, straightforward, unruly, intelligent and the commander of Royal Guards, he is exactly the perfect man in my dream.
bagua50024=We Royal Guards are responsible for overseeing the martial arts world. We also know many ancient martial arts secrets.
bagua50025=I have to collect every penny of taxes… Or the Royal Guards will come after me. I've heard the recent Royal Guards Chief is very rigorous.
bagua50026=They say that the Royal Guards Commander on the Central Plains is quite skilled. I will go learn from him.
bagua50027=I'm ashamed to be so close to such a man. So meticulous, yet you wouldn't expect that from his appearance.
bagua50031=The homeless beggar over there must have beeen kicked out of the Beggar's Sect. I've seen him sneaking around in my field several times.
bagua50032=According to my years' of experience of supervising people. The wandering beggar over the wall must be a person with stories. Because I can see the ashamed expression on his face.
bagua50033=The head of a rising cult is the same so-called traitor that escaped from the Beggar's Sect many years ago. He was actually framed by a fellow disciple named Hong Bao.
bagua50034=The weapon merchant over there is edgy and rugged, actually he is afraid of his wife seriously in private! <a href="findnpc_new,school04,FuncNpc01410" style="HLStype1"></a>
bagua50035=<a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03847" style="HLStype1">Zeng Yijian</a> is writing letters to a particular friend way too often these days.
bagua50036=Nowadays, it's hard to do everything. Let's use <a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc04024" style="HLStype1">Du Juanyue</a> weaving over there as an example. She may prick her hands at any moment.
bagua50037=Several days ago, I met a person called <a href="findnpc_new,school04,JlgNpc039" style="HLStype1">Bai Jinyu</a> on the mountain. Unexpectedly, he took me to try some medicine. It was absolutely awful!
bagua50038=<a href="findnpc_new,school04,JlgNpc185" style="HLStype1"> Sheng Ping </a> cannot be more stupid . Probably he's only good at eating.
bagua50039=<a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03813" style="HLStype1"> Poison emissary </a> asks us to be experimented every time she's got a new formula. It's horrible! Well, she's so pretty that I cannot refuse it.
bagua50040=I don't know what human blood tastes like, but <a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03996" style="HLStype1">Ghost Emissary</a> likes to drink it a lot. I'll ask him for some if I get a chance.
bagua50041=<a href="findnpc_new,school04,JlgNpc146" style="HLStype1">Zha Xiao</a> refuses to speak to me. She's so beautiful! What can I do?
bagua50042=That <a href="findnpc_new,school04,JlgNpc139" style="HLStype1">clerk</a> does his job with such zeal, it's rather intimidating.
bagua50043=Young love is ever so fickle. Lamentably, <a href="findnpc_new,school04,JlgNpc013" style="HLStype1">Du Chan</a> is afflicted with this malady.
bagua50044=<a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc04015" style="HLStype1"> Wei Tian </a> is looking around now an then. Is he waiting for someone?
bagua50045=<a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc04010" style="HLStype1"> Jia Changshan </a> is such a nuisance!
bagua50046=<a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03889" style="HLStype1">Pi Sihu</a> first stumbled into this region with the intent of dominating over others. Now he can barely stand on his two feet.
bagua50047=The two sects Yaksha and Shura have fallen out with each other. But you have to be careful with <a href="findnpc_new,school04,JlgNpc032" style="HLStype1">Xiahou Chi</a> from Shura. He is quite dangerous.
bagua50048=<a href="findnpc_new,school04,JlgNpc024" style="HLStype1">Yu Tong</a> seems quite worried about something. Would you be willing to talk to her?
bagua50049=Only a person who can pas? <a href="findnpc_new,school04,WorldNpc03900" style="HLStype1">Xu Chengda</a>'s test can qualify for the teaching of the sage.
bagua50050=In this fickle world, only the poor retain any honor. Had it not been for that floor sweeper, I would probably have died.
bagua50051=Only discontentment with reality can show the resistance in one's heart. I need that type of follower for my sect. That sweeping servant in the distance has already had pressure enough...
bagua50052=An old man to clean such a big place? How can he possibly do it?
bagua50053=Our spies are all over the world. Maybe an inconspicuous Sweeping Servant is a Secret Spy.
bagua50054=I'm a deserter, but that doesn't make me a coward - some manipulative little devil simply wishes to control my mind.
