CanAcceptMenu_34292=What can I do now? Please arrange, Helmsman.
CanAcceptMenu_34293=Banxian, what should I do next?
CanAcceptMenu_34294=I'd like to know what caused the empoisoning event.
CanAcceptMenu_34295=Brother Ma, I've long heard that you're well-informed. Can you give me some news?
CanAcceptMenu_34296=The thing has become complex due to intervention of the Imperial Court.
CanAcceptMenu_34297=What's your plan, Leader Xiao. I'll do it right now.
CanAcceptMenu_34298=What are you laughing at, Leader Yu? I'm serious.
CanAcceptMenu_34299=I'm not lying. The Beggar's Sect Leader asked me to send the letter.
CanAcceptMenu_34300=I have a foreboding that we're enticed out.
CanAcceptMenu_34301=How about I find a doctor? I was enticed out by the enemies.
CanAcceptMenu_34302=That's none of your business. I can kill you even if you run to the ends of the earth.
CanAcceptMenu_34303=Leader Yu, do you feel better?
CanAcceptMenu_34304=Feel better this time? I've always had a foreboding.
CanAcceptMenu_34305=Are you alright?
CanAcceptMenu_34306=What are you going to do next?
CanAcceptMenu_34307=Brother Yu, what else I can do for you?
CanAcceptMenu_34309=It seems that you're poisoned.
CanAcceptMenu_34310=How do you feel, brother?
CanAcceptMenu_34311=Mr. Yan, do you have any plan?
CanAcceptMenu_34312=Be real? Please tell me clearly.
CanAcceptMenu_34313=What else can I do for you, Mr. Yan?
CanAcceptMenu_34314=What else can I do for you?
CanAcceptMenu_34315=Madam, here is my salute to you. Yan Guhong is safe now.
CanAcceptMenu_34316=Why do you sigh, Leader?
CanAcceptMenu_34317=It's all over now.
CanAcceptMenu_34319=Sir, here is my salute to you.
CanAcceptMenu_34320=Brother Dongfang, is there something you want to see me about?
CanAcceptMenu_34321=Brother Hong, why are you worried?
CanAcceptMenu_34322=What else can I do for you?
CanAcceptMenu_34324=Don't cry, Xiao Ye. Let me help you.
CanAcceptMenu_34325=What do you want to see me about, sir?
CanAcceptMenu_34326=What else is there, sir?
CanAcceptMenu_34327=Will there be anything else, Miss Long?
CanAcceptMenu_34329=I've come to visit you since I've long heard of the reputation of Nangong Family.
CanAcceptMenu_34330=Mr. Nangong, I don't mean that...
CanAcceptMenu_34331=It still doesn't work.
CanAcceptMenu_34332=Cough...Mr. Nangong, I was wounded in the fight just now.
CanAcceptMenu_34333=Thanks for your advice and instruction, sir.
CompleteMenu_34291=Helmsman Yan, the Leader has sent me to investigate the empoisoning event.
CompleteMenu_34292=I'm back. Is this the Samadhi Herb you want?
CompleteMenu_34293=Mr. Ma, Ma Banxian has given this Antidote.
CompleteMenu_34294=You've misunderstood me. I've come to investigate it on behalf of the Beggar's Sect Leader.
CompleteMenu_34295=This is everything about the action...
CompleteMenu_34296=Leader, it is urgent. Please make a decision.
CompleteMenu_34297=Leader Yu, I've come to tell you that the Imperial Court will be bad for you.
CompleteMenu_34299=Are you all right, Brother Yu?
CompleteMenu_34300=Leader Yu, I'm late. Are you ok?
CompleteMenu_34301=Damned evil person, get out!
CompleteMenu_34302=Leader Yu, they should not come back again.
CompleteMenu_34303=I've picked it, though it looks withered and yellow.
CompleteMenu_34304=I brought the salamander gall!
CompleteMenu_34305=I almost killed the leader...
CompleteMenu_34307=He has perished the thought and gone to practice martial arts by himself.
CompleteMenu_34308=Brother, are you all right?
CompleteMenu_34309=I don't know if they are Antidotes in the package. Let's have a try.
CompleteMenu_34310=We should fight together and inflict heavy casualties on Xingxiu.
CompleteMenu_34311=I can do nothing about that guy. He neither listens to reason nor bows to force.
CompleteMenu_34312=I made it! I've injured Tian Xiaozi seriously.
CompleteMenu_34313=Mr. Yan, I've got the thing you want.
CompleteMenu_34314=Leader Yan, Yan Guhong asked me to give it to you
CompleteMenu_34315=Leader Yan seems to have something on his mind.
CompleteMenu_34316=Don't be sad, Leader Yan. Don't blame yourself too much.
CompleteMenu_34317=Distinguished Mr. Dongfang, here is my salute to you.
CompleteMenu_34319=Brother Dongfang, I've troubled you.
CompleteMenu_34320=Each family has its own problems.
CompleteMenu_34321=This is the stolen Sword Forging Part. I've brought it back.
CompleteMenu_34322=I'm back, Miss. I've thought those hoodlums a lesson
CompleteMenu_34324=Mr. Dongfang, here is my salute to you. What can I do for you?
CompleteMenu_34325=Sir, don't worry about this matter anymore. Leave it to me.
CompleteMenu_34326=Don't worry, Miss. I'll keep it in mind.
CompleteMenu_34327=How are you, Mr. Nangong?
CompleteMenu_34329=Sir...you misunderstood
CompleteMenu_34330=Can we stop? Bury the hatchet
CompleteMenu_34331=I'm so sorry, Mr. Nangong.
CompleteMenu_34332=Complete Task
CompleteMenu_34333=You look familiar. You're Brother Ding, aren't you?
accept_34291_1=Huo Rang just told me that something important has happened. Go have a look.
accept_34292_1=<s>We don't know the reason now, but it's important to save people first! Go to find Ma Banxian. Ask him for advice.
accept_34293_1=<s>Take this samadhi pill. Please help me take it!
accept_34294_1=<s>I don't know it either since it happened suddenly! These Antidotes truly hit the spot...Anyway, a person may know it. The villager Ma Dayuan is well-informed. You can ask him.
accept_34295_1=<s>I saw some strange people outside the village, but thought nothing of it. Did they do it?
accept_34296_1=<s>This is very important. Please return now and report to our Leader! Let him make a decision!
accept_34298_1=I think it's funny.
accept_34299_1=<s>This is very important, but father even ignores it...No, we must take precautions. I also want you to check if there's any suspicious man.
accept_34300_1=<s>Go deal with the thugs that have shown up at my father's house.
accept_34301_1=<s>That's ok. I'll be fine for the time being. Catch up with those people! They haven't gone far! I have some informers in the village. You can ask them.
accept_34302_1=Huh! If I hadn't fought with the fool who plants Chrysanthemum and wasted my Energy, I would have killed you with one slap...Anyway, I can still kill you easily! You jackal!
accept_34303_1=<s>I took the Antidote just now, but it doesn't seem to have any effect. Now I feel weak and have a strong headache.
accept_34304_1=Em, I seem to feel a little better after taking the Samadhi Herb...Hmm, too bad! ...I feel terrible! It's worse! Go to find Zhou Huang now...
accept_34305_1=<s>I've prepared this Salamander after simple treatment. Take it to the Leader. Be quick!
accept_34310_1=<s>Great! I feel much better now!
accept_34312_1=<s>Use the ecstasy fragrance on the gate guard, and he'll obey you.
accept_34313_1=<s>I wonder if Yu Qin and Cheng Liang are poisoned seriously. Go to talk with them, learn about their poisoning situation and come back to tell me.
accept_34314_1=<s>I've prepared Silk Moistening Pills with Runsi Herb. The pills can cure Yu Qin and Cheng Liang and prevent their wounds from infecting and festering. Go to remove their poison quickly. Come back to tell me after you finish it.
accept_34315_1=Thank you. Yan Qingxue has been depressed recently, I hope you can go see her.
accept_34316_1=Yan Qingxue is troubled. Please listen to me.
accept_34317_1=<s>Your weapon is poor. A good weapon can improve your strength since you go to all corners of Jinaghu. Do you want a good weapon?
accept_34319_1=<s>What are you doing here? Tell me.
accept_34320_1=I have heard you are experienced. Let's duel.
accept_34321_1=<s>Our family has been troubled these past few years. Please listen to me.
accept_34322_1=<s>I don't know what's wrong with Dongfang Qian. She's distracted. Can you go to see her?
accept_34324_1=<s>Thank you very much. Anyway, don't tell it to Miss. She will reproach me and beat me if she knows it. Please.
accept_34325_1=I'd like to discuss something with you, but...
accept_34326_1=I received a Secret Report just now. It's very important, so hear me out.
accept_34327_1=<s>You are going to investigate the matter of Nangong Family with Dongfang Zhongcheng, aren't you? Go now.
accept_34329_1=What do you want to see me about?
accept_34330_1=You're so rude!
accept_34331_1=<s>Let Nangong Lie teach you a lesson!
accept_34332_1=We have the effective herb Jinjie Grass here. Go to collect some. I'll prepare it into medicine for you.
accept_34333_1=You're welcome. You must be careful in the future.
complete_34291=You've come at the right time! Please!
complete_34292=You're really fast!
complete_34293=Great, the villagers can be saved.
complete_34294=I see. So I've blamed you wrongly. I'm sorry.

complete_34296=Be calm. In fact, this is to be expected...
complete_34297=Don't worry.
complete_34298=Is the news reliable?
complete_34299=Thank you!
complete_34300=I was attacked by a group of people just now. I've defeated them...but I seem to be poisoned. Now I can't breathe smoothly...

complete_34313=Thank you. Thank you for your great help.
