accept_6005_1=The black market exists since very long ago. I didn't expect it survive all the years. Beat the greedy people in the black market.
accept_6006_1=So, what's your next move?
accept_6007_1=To test whether the Chao Carbon is real, one will need to compare it with Tattoo Picture. Rumor has it that Mongolian Noblemen use Chao Carbon to draw tattoos. Enter the Mongolia Army and kill the person with a Tattoo Picture.
accept_6008_1=Wait a bit please. Let me test.

complete_6007=Is everything going well?
complete_6008=I can't believe it ends up like this. Why?
context_6001=It's a long story. When I was ten years old, one day I found myself abandoned outside, and I couldn't remember anything from the past. To stay alive, I begged everyday to make a living, until one day a kind hearted person took me home. He even taught me martial arts. That person is Leader Xiao. The puzzle of my background is like a heavy stone in my heart. So far, the only evidence is the Tattoo Picture on my feet. But I don't know where it comes from. Maybe it has something to do with my background.
context_6002=Ghost Legendary Doctor is weird. But he likes good wine. There is a jar of wine that I kept for many years under the big tree at the east mountain foot.
context_6003=Ghost Legendary Doctor does not have a fixed living place. Usually he lives in hidden areas far from the cities. Go to Apricot Forest and look around patiently. Maybe you can find him there.
context_6004=I will study the Tattoo Picture slowly later on. You should go to the Apricot Forest first and look for the black market. It's hidden in a mysterious area.
context_6005=The black market exists since very long ago. I didn't expect it survive all the years. Beat the greedy people in the black market.
context_6006=Take the materials with you and find an expert to do the examination.
context_6007=To test whether the Chao Carbon is real, one will need to compare it with Tattoo Picture. Rumor has it that Mongolian Noblemen use Chao Carbon to draw tattoos. Enter the Mongolia Army and kill the person with a Tattoo Picture.
context_6008=The Chao Carbon is real based on the examination. The Tattoo Picture is similar to Da Li's too. Considering everything, Da Li is from Mongolia. Pass the message to Da Li.
