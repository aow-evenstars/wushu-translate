CanAcceptMenu_42254=Hurry up and say it. How to get into Xingxiu Sect?
CanAcceptMenu_42258=No wonder Zhu Y betrayed Xingxiu Sect this time.
CanAcceptMenu_42260=You went to Xingxiu Sect to rob Royal Guard's sacrificial item. What do you think I am here for?
CanAcceptMenu_42264=Abbess Buji can't escape from the attack of Su Bailin's men in Xingxiu Sect. Please help with the rescue, Brother Jiang.
CanAcceptMenu_42265=You disciples of Xingxiu Sect are all afraid to die.
CanAcceptMenu_42269=What will happen if one uses Cauldron of the Divine Tree to cultivate?
CanAcceptMenu_42274=What to do now? If he completes the cultivation of the divine skill, he will surely make troubles in Xingxiu Sect.
CanAcceptMenu_42282=I know you always think about the Cauldron of the Divine Tree. Don't you want it now?
CompleteMenu_42241=Xingxiu Sect is more and more daring. They even dare to rob government's items now.
CompleteMenu_42242=Shifu, that jade pendant can be used to manage fifty thousand army from the government. If it has to be so, let's just destroy Xingxiu Sect with the army.
CompleteMenu_42248=That would be for the best. We can find Xingxiu Sect people to work together.
CompleteMenu_42249=That Xingxiu Sect disciple is badly injured and unconscious. He knows nothing at all.
CompleteMenu_42274=If you don't want to die, quickly tell us where Jiang Yici hides the Cauldron of the Divine Tree.
CompleteMenu_42275=This is the Cauldron of the Divine Tree you guys are looking for.
CompleteMenu_42493=Can you get Dark Steel?
complete_42242=<s>Xingxiu Sect usually is friendly to us. It's not good to offend and destroy it like this.
complete_42248=<s>This will be for the best. By then, our leader will take back the goods and we will take back the Cauldron of the Divine Tree. It's killing two birds with one stone.
complete_42253=<s>Spare my life please. I will tell you how to secretly enter Xingxiu Sect.
complete_42257=<s>Even though there are many disciples in Xingxiu Sect, most are here because they are poisoned by Su Bailing and they have to listen to him. They do not want to stay in Xingxiu Sect.
complete_42258=<s>Sage Zhaixing is very smart. He used Ice Silkworm Poison to attack me. It is a unique poison from Xingxiu Sect. Only the one who applies the poison knows the cure.
complete_42259=<s>Who are you? What are you doing here in Xingxiu Sect?
complete_42260=<s>In Xingxiu Sect, the capable ones rule. As long as you can defeat the headmaster, you can replace him.
complete_42262=<s>Xingxiu Sect disciples are all like that. They are all taught by Su Bailing. You can not trust any of them. Once I become the new headmaster, I will kill them all. Only the ones who follow me will live.
complete_42263=<s>Today the winds blow to the Xingxiu Sect. Let's see what Su Bailing can do. Even if he did not get poisoned, the Xingxiu Sect disciples would have been poisoned. I will not be afraid of him.
complete_42266=<s>You are the one who made troubles in Xingxiu Sect a few days ago? Brave. I heard from the guard disciples that the goods were stolen by Jiang Yici's followers. He robbed many other schools too. He did it so that more people will come to Xingxiu Sect and he could execute his plans while Xingxiu Sect is in chaos.
complete_42268=<s>Just now I saw Jiang Yici using the Energy-melting Skill. It is level eight already. Cauldron of the Divine Tree seems really useful. But it has side effect too.
complete_42271=<s>I'm okay. Who were the killers just now? The martial arts they used are really weird and evil. They do not look like Xingxiu Sect skills.
complete_42272=<s>I agree. Even though Xingxiu Sect has many disciples, they are all evil Jianghu people. If they see that Jiang Yici fails, they of course will follow me instead.
complete_42275=<s>(Staring at the Cauldron of the Divine Tree.) This is the Cauldron of the Divine Tree! Today is finally the day! Even though we three did many evil things, we are more loyal than the so-called righteous people. Since you got the Cauldron of the Divine Tree for us, we will return the favor and help you find the goods.
complete_42280=<s>You used such low manipulations. It's all your fault. Otherwise Xingxiu Sect would have become mine already.
complete_42494=<s>Not bad. You are looking for Dark Steel Ore?
complete_42504=<s>Hmm? It seems to be made of Dark Steel.
complete_42506=<s>What? She thinks Dark Steel Dagger is not good enough?
context_42242=<s>This is the jade pendant that the emperor secretly gave to the leader. It can be used to manage an army of fifty thousand soldiers. If things get serious, destroy Xingxiu Sect at all cost.
context_42243=<s>Go to Xingxiu Sect and investigate about the stolen goods. Let's see if Xingxiu Sect is willing to hand out the goods to avoid further trouble. Here is thirty thousand liang to fund this time. Be extra careful. Don't let others know our communication with the government.
context_42249=<s>We just saw a Xingxiu Disciple getting chased by some people. You can find him and ask for details.
context_42254=<s>It's the season when poison herbs in the Evil Men's Valley get ripe. Master sends many disciples down the mountain to collect the poison herbs. Xingxiu Sect has many disciples. Each has a token. With the token, one can enter Xingxiu Sect freely. Recently people inside Xingxiu Sect are getting suspicious. Anyone without a token will be killed. My token was stolen just now. It seems I can't go back now.
context_42259=<s>Be careful. Everyone in Xingxiu Sect is an expert in poisons. You need be extra careful. Otherwise it will be too late when you get poisoned.
context_42260=<s>I knew that these fools would mess up when stealing. The goods are in the secret room. Quickly take them and go back. Xingxiu Sect is going to have a huge change soon. Don't get too nosy.
context_42262=<s>Abbess Buji stole a lot of money again, and went killing people in Xingxiu Sect. We can make use of it. Tell Jiang Yici that our goal is Su Bailing too and that we can help him. Once his guards are down, we will have more freedom in Xingxiu Sect. We can find the opportunity to take back the goods and the Cauldron of the Divine Tree.
context_42263=<s>We just invented this poison. It's called Wind of Grievance. It can spread with wind. Anyone who inhales it will get numb and lose all power. Go to the highest place in Xingxiu Sect and use the poison. Keep in mind to not breathe the wind blowing your way for at least an hour.
context_42266=<s>As an evil person, of course I know what evil people think. He just wants to use us. After he's done, he will kill us. Just like... We would kill you when we get the Cauldron of the Divine Tree. Su Bailing is also evil. If we kill Jiang Yici for him, he will kill us too. We need to act based on the situation.
context_42267=It is a disastrous time for Xingxiu Sect recently. Jiang Yi is ambitious. He wants to be the head of Xingxiu Sect and destroy my sect. He also stole the Cauldron of the Divine Tree to cultivate the Energy-melting Skill. To cultivate the Energy-melting Skill, live humans are needed as cultivation objects. Recently many Xingxiu Disciples are missing. I guess he did that. I am at the bottleneck of cultivating my martial arts. Please go and help Xingxiu Sect. We will return the goods to you after.
context_42269=<s>The Cauldron of the Divine Tree has an Ice Toad sitting inside. The Ice Toad is extremely poisonous. Everyday it will give out extreme icy chi. People who cultivate the Energy-melting Skill can take in this chi and level up. But they will also get extremely cold. So they need some special things to defend themselves against the cold.
context_42277=<s>Evil people are evil people. Jiang Yici is not dead yet. He will not dare to do anything to you. Go back and tell him that as long as goods are not returned, the Cauldron of the Divine Tree will not be handed over. Then he will not dare to do anything to you.
context_42488=<s>There are still some days before the Divine Doctor Conference. I want to find someone to craft a good Dark Steel Dagger and give it to Miu Ying. I heard there is an exceptional blacksmith living here. But I don't know where he is. Can you help me to find him?
context_42493=<s>You want to craft a Dark Steel Dagger. What is in need the most?
context_42494=<s>I know that here lives a female swordsman with last name Tian. She cultivated over the years. It's said she has high quality Dark Steel.
menu_42248=I am here about the Xingxiu Sect's issue.
menu_42258=It seems I have to visit Xingxiu Sect again.
menu_42259=Xingxiu Sect is not a big deal for Royal Guard. Don't worry.
menu_42262=It has to be so. Get into Xingxiu Sect first.
menu_42493=Dark Steel is really rare.
target_42248=<s>Tell Abbess Buji that Xingxiu Sect stole government's item and that these three people want the Cauldron of the Divine Tree.
target_42249=<s>I went and rescued the Xingxiu Sect disciple where he was being chased for life. But he was badly injured.
target_42252=<s>Talk to Xue Muren to obtain the healing medicine Wujue Pill. Let the Xingxiu Sect disciple take it.
target_42253=<s>Ask Xingxiu Sect disciple about the Cauldron of the Divine Tree and the government item.
target_42254=<s>Kill Xingxiu Sect disciple to get the token. Then meet Xingxiu Sect guard disciple.
target_42255=<s>Duel with the guard disciple. Then go check the place mentioned by Xingxiu Sect disciple.
target_42256=<s>Defeat the guard disciple Ke Li. Then ask about Xingxiu Sect recent situations.
target_42258=<s>Go to Xingxiu Sect. You find Abbess Buji was attacked by Xingxiu Sect disciples. You tried to protect her but she was still injured and poisoned.
target_42263=<s>Go to Xingxiu Sect's highest point to use the poison. You got exposed by Xingxiu Sect disciple. Fight him and then report to Jiang Yici.
target_42267=<s>Talk to Xingxiu Sect disciple Jia Sheng and defeat him.
target_42272=<s>Talk to Abbess Buji. Then head to Xingxiu Sect and spread the rumor that Jiang Yici is dying. Then find Su Bailing.
target_42275=<s>Defeat and talk to Shangguan Lanjun to obtain the location of Cauldron of the Divine Tree. Get the Cauldron and give it to Abbess Buji.
target_42282=<s>Talk to Abbess Buji. Get Cauldron of the Divine Tree and hand it to Su Bailing. Get the government item and find Monk Bujie.
