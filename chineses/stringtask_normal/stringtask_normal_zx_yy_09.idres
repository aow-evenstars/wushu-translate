
CanAcceptMenu_22577=Do you know where they went? I want to go check it out.
CanAcceptMenu_22578=What else do you need?
CanAcceptMenu_22579=She chased them for a bit and overheard them talking about going to the Twelve-linked Fortress.
CanAcceptMenu_22580=I am just a passerby. I heard a lot of strange things have been happening near Twelve-linked Fortress recently. Is it true?
CanAcceptMenu_22581=What for?
CanAcceptMenu_22582=What should we do? What if those two green-clothed men bring trouble to Twelve-linked Fortress too?
CanAcceptMenu_22583=Anything else needs to be done?
CanAcceptMenu_22584=What does the Third Hall Leader like?
CanAcceptMenu_22585=How can I go to the Twelve-linked Fortress Main Helm?
CanAcceptMenu_22586=I need to ask the Helm Leader for a favor. Can you introduce me?
CanAcceptMenu_22587=How rude of me to make you wait. I am here to pay my respects.
CanAcceptMenu_22588=My martial arts are nothing compared to yours.
CanAcceptMenu_22589=Didn't the Helm Leader forbid the disciples from coming to the Snake Cave because of the King Snake appearances? Why are you here?
CanAcceptMenu_22590=Do you feel better?
CanAcceptMenu_22591=Is this the egg of that snake?
CanAcceptMenu_22592=Take this Snake Gall Bladder to the Helm Leader.
CanAcceptMenu_22593=Anything else?
CanAcceptMenu_22594=What are you up to?
CanAcceptMenu_22595=I am trying to find my past, but no one seems to know.
CanAcceptMenu_22596=What are your rules?
CanAcceptMenu_22597=Who were those people?
CanAcceptMenu_22598=Can you tell me about the Star Palace?
CanAcceptMenu_22599=Although vague, I still want to thank you for your information.
CanAcceptMenu_22600=Then do you know how to pick the Lingshe Fruit the right way?
CanAcceptMenu_22601=I chased two Green Clothes Guards all the way here to Twelve-linked Fortress. Have you seen them?
CanAcceptMenu_22602=Who are you guys? Why did you kill those people?
CanAcceptMenu_22603=Confess! What is the relation between the Lord Qin Residence and Twelve-linked Fortress?!
CanAcceptMenu_22604=Forget it then. I am done helping you.
CanAcceptMenu_22605=What  on Earth happened?
CanAcceptMenu_22606=Anything I can help with?
CanAcceptMenu_22607=Who is this expert that is spying on you guys in Twelve-linked Fortress?
CanAcceptMenu_22608=What to be scared of? You think I would be scared of you now that I mastered my martial arts?
CanAcceptMenu_22609=Then my goal is accomplished. Time to die, old man!
CanAcceptMenu_22624=Let me tell you the truth. Chou Baisui ordered me to come kill you guys, because he does not want to be controlled by the Silent Temple any longer.
CompleteMenu_22577=I have something to take care of at Twelve-linked Fortress. Goodbye.
CompleteMenu_22578=Xiaoyao said she saw the guards of Lord Qin Residence kill many martial artists.
CompleteMenu_22579=Is this the Twelve-linked Fortress?
CompleteMenu_22580=Is this the way how you treat everyone who comes here?
CompleteMenu_22581=Can you let me in?
CompleteMenu_22582=I got the Snake Gall Bladder.
CompleteMenu_22583=I got the Lingshe Grass.
CompleteMenu_22584=I also brought back this high-quality Daughter's Wine.
CompleteMenu_22585=Nothing much. I heard there are a lot of people with special talents in Twelve-linked Fortress, so I came to pay my respects.
CompleteMenu_22586=I always hear good things about you, so I came to pay my respects.
CompleteMenu_22587=How embarrassing. My martial arts are so unrefined.
CompleteMenu_22588=What's wrong?
CompleteMenu_22589=I got the Lingshe Grass. Quick and patch it to your wound.
CompleteMenu_22590=Why there are so many eggs here? Big too!
CompleteMenu_22591=This is the Snake Gall Bladder of that King Snake.
CompleteMenu_22592=This is the Snake Gall Bladder of that King Snake. That snake will not hurt anyone anymore.
CompleteMenu_22593=Long time no see. How are your wounds?
CompleteMenu_22594=I chased those Black Suit Assassins away.
CompleteMenu_22595=I always hear good things about you, so I came to pay my respects.
CompleteMenu_22596=Are you alright?
CompleteMenu_22597=Those troublemaking disciples got what they deserved.
CompleteMenu_22598=Is the Star Palace so terrifying that no one even dares to mention its name?
CompleteMenu_22599=Bai Xiaosheng told me you know how to pick the Lingshe Fruit from the Snake Cave?
CompleteMenu_22600=I got the Lingshe Fruit.
CompleteMenu_22601=So tired from all that chasing. I finally found you guys.
CompleteMenu_22602=You are very arrogant for an amateur!
CompleteMenu_22603=Such a pity we lost them. Do you know how they are related to the Twelve-linked Fortress?
CompleteMenu_22604=Who were those Mysterious People? Why did they ambush me?
CompleteMenu_22605=You want to kill me too now?
CompleteMenu_22606=We meet again. The Helm Leader told me to come discuss with you on how we are going to take care of those two Silent Temple followers.
CompleteMenu_22607=Remember now that your master Shi Huhu is nothing compared to me. Do not be arrogant with me anymore.
CompleteMenu_22608=Are you alright?
CompleteMenu_22609=The Old Man is dead and you are injured, so will you kill yourself or do I need to do it for you?
CompleteMenu_22624=I killed those spies of Silent Temple. From now on you guys are free from Silent Temple's control.
accept_22577_1=<s>I saw them riding away so I secretly followed them. I heard them talking about going to the Twelve-linked Fortress when I managed to get closer to them.
accept_22578_1=<s>A lot of suspicious Mysterious Men were looking this way when you went to the Lord Qin Residence. They are up to no good. Help me check it out.
accept_22579_1=<s>You should be more careful when you are dealing with the Lord Qin Residence then, because the Twelve-linked Fortress is not known to be good. You should be cautious even if Lord Qin respects you.
accept_22580_1=<s>A passerby like you should not get into Twelve-linked Fortress' business. Go now! I am in a bad mood, so if I see you again I will not be polite anymore.
accept_22581_1=You do not know my misery. Everyone bullies me in the fortress because I am young, and they always make me guard this door. Even though it is considered Twelve-linked Fortress here, it is very far from the Main Helm. I am lonely here and have nowhere to release my anger, so I put it out on the passersby.
accept_22582_1=<s>If that is the case then I have a plan to let you sneak into Twelve-linked Fortress.
accept_22583_1=Second Hall Leader Wan Feng loves snake fights. Lingshe Grass inside the Snake Cave is a must-have to prepare for a snake fight, but the Snake Cave is scary and has a lot of snakes. Not many can enter the Snake Cave, so if you can bring some Lingshe Grass to him he will be very happy.
accept_22584_1=<s>Third Hall Leader Zou Chengping is a wine addict, so he will be very happy if you can bring him some good wine. There is a drunkard in Canglang Pavilion who is always drinking. He is always drunk but he has good wine. Ask him for some.
accept_22585_1=<s>Go take a boat over there and be on your way. Safe travels. If someone tries to stop you just tell them my name and that I recommended you to go see the Hall Leader.
accept_22586_1=<s>That is easy. Follow this disciple of mine and he will take you to the Helm Leader.
accept_22587_1=I am here at Twelve-linked Fortress but I have heard about you a long time ago. You must be a very talented martial artist. These are my Personal Bodyguards. Please teach them a thing or two and let me enjoy the show.
accept_22588_1=Not only are your kung fu great, but also you are polite. I am so happy that I am lucky enough to be your friend. You are destined to do great things. I need to ask you for a favor. The King Snake inside the Snake Cave was getting restless recently and injured many disciples. Can you help me take care of it and bring back the Snake Gall Bladder?
accept_22589_1=I heard the Helm Leader have been talking about the Snake Gall Bladder, so I came to get it to please my master. Who knows I will get bitten before I even find the King Snake. Can you help me get some Lingshe Grass? The grass is used for snake fights, but it can also counter snake venom.
accept_22590_1=<s>I feel much better. What are you doing here in this dangerous place?
accept_22591_1=A nest of eggs.
accept_22592_1=No way! You risked your life for this Snake Gall Bladder, so how can I steal the fruit of your labor? Take it back. I am heading back. Walk with me, because I am afraid there will be more snakes.
accept_22593_1=About this… I also admire you, but...
accept_22594_1=<s>I am confused too. After I returned to the fortress I found everyone being so secretive. I just came back so I do not know what happened. I just chased three Mysterious Men down here, but I saw them enter the house. Help me check it out.
accept_22595_1=<s>You should go ask Bai Xiaosheng. It is rumored he knows anything about everything. You are in luck because he is here right now.
accept_22596_1=<s>Everyone knows one answer from me means one favor from you. Ask me a question then you will owe me a favor.
accept_22597_1=They are the killers of Silent Temple and they have already tried to assassinate me many times before. This answer is free considering you just helped me.
accept_22598_1=I heard about the Star Palace when I stayed at Lingxiao Palace a while back. Everyone who lives there is a descendent of the Snow Mountain.
accept_22599_1=<s>Listen to me and leave Twelve-linked Fortress. This is not the place it once was.
accept_22600_1=<s>You asked the right person. Lingshe Fruit grows at a place surrounded by poisonous air that is very deadly. All the martial artists who went for the fruit died, and all the Snake Farmers who know how to deal with this poisonous air died to the snakes there because they do not know any martial arts. That is why the Lingshe Fruit is very hard to get. If you believe in your martial arts then take this Poison Avoiding Pill and go.
accept_22601_1=<s>Green Clothes Guards? Are they those secretive green-clothed men who came here at night couple of days ago? They are in the house behind.
accept_22602_1=<s>There is no need to answer a dead man. I told that stubborn Chou Baisui to take care of you a long time ago. How kind he was that he spared you.
accept_22603_1=<s>Let's kill him!
accept_22604_1=<s>This was your choice.
accept_22605_1=You do not know my story. I worked for the government. During that time the current Emperor was just taking his throne and I was expelled and almost killed. Because the new king needed new allies. Silent Temple saved me.
accept_22606_1=I wanted to escape from Silent Temple's control long ago, but was unable to because of those spies who live here. If you can help me take care of those two Silent Temple spies, then I will return Twelve-linked Fortress to its former glory. Take this pill made from that King Snake's Gall Bladder. It will make you strong. Then you can go discuss with Jian Jiutian on how to defeat those spies.
accept_22607_1=Those two spies are the Northern Double Vultures Shi Huhu and Old Man. They are known for using dirty moves involving poison. That pill you took will make you immune to the most of poisons.
accept_22608_1=<s>Wait here! I will go get my master. Then we will see if you can still be so arrogant.
accept_22609_1=<s>Who are you? You are not a disciple of Twelve-linked Fortress?
accept_22624_1=<s>We already know of that old fox's plan, but we did not know he would act so soon!
complete_22577=Wait. I need another favor.
complete_22578=I see.
complete_22579=Who are you? What are you doing here?
complete_22580=<s>I am in a foul mood. How unlucky for you.
complete_22581=<s>Sorry, it is the Fortress Leader's order that no strangers can enter the Twelve-linked Fortress these couple of days.
complete_22582=<s>Now that the First Hall Leader is happy, he will not expel you anymore.
complete_22583=Now the Second Hall Leader is also taken care of.
complete_22584=<s>Now no one will stop you from entering Twelve-linked Fortress.
complete_22585=<s>Of course. We have a lot of talented people here at Twelve-linked Fortress, and there are many things they can do. You made the right decision to come here.
complete_22586=<s>You are too modest. The Hall Leader just sent some people over to tell me you were coming. Nice to meet you.
complete_22587=Do not be so modest. You are very talented.
complete_22588=<s>I… I got bitten by a snake.
complete_22589=<s>Thank you so much. If it has not been for you, I would be dead.
complete_22590=<s>A Nest of Eggs.
complete_22591=<s>You must be great at martial arts. So many people were eaten by that snake, and yet you survived and killed it.
complete_22592=<s>Thank you for removing the vermin of Twelve-linked Fortress. From now on the disciples can be safe when they are collecting herbs in the Snake Cave.
complete_22593=<s>Thanks to you my wounds are not a problem anymore.
complete_22594=<s>Looks like something bad is about to happen. Be careful while you are in the fortress.
complete_22595=I know you are here for something. Before you ask me your questions you need to know my rules first.
complete_22596=<s>Thank you. Those people are so vicious. If not for you, I would not be able to see tomorrow's sun.
complete_22597=So efficient you are.
complete_22598=<s>You should stop asking about the Star Palace. You will regret it if you learn the truth.
complete_22599=<s>Of course. I hunted snakes for years and know every kind of snakes.
complete_22600=<s>This is it. I told so many people to go, but none of them ever returned.
complete_22601=<s>I have been watching you, fledgling. How dare you come to me before I go to you!?
complete_22602=<s>You should know what is good for you. We are just minions, but if you anger my boss then your good days will be over.
complete_22603=<s>Did you forget my rules?
complete_22604=You must excuse me. Those people do not work for me. It is… A long story.
complete_22605=Let me tell you the rest of the story. It is not until later did I learn that Silent Temple are evildoers. I do not agree with their actions but there was nothing I could do while I was under their control. They just told me to kill you, but you look like a good person so I will not do it.
complete_22606=<s>The Helm Leader always wanted to be free of Silent Temple's control so he would not be forced to do anymore evil, but we lacked help from someone who was skilled in martial arts. It is great that you are here now.
complete_22607=<s>How dare you come ask for trouble just because you are a talented fighter!?
complete_22608=<s>What a surprise that Shi Huhu also made this much progress in the martial arts. Looks like I need to rest for a couple of days, but Shi Huhu's condition is not much better compared to me either. Hmph!
complete_22609=<s>You think too little of me. Do not compare that Old Man to me. If it was not for you, he would be dead.
complete_22624=<s>Thank you very much for your help.
context_22577=I saw them riding away so I secretly followed them. I heard them talking about going to the Twelve-linked Fortress when I managed to get closer to them.

menu_22590_1=The Helm Leader told me to come kill the King Snake.
