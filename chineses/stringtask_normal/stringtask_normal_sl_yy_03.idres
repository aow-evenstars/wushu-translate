CanAcceptMenu_80720=Assassinate the group
accept_80704_1=Ming Yueshang was originally the vice leader of the branch. We were on par with Foreign Warriors, but because of his betrayal, this place has fallen to such a state. Help me get revenge on him!
accept_80720_1=At night, there will be a group of black-clad people assembled on the front post. You go and see what they are doing. My guess is that they are a group of killers. If it's true, bring some evidence.
complete_80714=Thank you, this is indeed my letter. It seems to have been sent a long time ago, and the person who sent it should have been killed.
context_80708=It turns out that the couple are the Martial Masters of Wulin, who just don't want to be involved with Jianghu anymore and are living in seclusion. The swordsman sent by the Silent Temple was a killer who sought revenge on the couple.
