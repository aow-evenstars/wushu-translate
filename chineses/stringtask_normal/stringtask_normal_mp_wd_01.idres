accept_36002_1=I have never thought that I would be hurt for this unknown stuff.
accept_36003_1=Yao Bing knows much of these things; once a disciple of Thunderbolt Hall, he departed in acrimony and joined Wudang. You will find him near Imperial Sword Stele.
accept_36005_1=This is important, it seems there may be a plot to disrupt our ceremony! Inform Master Huo Tianxing and ask him to make a decision.
accept_36019_1=<s>If you do not help me, I will get punished for losing the heirloom.
accept_36020_1=I think you Wudang are too well-fed - it clouds your perception! How could you not recognize me, Qiu Yidao, of the Delightful Forest?
accept_36027_1=Speak to Ma Xiao; he stands in penance, over there.
accept_36031_1=You should ask Immortal Kongkong.
accept_36042_1=You are very brave; you helped us avoid disaster.
complete_36002_1=So strange… Why does it have the smell of saltpeter and sulphur?
complete_36004=What did Yao Bing say?
complete_36005=It is a shame Wudang is threatened as we prepare for our ceremony. How do we investigate with such a small clue?
complete_36013=Sheath your sword. Let us talk.
complete_36016=These strangers robbed me. Will you help me?
complete_36017=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >  </font>
complete_36018=I did not expect you to see through me. Confound my useless cronies.
complete_36019=I never expected you to be such a fool!
complete_36020=Everyone at the ceremony will die and Wudang will be blamed.
complete_36021=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">Here, take the antidote.</font>
complete_36026=What happened at the foot of the mountain? How did you fall foul of the Delightful Forest's poison?
complete_36027=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Don't fill in.</font>
complete_36028=
complete_36029=What? What is this word? I've never seen it before. But I have very little learning…
complete_36031=What is this chaos beneath the mountain, that seeks to find its way to the top? Tell me everything.
complete_36037=We've checked the Heaven Burst Pellets in each of the four halls, except Nanyan Palace. It's where disciples go to rest. It is remote and rarely visited by anyone.
complete_36038=What can I do for you?
complete_36038_1=Of course, It's the preface of the Tao Te Ching. It says that you can observe wonder if you have no will. Otherwise, you only see mere substance. Yet these two things are both magical! Younger Martial Brother, you must study more.
complete_36039=
complete_36039_1=
complete_36040=Our enemy's plans are elaborate. We must be on our guard.
complete_36040_1=Know that that snake has been cultivating its' venom for many years. Learn from this but do not dwell on your mistakes.
complete_36041=You dealt with this thing correctly. Though it strived for victory in the danger, it was a good idea. Well done.
complete_36042=Ah, my most modest Disciple. We have passed the most recent crisis, but we must be alert to new plots.
context_36002=I have never thought that I would be hurt for this unknown stuff.
context_36003=I think of a person. He was a disciple of Thunderbolt Hall. But he was angry with what Thunderbolt Hall had done. So he joined Wudang. Now he is cultivating on the mountain. Maybe he knows what this is. You go to find him near Imperial Sword Stele. He is Yao Bing.
context_36004=It's powerful. If it is used by someone, I'm afraid we will be face with a great calamity. It is an important thing. We can not deal with it hastily. Now we must investigate it carefully.
context_36005=Inform my master Huo Tianxing and have him make a quick decision about what to do.
context_36016=That noise was made by party guests. They said they'd kill me if I tried to intervene.
context_36017=Some people stole my jade heirloom. Will you help me get it back?
context_36018=Please help me get my family's jade plate back!
context_36019=<s>If you do not help me, I will get punished for losing the heirloom.
context_36020=<s>Wudang only has futile disciples. Maybe you don't know that they are my disciples from Merry Land, but you still don't recognize me, so I can't stop laughing. Ha-ha! You are not worth the air you breath, I want your life as a blood sacrifice to my blade!
context_36021=But what can you do? You're already dead and Wudang is doomed to ill-fame. Now, I have some work to do.
context_36026=You were only poisoned slightly; I suppressed the toxicity with my chi. Take the medicine and you will soon be well again.
context_36027=I punished Ma Xiao and made him sit against the wall to think about what he did. How did he get out? Go have a look.
context_36028=Are you going to deal with the men from Delightful Forest? But these men have already mixed into our Wudang Disciples. According to my conjecture, they are in this yard. It would be well if you use my method to have a try.
context_36029=<s>I Have never thought the rascals of the Delightful Forest hide themselves so well. If we just let them go, we will never find out the mole. So we cannot let them run away.
context_36031=<s>You should ask Immortal Kongkong.
context_36037=I have studied for many years, but I have never seen this character before. Perhaps it is a riddle… Elder Taoist Cang Wu has an affinity for solving riddles, speak with him.
context_36038=<s>Nanyan Palace is a lonely dwelling. It may have been easier for the moles to sneak in. Tread carefully, and watch out!
context_36039=I've been Wudang for many years and have read classics like the Tao Te Ching more than one hundred times. If you have any questions, I can help you.
context_36039_1=I'm looking after it for someone else. I can not tamper with things that are not mine. Please, do not press me on this matter.
context_36040=<s>This man seems suspicious. I'd better report this to the headmaster.
context_36041=<s>The Taoist talks vaguely and these Packages extremely resemble Heaven Burst Pellets. To avoid new problems cropping up unexpectedly, you should subdue him first and send him to the Headmaster, who will provide a final judge.
context_36042=You are very brave; you helped us avoid disaster.
menu_36001_1=I got it.
menu_36002_1=Sorry, but such things happen in Wudang.
menu_36003_1=I will go to Elder Brother Yao Bing to inquire.
