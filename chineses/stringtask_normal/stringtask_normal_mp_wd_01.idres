accept_36002_1=I have never thought that I would be hurt for this unknown stuff.
accept_36003_1=Yao Bing knows much of these things; once a disciple of Thunderbolt Hall, he departed in acrimony and joined Wudang. You will find him near Imperial Sword Stele.
accept_36005_1=This is important, it seems there may be a plot to disrupt our ceremony! Inform Master Huo Tianxing and ask him to make a decision.
accept_36019_1=<s>If you do not help me, I will get punished for losing the heirloom.
accept_36020_1=I think you Wudang are too well-fed - it clouds your perception! How could you not recognize me, Qiu Yidao, of the Delightful Forest?
accept_36031_1=You should ask Immortal Kongkong.
accept_36042_1=You are very brave; you helped us avoid disaster.
complete_36002_1=So strange… Why does it have the smell of saltpeter and sulphur?
complete_36004=What did Yao Bing say?
complete_36005=It is a shame Wudang is threatened as we prepare for our ceremony. How do we investigate with such a small clue?
complete_36013=Sheath your sword. Let us talk.
complete_36016=These strangers robbed me. Will you help me?
complete_36017=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > </font>
complete_36018=I did not expect you to see through me. Confound my useless cronies.
complete_36019=I never expected you to be such a fool!
complete_36020=Everyone at the ceremony will die and Wudang will be blamed.
complete_36021=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">Here, take the antidote.</font>
complete_36026=What happened at the foot of the mountain? How did you fall foul of the Delightful Forest's poison?
complete_36027=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Don't fill in.</font>
complete_36028=
complete_36029=What? What is this word? I've never seen it before. But I have very little learning…
complete_36031=What is this chaos beneath the mountain, that seeks to find its way to the top? Tell me everything.
complete_36037=We've checked the Heaven Burst Pellets in each of the four halls, except Nanyan Palace. It's where disciples go to rest. It is remote and rarely visited by anyone.
complete_36038=What can I do for you?
complete_36038_1=Of course, It's the preface of the Tao Te Ching. It says that you can observe wonder if you have no will. Otherwise, you only see mere substance. Yet these two things are both magical! Younger Martial Brother, you must study more.
complete_36039=
complete_36039_1=
complete_36040=Our enemy's plans are elaborate. We must be on our guard.
complete_36040_1=Know that that snake has been cultivating its' venom for many years. Learn from this but do not dwell on your mistakes.
complete_36041=You dealt with this thing correctly. Though it strived for victory in the danger, it was a good idea. Well done.
complete_36042=Ah, my most modest Disciple. We have passed the most recent crisis, but we must be alert to new plots.
context_36002=I have never thought that I would be hurt for this unknown stuff.
context_36003=I think of a person. He was a disciple of Thunderbolt Hall. But he was angry with what Thunderbolt Hall had done. So he joined Wudang. Now he is cultivating on the mountain. Maybe he knows what this is. You go to find him near Imperial Sword Stele. He is Yao Bing.
context_36004=It's powerful. If it is used by someone, I'm afraid we will be face with a great calamity. It is an important thing. We can not deal with it hastily. Now we must investigate it carefully.
context_36005=Inform my master Huo Tianxing and have him make a quick decision about what to do.
context_36016=That noise was made by party guests. They said they'd kill me if I tried to intervene.
context_36017=Some people stole my jade heirloom. Will you help me get it back?
context_36018=Please help me get my family's jade plate back!
context_36019=<s>If you do not help me, I will get punished for losing the heirloom.
context_36020=<s>Wudang only has futile disciples. Maybe you don't know that they are my disciples from Merry Land, but you still don't recognize me, so I can't stop laughing. Ha-ha! You are not worth the air you breath, I want your life as a blood sacrifice to my blade!
context_36021=But what can you do? You're already dead and Wudang is doomed to ill-fame. Now, I have some work to do.
context_36026=You were only poisoned slightly; I suppressed the toxicity with my chi. Take the medicine and you will soon be well again.
context_36028=Are you going to deal with the men from Delightful Forest? But these men have already mixed into our Wudang Disciples. According to my conjecture, they are in this yard. It would be well if you use my method to have a try.
context_36029=<s>I Have never thought the rascals of the Delightful Forest hide themselves so well. If we just let them go, we will never find out the mole. So we cannot let them run away.
context_36031=<s>You should ask Immortal Kongkong.
context_36037=I have studied for many years, but I have never seen this character before. Perhaps it is a riddle… Elder Taoist Cang Wu has an affinity for solving riddles, speak with him.
context_36038=<s>Nanyan Palace is a lonely dwelling. It may have been easier for the moles to sneak in. Tread carefully, and watch out!
context_36039=I've been Wudang for many years and have read classics like the Tao Te Ching more than one hundred times. If you have any questions, I can help you.
context_36039_1=I'm looking after it for someone else. I can not tamper with things that are not mine. Please, do not press me on this matter.
context_36040=<s>This man seems suspicious. I'd better report this to the headmaster.
context_36041=<s>The Taoist talks vaguely and these Packages extremely resemble Heaven Burst Pellets. To avoid new problems cropping up unexpectedly, you should subdue him first and send him to the Headmaster, who will provide a final judge.
context_36042=You are very brave; you helped us avoid disaster.

complete_36066=<s>Hmph, Sword Clan is really bullying people too much! Not only did they injure Chi Clan disciples, but they also threatened to seek revenge on our clan! We have not yet sought revenge on them and we have already backed off. I didn't think they would be aggressive now. What an outrage!

complete_36191=<s>I never thought it would be like this. Now I also have no ideas of revenge. The retribution is done...
complete_36212=<s>Wonderer's Valley disciples have a history of going back on their words. Don't trust them. It's just that we monks should not kill and maim too much.
complete_36393=<s>The master has been killed. The young hero went to revenge. Go and persuade her not to be so impetuous.
context_36027=I punished Ma Xiao and made him sit against the wall to think about what he did. How did he get out? Go have a look.
context_36173=I will become a burden to her even if I go to see her. Please give this sword and the letter to her, so that she can take revenge for her father! Please, Master! Master!
context_36175=Why should it be this way? I must go and kill that bastard to take revenge for my father! Why are you stopping me? Shouldn't I be doing that?
context_36212=<s>It turns out that Liu Changchun went to another Wanderer's Valley disciple, Xia Sha, to discuss revenge. Report the matter to Nine Crane Taoist and ask him to make a decision.
context_36213=<s>Wanderer's Valley wants to take revenge on Mount Song and we can't just sit back and do nothing about it. In my opinion, it is better to destroy it secretly. Go and catch Xia Sha alive, don't let him escape.
context_36251=<s>If anything happens to Yanxin, I will feel guilty for the rest of my life. Go to Yellow Plains and persuade Hongyan to put the matter of revenge on hold. I'm going to say goodbye to Zi Yang, and I'll be there soon.
context_36252=<s>You get out of the way quickly. Don't interfere with my revenge for my brother, don't force my hand.
context_36262=<s>It seems too quiet around here. It's not quite right. The old thief must have deceived me and sent a killers to attack. We should be careful.
context_36389=<s>Royal Guards are going around crushing the Jianghu factions and growing in strength. Royal Guards will take over the eight factions. Those who have not surrendered will be killed eventually.
context_36395=<s>Don't stop me! I will find Royal Guards and those evil thieves and kill them to revenge my father.
context_36397=<s>Please help me avenge. I heard their next goal is Ancient Tomb Sect. Please stop them.
context_36413=<s>No, I want revenge for my father. Also I have a solution for Beggar's Sect lack of food and weapons. This is my Heirloom Jade Pendant, it's worth a lot of money. If you take it to the wealthy people in Yanjing, they should be willing to trade it for rice. Have them deliver the rice to Beggar's Sect and we are all good.
context_36417=<s>There are too many Royal Guards. There's a saying that you have to start with the leader. You should find a way to infiltrate the camp of the Royal Guards and find a way to assault the leader to disrupt their army. We can then attack with full force.
context_36424=<s>The terrain is treacherous. If you want to hit the Royal Guards hard, you have to do the unexpected. I have discussed with Elder Shi about the tremendous lethality of stone throwing attacks, and this is where it comes in handy. But in order to surprise the Royal Guards, you must first eliminate the surrounding Royal Guards. Then you can get rid of them all.
context_36512=<s>In my opinion, although these disciples are not as good as your martial arts, they are well-trained. It can be said that they are specially trained for covert attacks. Fifth and Sixth Martial Uncle went to scout for information. You'd better go see them. The opponent is not to be underestimated.
menu_36286=Do not underestimate them. The leader of these people is a Wudang Traitor and the enemy of Sister Hong!
