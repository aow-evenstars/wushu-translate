accept_11921_1=What's wrong with you? Why did you faint so suddenly?
accept_11921_2=Come on. Have some food and drinks to recover your strength. You don't look like a native, are you one?
accept_11921_3=It just so happens that I'm the Private Adviser of the Magistrate of Suzhou but I have only one attendant. If you will, you can follow me to serve the Magistrate with an accomodation offering, thus you can save some money.
accept_11921_4=Don't thank me so early. Go to thank my Lord, the Magistrate named Kuang Zhong. He has just assumed office but not for long.
accept_11922_1=Find the manager, Meng and bring the food back to the master.
accept_11922_2=My Lord hasn't had a good meal since taking office. No more asking. Just go to the reataurant and tell Manager Meng about this.
accept_11923_1=Here, you came back.
accept_11923_2=Bastard, what did you say?
accept_11923_3=I told you I have one meat dish and one vegetable dish. Why don't you listen to me?
accept_11923_4=Is the stewed bean curd with green vegetable not edible? Not Nutritional? Do you know that many of the people in Suzhou can't even afford this? How could they live? As long as there's one family of Suzhou that does not eat or live well during my term of office, it's my fault. The royal graciousness is infinite worldwide, and I can't return the trust of the King with me alone.
accept_11923_5=Remember this saying "Simple for explicating one’s ambition, quiet to go far." Now that you're an official, act as an offcial and never seek private gain through your power…Thank you for your kind heart but I'm afraid I cannot accept this food. Please pack and send them to the Xuanmiao Temple. Find the leader there and give the food to the scholars, who are hard working everyday and need Nutrition. Please go.
accept_11923_6=Pay the manager for the food and take the rest with you.
accept_11924_1=Go to the Pine and Crane Tower with me. As usual, the new official should meet the big families and some eunuches.
accept_11924_2=He-he-he, you know, the King likes rare treasures and sends the Eunuches to look for them everywhere. The Ehnuches take direct orders from the King, so they are disobedient and even beat local offcials. Therefore, it becames an unwritten rule for new offcials, hoping to get along with the old Eunuches in harmony.
accept_11924_3=Thanks to the grace of his Majesty to offer me the "Command Paper". The Eunuches cannot do harm to me, but on the contrary, I'd like to take this opportunity to sort out these unwritten rules. Let's go now.
accept_11925_1=(Reading the memorial I can't help but laugh) ha-ha-ha-ha...
accept_11925_2=Finally my sixth memorial moved the emperor and he issued an exemption of a portion of my grain tax. I couldn't be happier.
accept_11925_3=Who is  offering these poems?
accept_11925_4=Zou Liang, is a very promising youth. I will recommend him to be an official and he will achieve something great in the future.
accept_11925_5=Damn. These Eunuches are defying me. Come on. Go to the Pine and Crane Tower with me.
accept_11925_6=Registrar Wu was slapped in the face by a new Eunuch before the crowd, and I'd like to ask the old Eunuch how he ruled his subordinates.
accept_11926_1=Why, catching crickets could be deadly. I feel so terrible.
accept_11926_2=Talking like that will get you killed!
accept_11926_3=Credit for the country's prosperity  should be given to the management of the emperor. As officials, we can only hope to sway the emperor in beneficial ways.
accept_11926_4=Usually Head Constable Xu works very careful but after this time, this good man vanishes.
accept_11926_5=There're 10 pieces left. So?
accept_11926_6=It's okay. Go now and be back soon.
accept_11927_1=I haven't eaten in days. Have mercy on me.
accept_11927_2=It's been several days since I ate. Good man, please give me something to eat…I, I'm starting to ...faint.
accept_11928_1=One good deed deserves another. There are some more fellow refugees of mine who are starving to death now. Would you give me some more for them?
accept_11928_2=Sobbing……
accept_11928_3=We were Villagers of the northern Village and we then moved in with an offcial relative in Suzhou for shelter bacause of starvation. The goods and money we had were stolent from us at Campanula Valley, the two that were with us were killed and some women were taken by the bandits. The remainder of us escaped but three were lost, and now Xu Erhu, Hu Darui, and me are here.
accept_11928_4=Give me some more steamed buns to take home, and we shall pray for you everyday.
accept_11929_1=Warrior.
accept_11929_2=Warrior.
accept_11929_3=Bandits captured my sister and niece, and killed my brother-in-law. My niece, Xiao Cui, was sold into servitude to a rich family. Please help her escape. She must be so frightened!
accept_11929_4=Yes, yes, I heard that they lived in some place like Miao Temple.
accept_11930_1=You can just tell us. I will enforce the laws impartially.
accept_11930_2=These things happen. Guys, go to Xuanmiao Temple quickly. Take him there and question him.
accept_11930_3=This is all my fault!
accept_11931_1=Would you do me another favor?
accept_11931_2=My request is simple. The Bandit Chief took everyone I love. Help me take his head, and I'll pay..
accept_11931_3=Thank you very much for your great kindness. I would do anything to return the favor in my next life.
accept_11932_1=Are you familiar with Suzhou?
accept_11932_2=Have you heard of Yang Tao? He's the relative who I'm going to seek refuge with.
accept_11932_3=I'm not sure, and I only know it's a distant relative.
accept_11932_4=Hey, I'll beg along the way and ask also.
accept_11933_1=Your advice was taken and I'm going home. Before I leave, I want to you to do me a favor. Would you?
accept_11933_2=You've helped me a lot but I have nothing to return. Since you're occupied, it would be bad to ask for your help. Please go handle your business now.
accept_11933_3=Many people in Suzhou helped me. I'd like to bid farewell to them before leaving, and pay the money I owe back to them.
accept_11933_4=Li Guangtian, boss of Sihai Groceries, helped me when I was starving; Du Bainian, boss of the Revival Herbal Hall, cured my disease for free; Wei Cui, the embroidery lady, wasn't sick of me and sent me a set of clothes; Zhu Wang, the shopboy, once stole some food from the kitchen for me.
accept_11933_5=I have 4 packages here. Please present these to them for me.
accept_11933_6=There's something you don't know. Don't unpack the bag. Just give it to them.
accept_11934_1=Wait, please take this.
accept_11934_2=This kung fu book belonged to my father. I don't study kung fu so you should have it.
accept_11934_3=Hundreds of people pass me each day without another glance. But not you. Selfless acts should be rewarded.
accept_11935_1=Ha-ha-ha, your Flying Skills are so strange. You've been exerting your strength for a long time, but you cannot leap onto roofs or vault over walls.
accept_11935_2=I think your groundwork is so-so, but you're very industrious. As the saying goes, "diligence can make up for lack of intelligence". As long as you insist on practicing everyday, you will succeed. Go find Lin Tiannan in the City, a friend of mine. Mention my name to him and perhaps he will give you some advice.
accept_11935_3=I've been living here in seclusion for a long time, and only heard that he would come to Suzhou for something. You can mention me before him freely now.
accept_11936_1=Since you were introduced by the Taoist Priest, I'll give you some advice. However, you should do some things for me.
accept_11936_2=Please ask my four friends to visit me in the Suzhou Pine and Crane Restaurant the day after tomorrow. I have something important to tell them.
accept_11936_3=Reaching the Four Experts will be an ordeal. I won't look down on you if you give up.
accept_11937_1=Those who knew me said I was sad. Those who did not know me said I was seeking something.
accept_11944_1=
accept_11946_1=Excuse me, sir, have you met Mr. Ke in Yanyu Villa?
accept_11948_1=You want to find Young Master Ke? I will send you a message by carrier pigeon when I find out more.
accept_11949_1=You don't look like a businessperson. What can I do for you?
accept_11950_1=About this Ms. Lu you mentioned...
accept_11952_1=My leg was injured by a stone, then I lost consciousness!
accept_11954_1=If I hadn't gotten involved, I wouldn't have lost the medical herb and could have cured Ms. Lu.
accept_11955_1=Have you escorted all of the kids back?
accept_11956_1=Miss Lu didn't receive timely treatment. It's my fault.
accept_11957_1=Wait a minute, I have a bottle of Medicinal Liquor. Please save them and feed them a little of this.
accept_11958_1=By the way, you mustn't mention this matter to Xiaer - let her be with me happily.
complete_11904=<s>It's true that time makes it inevitable in every profession, that young men replace the old men. The subordinates of the Secret Association were killed by you so easily. You will succeed in the future. Come on, I will give you something that may be useful to you one day.
complete_11909=<s>This package is for my apologies to you.
complete_11912=<s>Thanks for your help, I am able to destroy this evil sword. Here's a package for you, I hope you will accept it.
complete_11913=<s>Thank you very much. This is a gift for you, and I hope you will take it.
complete_11921=Our Master is kind-hearted, and I think he has agreed to accept you, hasn't he?
complete_11922=Here, you came back. Put the food on the table and ask my Lord to eat the meals.
complete_11927=Steamed, Steamed Stuffed Buns, I'm so hungry…
complete_11928=One day I will return the favor.
complete_11929=The man coming to the Hall, who are you? Do you have any grievance to appeal?
complete_11930=Thank you very much. You've helped me a lot but I have nothing to pay you back with.
complete_11931=It's him. I wanna offer his head to sacrifice the ghosts killed by him.
complete_11932=Do you have any news regarding Yang Tao?
complete_11932_1=How could it be so?!
complete_11933=You're my benefactor. Thank you very much. I've settled everything and will go home safely.
complete_11934=You have passed my tests. Here is a script. Use it well.
complete_11935=It's him. Long time no see. Where's he now?
complete_11936=Here, you came back.
complete_11936_1=Ha-ha-ha, good, good. Your Flying Skills are pretty good now. I don't need to instruct you any more.
complete_11936_2=You have been practicing your Flying Skills and visiting the Four Experts, but your abilities have not yet improved. Remember that focusing on one thing makes for a narrow mind. Explore! Swim! Climb! All things will come to you in time.
complete_11936_3=Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, it doesn't matter. Keep it in mind and you'll understand one day. I have something for you and it will help you understand through meditation.
complete_11937=
complete_11944=I heard that you were fearless in the face of danger, brave in fighting, and arrested the criminals wanted by the offcials?

complete_11947_2=He said his master is Ms. Lu.
complete_11948=Do you need our help?
complete_11951=Don't make any more effort, this pile of disordered stone is going to collapse.
complete_11952_1=Did the mission go smoothly?
complete_11952_2=Please spare my life. A strange middle-aged man sent us the box, and paid us to not open it. We don't know what's inside.
complete_11952_3=That escort was taken here by the middle aged man. And they required that this escort should be followed with Wu Rui. We can only allow them as we are also working for others while we receive money from them.
complete_11953=There is a herb here, and I have got one, but…
complete_11954=You can't let those beasts live.
complete_11955=Gosh… How pitiful fate can be!
complete_11956=You go ahead. I'll catch up later.
complete_11957=Thanks for your kindness, but I want to be with Xia Er and live a simple life for my last three months.

context_11910=<s>Usually the Wooden Knocker of a secular disciple is carved with the word "Wan".
context_11911=<s>There's a poisonous pond in the suburbs of Suzhou and there are no living beings that are alive in the surrounding area. The elders say that there are treasures under the pond but people who descend don't come up, why it's called "Man-Eating Pond". Now the Snake Skin clothes are perfect for going down to see the truth.

menu_11923_6=Yes, my lord…
menu_11924_1=My Lord, I understand the meaning of visiting an influential family, but isn't it right that Eunuchs are in the Palace only?
menu_11924_2=These Eunuches are too arrogant. Your Honor, will you…

menu_11925_1=My Lord, what makes you so happy?

menu_11925_5=What's wrong, my lord?
menu_11925_6=Yes
menu_11926_1=My Lord, are you still thinking of Xu Qi? It's not your fault. It was the old King who insisted on catching crickets.
menu_11926_2=Lord…my Lord, it's my fault…
menu_11926_3=I think that the death of Xu Chi is an injustice. He exchanged a bellicose cricket for a fine horse with good intentions. His wife was curious about the cricket and had a look at it, but she set it free. Being afraid of the Constable Xu's actions, she hung herself and died. What's worse, Xu Chi took it too hard and committed suicide also, because he feared that the Yamen might punish him for not handing in the cricket.
menu_11926_4=My Lord, restrain your grief. Head Constable Xu won't feel lonely because he has wives underground to be with him. However, how many more crickets does the Yamen need?
menu_11926_5=My Lord, it's easy. We have been catching crickets in the field since childhood. Shall I go the suburb field to catch some for you?
menu_11926_6=Yes, my lord.
menu_11927_1=What's wrong?
menu_11927_2=Wait for a moment, I'm going to get two Steamed Stuffed Buns for you.
menu_11928_1=Why, I always thought Suzhou was rich in resources and the people were well-off! It's only now I see that there are poor people like you who cannot even afford to eat.
menu_11928_2=No, no, young boy, men only shed tears when deeply hurt. I don't mean to look down upon you. Why are you crying?
menu_11928_3=Damn, I thought Suzhou was living in peace and tranquility. Such a tragedy has surprised me greatly.
menu_11928_4=of course you can have some Steamed Bread! One moment.
menu_11929_1=Why didn't you go? Isn't your relative waiting for the Steamed Buns?
menu_11929_2=Tell me what happened and I'll see if I can help.
menu_11929_3=Taoist? I'm afraid all the Taoists from Suzhou are from the Xuanmiao Temple.
menu_11929_4=I'm going to check, and if it's true, I will kill that bastard.
menu_11930_1=Di Ren is a human trafficker. I've tied him to a tree, and left evidence on his body. Please send someone to arrest him.

menu_11931_1=Why are you kneeling down? Stand up please. What's the matter?
menu_11931_2=Eh…okay. The Bandit Head has killed numerous people, and if I kill him, I will be removing his evil from the people.
menu_11931_3=It's my pleasure.
menu_11932_1=How are you?
menu_11932_2=Yang Tao? I've never heard that name. What kind of official is he?
menu_11932_3=Suzhou is so large and you're unfamiliar with it. How could you find him?
menu_11932_4=When will you find him? Okay, well I have many friends in Suzhou and I'll ask them for you.
menu_11933_1=Um……
