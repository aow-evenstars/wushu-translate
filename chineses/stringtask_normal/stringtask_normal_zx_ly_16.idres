accept_26721_1=I don't know, but Corpse Emissary said that you should go to visit her first after coming back.
accept_26722_1=I don't where is the Valley Leader, and he may have come back, but the madam knows that you have gone to Wudang and asked you to meet her first when you come back.
accept_26723_1=This...(grieve alone)...
accept_26724_1=Xiang Jiuchen, I must beat him. You sent the jade pendant here and made the madam sad. Taste this.
accept_26725_1=I know you have been with Xiang Jiuchen for a long time. How is he now?
accept_26726_1=He is injured...(self-talking)
accept_26727_1=I need to discuss something with Corpse Emissary. You can go to visit your master now.
accept_26728_1=It seems that you are stronger now. Let's have a spar.
accept_26729_1=Good, you've made a great progress. Go to purchase some wine, let us have a chat overnight.
accept_26730_1=Oh, welcome. You can go find Qishu, he may be preserving some good wine.
accept_26731_1=I don't have any more, but you can go to Liuxiang Ravine, we all purchase wine there.
accept_26732_1=Alright, go and back quickly.
accept_26733_1=Our wine is famous because we're using high quality spring, but recently, the spring water has become quite cloudy. In this case we can't make new wine. I've sent a person to check the situation at the source. Can you help us?
accept_26734_1=A tree has been pushed out and thrown nearby, that makes the water be polluted.
accept_26735_1=I think we should block the hole first. After waiting for the water to subside, then the water may become clear enough to use.
accept_26736_1=By the way, I have another thing. Recently, a white tiger which is very fierce came here. Can you...
accept_26737_1=Thanks. Please you go back to the Winery first. I want to observe more.
accept_26738_1=Hero, here is a jar of wine presented by us. We all admire you very much. The tree at the source used to belong to our host. She must know the reason.
accept_26739_1=So what?
accept_26740_1=It's none of your business. Are you from Wanderer's Valley? Taste this.
accept_26741_1=I know, it's all because of that person.
accept_26742_1=What's wrong, hero?
accept_26743_1=She, sign...
accept_26744_1=I'm alright...(silent)
accept_26745_1=You must be ready for death, haha. Taste my blade.
accept_26746_1=Be mercy. The person you're looking for now is not in Yongle Temple.
accept_26747_1=They are now at Niujia Village and they are fine.
accept_26748_1=You are?
accept_26749_1=The bludgers have a leader who is in Yongle Temple. They often bully common people.
accept_26750_1=I know that you came for this. You seem to be a Wanderer's Valley disciple, right?
accept_26751_1=My son is buried nearby Nine Qu Stream. Can you help me worship him? Remember to be careful, there are some bludgers nearby.
accept_26753_1=You're a kind and clever person. How luck is your master to have a disciple like you.
accept_26754_1=Don't be sad. Hurry to tell Yin Feng, don't let then be sad.
accept_26755_1=Are you sure? You're really my excellent disciple.
accept_26756_1=Valley Leader is also back. He asked you to visit him as soon as possible.
accept_26757_1=Wonderful. You are worthy of our Wanderer's Valley Elite.
accept_26758_1=Attack me with the array you learned.
accept_26759_1=This array is hard to solve. What else do you find at Wudang?
accept_26760_1=I'm still confused with the swift movement in this array. Let's have a spar again.
accept_26761_1=I need to study more with the array. Come with me.
accept_26762_1=Let's stop here. A disciple just came and wanted to report something. Go to ask the situation.
accept_26763_1=Someone has reported that the Ghost Emissary is killing others down the mountain.
accept_26764_1=Yeah, I'll go to stop the Ghost Emissary with some disciples.
accept_26765_1=Anyhow, make your master calm down.
accept_26766_1=You, hand her over!
accept_26767_1=I, I...hurry to find her.
accept_26768_1=I didn't notice just now. How did you defeat me?
complete_26721=Too slow, don't you want to keep alive?
complete_26722=You're back, I'm just looking for you.
complete_26723=This jade pendant was presented by the wife of Valley Leader, meaning her love. Now Xiang Jiuchen returned this pendant, that is to say they have no relation any more.
complete_26724=Stop, it's none of your business.
complete_26725=He, he injured so seriously...
complete_26726=I...
complete_26727=You've come back.
complete_26728=You're quite powerful now...
complete_26729=Hero, you're back. We all miss you very much.
complete_26730=Ah, it's you.
complete_26731=Hehe, maybe.
complete_26732=Are you coming for purchasing wine? But we don't have wine now.
complete_26733=What do you want?
complete_26734=I think we should block the big hole first.
complete_26735=You have a lot of strength. I'll block the hole.
complete_26736=How's it going?
complete_26737=Thank you very much.
complete_26738=Who are you? Why do you come to me?
complete_26739=Who are you? It's none of your business.
complete_26740=How do you feel, young hero?
complete_26741=I'm sure I remember his name correctly. Do you know him?
complete_26742=You're come. Why is the wine?
complete_26743=It's an old woman.
complete_26744=Are you here to seek death?
complete_26745=Hero,  have mercy!
complete_26746=I do not dare.
complete_26747=You are?
complete_26748=You are so kind.
complete_26749=How do you feel, young hero?
complete_26750=It has been a long time since my daughter got angry and went to open the winery alone.
complete_26751=Thanks.
complete_26753=Don't worry.
complete_26754=Where have you been?
complete_26755=Good.
complete_26756=You've come back.
complete_26757=oh?
complete_26758=The array goes like flowing water. It's really hard to be dealt with.
complete_26759=I will gather Wanderer's Valley Elite Disciples to learn the array now.
complete_26760=I've already understood.
complete_26761=The incident has its own reason and result, and you'll know soon.
complete_26762=The Ghost Emissary is killing everyone he met in Winding Valley.
complete_26763=Yes!
complete_26764=I see. The one who is going crazy is just your master.
complete_26765=Kill...Kill…Kill…
complete_26766=I, I...Ah!!
complete_26767=How can I calm down!
complete_26768=Make him peace, then discuss together again.
context_26721=I don't know, but Corpse Emissary said that you should go to visit her first after coming back.
context_26722=I don't where is the Valley Leader, and he may have come back, but the madam knows that you have gone to Wudang and asked you to meet her first when you come back.
context_26723=(No words but grieve alone)...
context_26724=Corpse Emissary was angry when he learned that Xiang Jiuchen returned the jade pendant to the wife of Valley Leader, and she wanted to kill Xiang Jiuchen.
context_26725=The madam stopped your fight against Corpse Emissary, then she asked about Xiang Jiuchen's situation.
context_26726=The madam is worried about Xiang Jiuchen's injury.
context_26727=Madam Wu is going to discuss something with Corpse Emissary, and she doesn't want to be disturbed.
context_26728=Visit your master, Ghost Emissary later. Your master would like to spar with you.
context_26729=Your master is glad for your martial arts. He wants to drink wine with you.
context_26730=Go to the village and find Chai Qishu.
context_26731=Chai Qishu's wine has been sold out.
context_26732=Go to Liuxiang Ravine to ask for the reason.
context_26733=The workers in Liuxiang Ravine also said that there was no wine now. Ask for the reason.
context_26734=The spring used by Liuxiang Ravine was polluted. Listen to villagers about the situation.
context_26735=The villager wanted to block the hole with rocks first.
context_26736=The hole has been blocked. The villager said that there was a white tiger nearby, and he wanted you to defeat it.
context_26737=Back to the Winery and report that you've solved the problem.
context_26738=You've solved the problem of the spring, and the worker presented you with a jar of wine. Go to find Winery Manager to ask more about the spring.
context_26739=The tree at the source is the favorite of the Winery owner. Now the tree has been cut down, find the Winery owner and ask for the reason.
context_26740=The Winery owner said that the tree was destroyed by here, and she started to attack you. Find the Winemaker Shifu and ask for the reason.
context_26741=Defeated the Winery owner. Back to ask Master Mei what happened on earth.
context_26742=Winemaker Shifu said that the person who appointed with Winery owner is Yin Feng. You decided to ask your master about the reasons.
context_26743=Ask your master what has happened.
context_26744=Yin Feng said that if the old woman in Yongle Temple did not forgive him, he would not see the Winery owner. It seemed that you still need to ask the old woman why.
context_26745=You came to Yongle Temple and found that Yongle Temple is occupied by a gang of bludgers. Defeat a bludger and ask why.
context_26746=Defeated the bludger. You're told that the people in Yongle Temple had been driven to Niujia Village at south.
context_26747=Head to Niujia Village and find that old woman.
context_26748=You explained the situation at Yongle Temple to the old woman.
context_26749=The old woman said that the bludgers have a leader and asked you to defeat him.
context_26750=The old woman said that the winery owner is her daughter. The reason why her daughter was not allowed to meet with Yin Feng was because of a mistake made by Yin Feng.
context_26751=The old woman said that her son was buried near Nine Qu Stream and hoped you to make a worship on her behalf.
context_26753=The old woman said that she had forgiven the Ghost Emissary.
context_26754=The old woman asked you to tell Yin Feng that she had forgiven him.
context_26755=The Ghost Emissary was very glad to hear that the old woman had forgiven him and was going to find the girl in the winery.
context_26756=The Ghost Emissary told you that Valley Leader has been back.
context_26757=You gave Valley Leader the Seven Stars Array and explained the array for him. He was quite satisfied.
context_26758=Use the array you learned to spar with the Valley Leader.
context_26759=You told the incidents about Silent Temple and Wudang to the Valley Leader. He said that's why he wanted to get the Seven Stars Array.
context_26760=The Valley Leader wanted to spar with you again to practice the movements of the array.
context_26761=The valley master explained another thing, about the fate of Wanderer's Valley and him.
context_26762=A disciple came to report that the Ghost Emissary was on a killing spree.
context_26763=Listen to Wanderer's Valley Disciple to explain.
context_26764=The disciple told you that reason of the Ghost Emissary's madness. Report to the Valley Leader about this.
context_26766=Yin Feng is in fury now, defeat him.
context_26767=The Ghost Emissary has calmed down, ask him the reason.
context_26768=The Ghost Emissary has calmed down, back to find Wanderer's Valley Leader, Dan Tianming.
