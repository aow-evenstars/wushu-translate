accept_26649_1=A disciple of the Beggar's Sect just came to see you, saying that he was ordered by Leader Xiao of the Beggar's Sect and was afraid that the elders of the Beggar's Sect would embarrass you.
accept_26650_1=So you are {@0:name}.
accept_26651_1=Let me think about it!
accept_26652_1=I won't believe in you, evil cult. Don't persuade me with Leader Xiao, he won't let an evil person like you pass the message. I guess that Beggar's Sect Disciple was also bribed by you, and you were trying to send me away.
accept_26653_1=I just past by and found that the Tartars were deploying soldiers. They were planing to attack the city, and I killed one of their generals.
accept_26661_1=Let's wait and talk about this later. You must have improved your martial art skills now! How about we have a spar here?
accept_26662_1=That's exactly what I'm thinking. I just purchased some wine. Come on, let's have a drink together.
accept_26663_1=We must report this to Valley Leader. In this way, I will go back to find Valley Leader, and you go to Wudang and find Seven-star Array at Yu Xuanzi instead of me.
accept_26664_1=Old General is looking for you. Please visit him at once.
accept_26672_1=Then I'll take it. When you are in need, I must lead people to help you.
complete_26625=Your martial art skills are good.
complete_26626=Who are you? How did you get in?
complete_26627=Who are you? What are you doing here?
complete_26628=My pleasure!
complete_26629=Young Master, I'm the heeler of Liu Ji. Since I was arranged to defend Juyong Pass, I've been waiting for you for too many years.
complete_26637=Oh, my daughter...
complete_26638=Oh, thank you, young hero.
complete_26639=Thank you.
complete_26640=What's the matter, young master?
complete_26649=Why are you chasing me?
complete_26650=What else do you want to do?
complete_26651=Stop talking. I won't be cheated by you.
complete_26652={@0:name}...
complete_26653=You come back so soon!
complete_26661=You're too modest.
complete_26662=No, thanks. Just cultivate and comprehend by yourself. I'd like to help you if you have any question. ({@0:name} is so kind to share such a script with me)
complete_26663=Are you {@0:name}?
complete_26664=I can't accept it. It is left by the old master to you.
complete_26672=Training mind is also training your way. How to explain this?
context_26625=Entrusted by Leader Xiao, go to the Sixteen Prefectures and find Beggar's Sect Elder to help him.
context_26626=The Beggar's Sect Elder is arranging disciple to defend Tartars in the Wushu Gathering Hall.
context_26627=You told your purpose in coming to the elder but he didn't believe in you, and fought against you.
context_26628=Escaped to Zhenlu Pass and received the help of patrols. Follow them to visit the Old General.
context_26629=Gu Xiong was originally a heeler of Liu Ji. He was orders to guard Zhenlu Pass and has been waiting for Liu Ji's posterity. Liu Ji had once told him that if the emperor was cruel and unkind, he could use his armies to stand up for another judicious lord.
context_26637=You heard that Fantian Gang was doing evil things nearby. This gang used to be a small group, but it became bigger after the arrival of Tartars.
context_26638=Query about Fantian Gang at Shouwang Village. Help the villagers there to drive away the harassing Fantian Gang Disciples and seize back the provisions.
context_26639=The woman's daughter was kidnapped by Fantian Gang's disciples. Go to Fantian Gang's camp and save her daughter.
context_26640=Learned about the conspiracy of Silent Temple. Take the lady to escape from Fantian Gang's camp.
context_26649=Old General told you that a Beggar's Sect Disciple who was sent by Leader Xiao had arrived to find you.
context_26650=The Beggar's Sect Disciple came to Wushu Gathering Hall together with you and explained your identity to the elder.
context_26651=Fan Dan still doesn't believe in you. He insisted that you have some conspiracy.
context_26652=Fan Dan suspected that you want to send him away then you may have the chance to carry out some conspiracy.
context_26653=Meet with Jie Ang outside the Tartar Camp. He told you that he defeated a Tartar general. Go to Tartar Camp with him, and ask the Tartar Commander to stop seizing.
context_26661=Spar with Jie Ang and discuss with him about martial arts. He raised several points.
context_26662=During the conversation, you suddenly thought of the duster cloth. You took it out and shared it with Jie Ang. Jie Ang found that it is the manual of Blood Sea Demon Blade. You finally knew why you were pursued, and it turned out that you really owned a script. You invited Jie Ang to study together. Jie Ang was greatly touched by your selflessness. But Jie Ang said that he doesn't use blade skills, and learning this would affect what he has learned before. So he let you learn the skills by yourself.
context_26663=You told Jie Ang about the Silent Temple. He said it is of great importance and needed to be reported to the Valley Leader immediately. So Jie Ang asked you to go to Wudang alone to find Seven-star Array at Yu Xuanzi, and he would go back to Wanderer's Valley.
context_26664=When on your way to Wudang, the gate soldier at Pass Guarding Mountain told you that the Old General was looking for you.
context_26672=Old General asked you if you want to be the emperor. You refused and gave the Tiger Talisman back to the Old General. Then you continued to go to Wudang to find Seven-star Array.
