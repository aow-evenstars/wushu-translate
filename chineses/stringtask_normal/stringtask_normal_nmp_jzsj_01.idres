But it'll require great strength to bring down this ferocious beast. The residents around her will be harmed if this evil beast isn't brought down. As the goal of the Shen Family is to save people, there's no way we can sit and watch this evil beast harming people at will. According to the latest news from the Expert Hunter, the long-vanished Flame Grass exists in the Fierce Tiger's hidden place. This kind of grass is very hot and usually grow in the cracks between cold, dank rocks. To people who don't know about it, it is an ordinary herb. But to us in the Golden Needle Sect it is one of the greatest treasures. It is one of the materials that we use to make our Shen Family's special medicine. Hurry and catch the Fierce Tiger. Harvest Flame Grass when you get the chance.
context_41540=<s><s>What an eventful time. A while back the Expert Hunter from the Beast Villa reported back that a huge Scorpion appeared around XX. This Scorpion has powerful poison, and normal people will rot away and die within seven or eight minutes after being poisoned by the Scorpion. Sadly, many residents around here got poisoned and died a hard death. The Shen Family's mission is to save lives and treat people. It's essential for us to save these suffering people. We must destroy the Scorpion and save people's lives.

The feathers of this eagle are incomparably sharp, and Silver Witchgrass is a hard-to-find herbal medicine.
