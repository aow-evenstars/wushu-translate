accept_26566_1=Tianxiao is a person of Tangmen. We all feel sorry to him.
accept_26567_1=What's going on?
accept_26570_1=Since the King Snake is dead, the other snakes will compete for the king. Those peace snakes all become fierce.

complete_26531=Who are you?
complete_26532=Many years ago, our ancestors put hundreds of kinds of snakes into the Snake Cave and let them breed. Nowadays, even a normal snake inside it is more toxic than a cobra outside.
complete_26535=Young...young hero, help...
complete_26536=(Swallow the snake poison) It tastes strange, but I feel better now. Thanks.
complete_26537=Oh you came back, let me have a look. This is...
complete_26538=Go deep in the Snake Cave this time. Collect some fine snake venom to exchange Blossom of the Seven Stars with me.
complete_26540=Eh...(This is the Wanderer's Valley Disciple who sneaked into Shaolin) ...You Tangmen people just colluded with Wanderer's Valley, and poisoned Wulin righteous schools.
complete_26541=You demon...(This evil is so powerful) ...Tang Shaoang, we all see the incidents happened today, and we'll report these to the Alliance Leader.
complete_26542=I've said that the poison was used by Five Immortals Sect. You can think whatever you want.
complete_26543=(hisses)
complete_26546=(Sniff with nose) What a familiar smell. Are you poisoned by Tangmen?
complete_26550=You can call me Tianxiao. I will save anyone who is poisoned by Tangmen, and I will kill anyone who is saved by Tangmen.
complete_26552=Listen to me, holding the red pill in your mouth can help you protect poison, so you must use the red one first.
complete_26553=Wait.
complete_26554=What's going on with such a strong miasma?
complete_26557=Thank you for thinking highly of me.
complete_26558=Did you just say Tianxiao is still alive?
complete_26560=Tang Feng? Are you the Grandmother? (Tang Feng asked: Will you intercept me?) I...I...
