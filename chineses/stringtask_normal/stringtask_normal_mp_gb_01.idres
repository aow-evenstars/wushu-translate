accept_44001_1=Find Elder Jiao and learn the rules of the Beggar's Sect.
accept_44005_1=It probably won't surprise you to hear that we run into trouble occasionally. You should only fight in self defense or when innocents are in danger. Fang Dayou can train you in martial arts, if you're interested.
accept_44008_1=We don't have to beg for food because we know a few tricks. Here, take this ground meat, and use it to lure a wild dog back to Zhan Huasheng.
accept_44010_1=Who needs kung fu when you can make great chicken?
accept_44015_1=How I got here doesn't matter.  I am searching for an edible ant on this mountain called Forest Ant. It's bigger than ordinary ants, and is completely black. Please find it for me.
accept_44016_1=Don't hit me! I was just hungry…I wasn't trying to escape!
accept_44027_1=Please help us find some food and water. Just a little!
accept_44029_1=I have heard of the famous Jiaohua Chicken, I hope one day I get to try it. There's a young beggar heading this way, do you know him?
accept_44030_1=Don't worry about the refugees, I'll take care of them. Do be careful though.
accept_44032_1=Please help us find some food and water. Just a little!
accept_44038_1=Go back and find Tang Ye! He's a former Tangmen, and can detoxify a Seven-Star Needle. Why are you still standing here? Go!
accept_44038_2=After rescuing Zhan Huasheng, remember to rescue the refugees as well. They have suffered a lot, so don't forget about them.
complete_44001=Disciples should make a point of remembering the sect rules very well. Whoever breaks the Beggar's Sect code will be punished according the the sect rules. Got it?
complete_44001_1=You learn quickly, but remember, some rules are quite complicated. Each beggar is different, so different rules apply to each one. You'll come to understand what I mean.
complete_44002=It seems you behaved very well at Taoist Jiao's. Seldom will new disciples remember the gang rules so well.
complete_44003=What the…where did you go, the Imperial Palace? The first time I went begging, all I got was a boot in the head!
complete_44004=This is a song we sing while we beg. It keeps us entertained and brings good luck.
complete_44004_1=We call it "Lotus Falling". You should hear it when someone has bamboo clappers. Beautiful.
complete_44005=Pretty good for your first time.
complete_44006=Make yourself at home, joining Beggar's Sect is like joining a family.
complete_44008=You lured the dog here? Looks like you've done this before.
complete_44008_1=He's always trying to avoid chores. Thanks, we will eat tonight!
complete_44009=You found those ingedients so fast, excellent work!
complete_44010=Be patient you glutton. It's too early to eat right now. We won't count you out when we eat later, don't worry.
complete_44011=You completed the task so fast, nice job!
complete_44011_1=I know quite a few techniques for catching animals. I can show you them later.
complete_44013=Ah, you're finally here. Ant Mountain is just ahead.
complete_44014=Well, have you found the ant nest? Why are you in such a hurry? What happened?
complete_44014_1=Have you found the ant nest? What happened?
complete_44015=Please, young beggar, go beg elsewere. We're probably worse off than you.
complete_44016=Please, young beggar, go beg elsewere. We're probably worse off than you.
complete_44017=Thank you for your help! They would have beaten us and taken everything we own!
complete_44017_1=We're refugees from Shanxi. The soldiers were supposed to be our escorts, instead they've robbed and abused us. I think they realized that we'd report what they've done so they hired the bandits to hold us as prisoners.
complete_44018=I'll let Geng know as soon as I get the chance.
complete_44018_1=Bandits have been kidnapping the women. Can you help us?
complete_44019=Where have you been? Did you find the ants?
complete_44019_1=What? The soldiers and the bandits are working together?!
complete_44025=Finally you're back! Those bandits had me very worried.
complete_44025_1=I'm glad you're safe. Bandit patrols are everywhere.
complete_44026=They still don't know that you killed those bandits.
complete_44027=These cookies should last us until we escape. Thanks.
complete_44028=So much wild fruit. It is enough. We can only eat a little.
complete_44029=Help! Brother Zhan Huasheng was caught by the military! He tried to infiltrate the battalion but they noticed and captured him. He told me to come to you if he was in danger.
complete_44030=Spare me. I have to earn bread for my newborn baby and aged mother.
complete_44031=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >  </font><font face="Default" color="#8fd6ef" >You look busy.</font>
complete_44031_1=Zhan was captured? What on earth happened?
complete_44032=Thank you, I haven't eaten in days.
complete_44037=What's wrong?
complete_44037_1=What have you done? Defending the innocent is one thing, but to challenge the government and an entire bandit gang? Those refugees will suffer the consequences of your actions!
complete_44038=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >It's you! You're back! </font><font face="Default" color="#8fd6ef" ></font>
complete_44040=When the Beggars arrive, these refugees will be safe.
complete_44041=My guards are no match for you.
complete_44042=What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be helping the refugees escape?
complete_44043=It's nice to see you again!
complete_44043_1=That was a close call, kid. I was inches from death.
complete_44044=Zhan told me what happened. Don't take what Jiao said personally. I'll deliver the Silver Book to the Shanxi Governor.
context_44001=Find Elder Jiao and learn the rules of the Beggar's Sect.
context_44002=You've memorized the rules, have you? Let's see.
context_44003=We get treated badly. You should try it out to see if you really want to be a beggar.
context_44004=We deal with many rude, angry, and disrespectful people, but we smile on anyways because we still have our dignity. Now listen up, I'm going to teach you a song.
context_44005=<s> Good! We usually meet some vicious person and beat by them when we beg. But we still can not fight with them. However, we should help others when we meet something unfair. And at the same times, martial arts can not be delayed. Go and look for Pang Dayou to learn skills.
context_44006=<s>In addition to training martial arts, in order to live, we disciples of the Beggar's Sect should learn some life skills necessarily. The eight pockets disciple Zhan Huasheng in our sect is very wise, upright and full of leadership, and you can find him to learn some life skills.
context_44008=We don't have to beg for food because we know a few tricks. Here, take this ground meat, and use it to lure a wild dog back to Zhan Huasheng.
context_44009=Now I'll teach you my ultimate recipe! Jiaohua Chicken! You'll have to get me a few ingredients first so I can show you how to make this delicious meal; get me some wine and rice from the villagers' houses and gauze from the Elder Sisters. And hurry, I'm starving!
context_44010=<s>Cooking Beggar's Sect Jiaohua chicken requires great skill. I'm very talented at this.
context_44013=Ants are a good source of nutrition. There's an ant hill not too far from here, wait for me on the foothill nearby.
context_44014=You should be looking for the forest ant, its black and larger than the other poisonous ones.
context_44015=<s>A panicked villager appeared after you saw the corpse. Help him return safely to Shanxi.
context_44016=<s>Please don't hit me. I am just looking for something to eat rather than escaping. I go back right away.
context_44017=Ask me any questions you want, but be quick about it. If roving bandits see us talking it'll be very bad... get out of here, quickly! They're coming!
context_44018=<s>No one will fight or seek justice for us. We'll be grateful as long as we have enough food to eat.
context_44019=No offense, but I'm not sure that a novice such as yourself would be enough to help us. We're helpless and without allies. Since you're a disciple, could you perhaps get the Beggar's Sect to aid us?
context_44025=Theres no time to waste, we'll have to split up . You go save that girl and protect the refugees. I'll obtain incriminating evidence from the government soldiers.
context_44026=How admirable the justice of Beggar's Sect is. If we have the chance, we also want to join Beggar's Sect... Ah! They are coming!
context_44027=Go back to Beggar's Sect and find some food and water for the refugees. Beggar's Sect have many water vats and wells but if you can't find it, I can go to the river to fetch a bucket.
context_44028=I need another favor. We haven't eaten anything in two days. Could you get us food and water please?
context_44029=<s>I didn't expect that I could eat such tasty food. That little beggar wants to see you.
context_44030=<s>Be careful.
context_44031=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >He is upstairs. Help yourself, I won't say a word. </font><font face="Default" color="#8fd6ef" ></font>
context_44032=Help these refugees find some food and water.
context_44037=I…am…speechless. Intead of telling us what was happening, you and Zhan Huasheng decided to take on an entire army! Now, he's been poisoned with the Seven Star Needle and our entire Sect is in danger! Just…just go talk to the boss. I need to sort this out.
context_44038=<s>Don't speak too much now. I will have someone give this silver book to Shanxi governor right now. Now you go to ask Shi elder to dispatch some more disciples with high martial arts to rescue Zhan Huasheng.
context_44040=One moment. I will get them.
context_44041=We need to act as soon as possible. I've had several brothers to scout the battalion's encampment. With the help of the bandits, the soldiers intend on moving the refugees very soon.
context_44042=Oh good. Another beggar to kill. I was getting bored.
context_44043=The refugees are safe, and Zhan Huasheng is healing. You are incredibly lucky, young one. If you EVER break our laws like this again, for ANY reason, frightened young disciples will be hearing stories of your punishment for centuries. Understood?
context_44044=The refugees are safe. Though you haven't been part of the sect for long, I see you have a lot of heart! Go see the sect leader, he wanted to see you.
menu_44001_1=I comply with your wishes.
menu_44002=I know the rules well. Please test me on them.
menu_44003=I will do it at once!
menu_44004=A song? One of those sung by beggars?

accept_44447_1=　　哎，我和刘兄弟偷上昆仑的事想必你也知道了，他全是为了提升我们丐帮困龙阵的威力才这样做的。眼下昆仑派的守卫已加强了很多，你前去可得多加小心。
