context_5101=I know the border guard, Colonel Zuo Haohan of Longmen Pass. Take this letter to him and he will look after you.
context_5102=I didn't come all the way out here to play catch-me with enemy rangers. Think you could kill a few, and scare them off?
context_5103=You have good martial arts skills. I have to stay here to keep a watch on those cold-blooded Striders, so I'm busy. Here, bring this letter to Longmen Pass and find Chiliarch Master Huo Dushan. You should earn his trust and then inform him of the situation here. Be careful! You should walk along the paths. Take this token of Longmen Pass and find old carter Yang Huoshi (1240 -13) who will lead you there.
context_5104=You are a wise guy! I'll enroll you in the Scout Camp since the colonel introduced you here. Scout the enemy's military situation. Find He Xiaowei and he'll arrange the preparations for you.
context_5105=Can you please help me tame a horse that escaped into the plains?
context_5106=An agile and brave Ferghana horse from the Imperial Court Army horse ranch was recently sent to to Longmen Pass to prepare for the battle. I won't have a chance to look at it. What a pity!
context_5107=Could you spy on the barbarians outside the Longmen Pass and keep me updated?
context_5108=Very well, it's urgent. Report it to Chiliarch officer Huo Dushan. He must have a plan.
context_5109=Oh, you know the Chiliarch? Go on, then, and wish him well for me!
context_5110=You came at the right time. Reinforcements from the court still haven't arrived. We can't count on them? We must take drastic measures to deal with the Barbarians now. Go find Jin Beiyu at Longmen Inn. She runs a Shady Store. You can ask her for some Knockout Drops.
context_5111=The Barbarians can't ride sick horses, can they? Sneak into the rear of their camp, and put these Knockout Drops in the Horse Ranch's water.
context_5112=The horse looked at the forage, shook its head, and ignored it.  The Dressage Handbook explains a  similar condition. The desert is often dry throughout the year, but occasionally there will be a drenching rain. Last night, it happened to be raining, and the forage piled up in the stable became wet. If the horse eats wet forage, it's easy to have loose bowels. You should dry the forage and then feed it to the horse.
context_5113=My friend He Xiu is a skilled fighter and a good man. He has not contacted me since he reached Longmen Inn. Please help me find him? To reach Longmen Inn, talk to Yang Huoshi (1240, -13) in the Northern Desert.
context_5114=I came here looking for my nephew, He Xiaowei. Ten years ago, he left to join the army, and no one has heard from him since. Please help me find him.
context_5115=He Xiaowei will not return. He misses his family, but has sworn to protect Border Town and serve his country.
context_5116=He Xiaowei is an ungrateful fool who wants nothing to do with his family.
context_5117=Thank you. I came from Zhuo Town in the desert, near Longmen Inn. My young mistress is getting married soon, and I have to make a red turban for her. Do you know where I can buy red silk thread?
context_5118=Thank you. I have something else to buy. Will you please help me to take the Red Silk Thread to Elder Sister Feng Xueqin in Zhuo Town?
context_5120=Shopkeeper Hua of Liang Mansion was robbed in order to save the offspring of loyal people. Please call up heroes from all directions, then go to Desert Ghost Town and save Shopkeeper Hua.
context_5121=Housekeeper Hua is safe, but the forces of the East Chamber are still in pursuit. We must flee, and quickly.
