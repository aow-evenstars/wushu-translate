accept_57506_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The insect poison, a craft of the Miao people, has been under the study of the Tangmen for generations. It appears Meijiao has been poisoned with "Love Poison"</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >.</font>

accept_57531_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Hmm. Should we risk the entire school just to save some people who are completely unrelated? The emperor has issued a holy decree. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We must not embarrass ourselves.</font>
