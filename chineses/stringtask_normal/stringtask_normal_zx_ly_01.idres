accept_26002_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Each day becomes worse than the previous since your Uncle Zhang left. It is fortunate you are able to often come and help me do some work. Bring this bowl of noodles back with you to eat and remember to stop by my house to drink some chicken soup. I'll make sure to let you have some drumsticks.</font>
accept_26002_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Silly child, how did you forget your birthday already. Your father didn't know when you were born, so he had to use the day he brought you home as your birthday. Now time flew and so many years have passed...</font>
accept_26003_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Such devotion you have! I have nothing else that needs to be done. Ah yes, what is troubling the Village Head lately. I do not know if it is concerning another government taxing us or not. If you have time, you should go check it out.</font>
accept_26004_1=Alas... It's always either natural or man-made disasters! A huge plot of the crops we planted was all eaten up by mice. The ones that were not eaten were put into the granary, yet were stolen. It must have been the work of those hooligans in this village. Go check and see if they come back again.
accept_26005_1=Alas... Everyone says natural disasters are sufferable and that man-made disasters are unpreventable. Ah yes, there is a letter at my place that was sent by my son living in Yanjing. I can't read, why don't you tell me what he wrote.
accept_26006_1=Write a letter to that insolent son of mine then. Tell him that if he doesn't want me, then I will disown him. My oh my... If only I've known earlier, I would have seriously studied back then. Maybe I wouldn't be so detested by my son, and can't even write a letter on my own.
accept_26007_1=By the way... There is one more thing I must trouble you with. The messenger has already left for Luoyang this morning, so I need your assistance in delivering this letter to Luoyang. Have these silver pieces too. I was going to give them to that insolent son of mine originally, but you take them and buy some food for yourself on the way.
accept_26008_1=Stop pretending... Hand over the "Sea of Blood Demon Blade" quickly and I will spare your life.
accept_26008_2=Looks like you don't even care about your life anymore. The skill you were using on the hooligans was Demon Blade Elder's unique skill "Broken Bone Claw"! Now you have to admit you have the "Sea of Blood Demon Blade" on you!
accept_26009_1=Give that Script, and I will spare your life. Otherwise...
accept_26009_2=It looks like a book. How else can a manual look like? Playing fool is not going to spare your life.
accept_26010_1=Looks like I'd have to study it after I get back...
accept_26011_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Here you go. Please take the silver. You look quite unfamiliar. It must be your first time in Luoyang. You should go look around.</font>
accept_26012_1=Meng Shang is my Eldest Disciple. You should exchange a couple of skills with him to see how your foundation is.
accept_26013_1=The essence of Martial Arts is at the heart. Every skill comes from the heart. Now you can go into the Martial school to duel with your martial brother, and feel the wondrous flow between the skills.
accept_26014_1=To become a grandmaster, external skills may be important, but your internal cultivation must not be lacking either. The result of the combat between experts is often determined by the strength of your inner skill. Hence, I would like for you to build a good foundation, and cultivate both internally and externally... If there are anything else you don't understand, you can ask your elder martial brother Meng Nan.
accept_26015_1=The Martial Arts are deep and specialized. Even though perseverance is very important, the accumulation of experience is just as important as enlightening from scripts. Going around Jianghu to gain experience is a good method.
accept_26016_1="Sea of Blood Demon Blade"... If you turn over the manual to my care, I will protect your life. Otherwise, I will throw you into jail like a criminal.
accept_26017_1=Royal Guard? How would there be a Royal Guard in county court? Follow me, I'll take you to the Beggars.
accept_26018_1=Thank you for driving those hooligans away for me. I will take you to our Hall Leader.
accept_26019_1=Hahaha, "Sea of Blood Demon Blade" is just a Jianghu rumor. We the Beggar Disciples are spread all over the world. We have heard of rumors that are far more exciting than this.
accept_26020_1=You can settle in the Beggar Sect, and most Jianghu people will leave you alone. Even though I am not the best in martial arts, I am still a Hall leader. How about learning a couple of skills from me? Let's exchange a couple of skills first.
accept_26021_1=You have to join a school. Each school has different skill sets. Of course each school would have some unique skills to be able to stand in Jianghu. Why don't you join us at Beggar Sect?
accept_26022_1=I just heard from that disciple, that this person's brother was killed by Demon Blade Elder. He must really want to kill you for revenge.
accept_26023_1=Please be careful.
accept_26024_1=Duanmu brother! Come take care of this lad. I got injured by him, but I'll cut him off for you.
accept_26025_1=Hand over the "Sea of Blood Demon Blade" if you know better. Otherwise, when we drag you back, only scattered remains will be left of you.
accept_26026_1=Ha! Rest assured? I trusted you too much. You scammed the 20 liang of silver my son had finally saved up. Good thing the old scholar from the neighboring village came visit and saw my letter, then I would still have been in the dark. Quick, hand over that silver. None of these thugs behind me are jokes.
accept_26027_1=I have taught you the basics to real combat. You have great potential and learn quite well. It's better for you to ask the master to see what else he can teach you.
accept_26048_1=I am on my way to Wanderer's Valley. You seem quite agile, it only make sense if you have great martial skills. How did you get into such an awful state?
complete_26001=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thank you, my lad. There are guests coming today. There's nothing fancy to treat them, so I slaughtered a chicken to brew some stew. Come back for food later, would you?</font>
complete_26002=Are you full? There is more in the pot, I'll go get more for you. I am too old to take care of you much longer.
complete_26003=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" > Sigh, the economy has been bad all the recent years. The seeds we sow don't yield much crops. A lot of people have left for other villages to make a living. Seems like our village is going to go into ruins, that makes me really anxious.</font>
complete_26004=Have you caught them? We have very little amount of food left in the village. If we keep losing more, we won't have enough rice for every family. There will be no use to report to the authorities by then.
complete_26005=This insolent son. Got married, popped a son and forget about his dad who raised him. This enrages me. Fine then. If he doesn't want me, I will just disown him!
complete_26006=Are you done? Read it to me.
complete_26007=Do what I say if you want to live, lad!
complete_26008=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I heard you have the "Sea of Blood Demon Blade" in your collection here. I am here just for this book.</font>
complete_26009=That's true... Smart of you there.
complete_26010=Hi, are you here to deposit or to withdraw?
complete_26011=Young man, what do you think? Do you want to come learn some martial skills at my school?
complete_26012=<s>Seems like you are compelled towards martial arts. Why not take me as your master.
complete_26013=I wonder how First Martial Brother gets along with the teaching.
complete_26013_1=En, that's good. You need practice more in future so that my good intention won't be wasted.
complete_26014=How is it?
complete_26015=Who is it, how dare you charging around in my patrol zone?
complete_26016=<s>What happened? You look so beat up.
complete_26017=All thanks to you. Where is Fang Tong taking you?
complete_26018=I heard all about it from Xiao Qing. Royal Guards are cruel and merciless. It's not a surprise that they have infiltrated the government. Just too bad now we will be under more turmoil in Jianghu.
complete_26019=Seeing how sincere you are, and it doesn't seem like you are lying, I will explain to the Sect Leader so that no beggar will start trouble with you from now on. That Demon Blade Elder's martial art is extremely evil, it's better for you not to practice it anymore.
complete_26020=These skills you can just spend a little bit of money and learn from the Martial School. Even if you have mastered it, you are no better than a regular martial artist. It's nothing extraordinary.
complete_26021=These people are after you again. They surely do not treasure their own lives, to have the guts to mess around in Beggar Sect.
complete_26022=You must stay alert. Consider that as my concern for the Beggar Sect.
complete_26023=<s>This lad is not weak.
complete_26024=Come on kid. You are better off just following us. Maybe we'd just kill you right here right now if you keep defying us.
complete_26025=Little rascal! Stop right now!
complete_26026=<s>Why so beat up? What's going on?
complete_26027=I am surprised you returned so soon. I have indeed not misread you. But you still have a long way to go...
complete_26048=You have reached Wanderer's Valley, now you are finally safe right? Hahaha.
context_26001=New day has started. Sounds like someone is calling me.
context_26002=Each day becomes worse than the previous since your Uncle Zhang left. It is fortunate you are able to often come and help me do some work. Eat this bowl of noodles while it is still hot, and there is more when you are done. The day your dad brought you home, he didn't know your actual birthday, so he had used the as your birthday instead. Now so many years have gone by already.
context_26003=The Village Head seems to be troubled about something. Why don't you go check it out and see if the government is planning on putting more tax on us.
context_26004=Alas... It's always either natural or man-made disasters! A huge plot of the crops we planted was all eaten up by mice. The ones that were not eaten were put into the granary, yet were stolen. It must have been the work of those hooligans in this village. Go check and see if they come back again.
context_26005=Sigh, there is no stopping of natural disasters. By the way, there's a letter from my son, I cannot read. Why don't you read for me.
context_26006=Write a letter to that insolent son of mine then. Tell him that if he doesn't want me, then I will disown him. My oh my... If only I've known earlier, I would have seriously studied back then. Maybe I wouldn't be so detested by my son, and can't even write a letter on my own.

context_26008=Stop pretending... Hand over the "Sea of Blood Demon Blade" quickly and I will spare your life.
context_26009=Give that Script, and I will spare your life. Otherwise...
context_26010=You used a fake manual to cheat Wu Xuebing. This is no longer a safe place. It's better to go elsewhere to hide. You decided to use this mail delivery opportunity to go hide in Luoyang city, while taking that 20 liang of silver to have a good time.
context_26011=Here you go. Please take the silver. You look quite unfamiliar. It must be your first time in Luoyang. You should go look around.
context_26012=Meng Shang is my Eldest Disciple. You should exchange a couple of skills with him to see how your foundation is.

context_26015=Martial master Wang Dali reminded you that learning martial arts requires experience. So you decided to go look around in the city.
context_26016="Sea of Blood Demon Blade"... If you turn over the manual to my care, I will protect your life. Otherwise, I will throw you into jail like a criminal.
context_26017=Royal Guard? How can there be a Royal Guard in county court? Follow me, I'll take you to the Beggars.

Wanderer's Valley is a major school in Jianghu, a lot of schools show great respect around them. Now Wanderer Valley is recruiting talented disciples. If you can join Wanderer's Valley, nobody will every bully you again.
