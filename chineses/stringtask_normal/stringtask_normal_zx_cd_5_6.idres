context_34233=<s>Be careful on the road. Thank you for helping Nishang Palace!
context_34234=<s>You'd better stay in Nishang Palace to heal the wound since you were injured before. Oh, some disciples are impatient since they haven't recovered after being poisoned for a long time. Ji Youqing and Bian Lingjun had a fight some time ago and ignored each other. Can you mediate between them?
context_34235=Can you go to get one thing for me?
context_34236=Bian has been fond of this hair clasp. She often asks me to give it to her. Please present it to her to make my apology.
context_34237=Huanhua Sect has sent the medicine Huanhua before thanks to you. We are preparing the medicine. Can you go to ask Nalan Qing'er if the medicine is ready?
context_34238=Before we get Danxia Grass, we can only rely on the pill that is prepared with the medicine Huanhua. The efficacy is limited, but this is the only thing we can do. We've developed the antidote. Please take it to Ji Youqing.
context_34239=I'm much better, but I feel a sharp pain in my body occasionally. I hope the medicine for removing the poison will be developed soon.
context_34240=Some people are yelling outside the door. They seem to be people of Tianwaitian! They want us to hand you out, and say many things unpleasing to hear! Damned it!
context_34241=<s>Li Qiang looks anxious. I wonder what happened to her. Talk with her and see what happened.
context_34242=<s>Linghu Xue refined Danxia Grass into Lingxia Pills. Remove the poison on Bian Lingjun and Ji Youqing with the pills.

context_34256=<s>You find Xiao Tianfang and tell him your purpose in coming, but he doesn't believe you. To feel you out, he lies that he is poisoned, and hopes you find the Antidote for him. You promise to collect Yeci Herb and BaiCang Mushroom for him.
context_34257=<s>You see Xiao Tianfang finally. Talk with him and see how much he knows about Insect poison. Also ask him about your life experience.
context_34260=<s>Xiao Tianfang says that people of Evil Men's Valley are yelling outside the door. He hopes you can have a look.
context_34261=<s>Ask why Fei Bai is sad, and help her find out why Pakchoi avoids her. See if there's facts he wishes to hide.
context_34262=<s>Fei Bai cries with joy after she knows the truth, but she doesn't know if Xiao Tianfang agrees with their marriage.
context_34263=<s>Xiao Tianfang is very happy at the news. He asks you to get some liquor and let people celebrate it. Then tell it to Fei Bai. Unexpectedly, a killer of Evil Men's Valley wants to kill Fei Bai.
