accept_50010_1=I've forbidden Corpse Melting Liquid in my early years. Common disciples don't need to know the reason. Members in Tangmen are forbidden to test poison on living people and make poisons without permission according to the rules in the sect. Tang Guanqun violated both rules.
accept_50011_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >It is time. Speak to Lu Feng outside the Tang Family Castle. He will tell you how to get inside the Heaven Treasure Stronghold.</font>
accept_50012_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Listen. I found a dead man outside the walls yesterday. Everyone thinks he died of natural causes, but the snakes say it's poison. You Tangmen are poison experts, right? Can you take a look?</font>

accept_50022_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >  Well, I've been hearing some troubling rumors, but asking around will just get you in trouble. Most everyone is loyal to that cockroach Guanque. Huang Si, our friend with the snakes, is not. He might have some advice for you.</font>

accept_50038_2=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Disagree if you must, but OBEY. Tang Feng is lucky. Guanqun will be fed his own poison. You will see to that as well. Go.</font>
accept_50039_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Guanqun was a talented child, but resented being told what to do. It saddens me to see what he has become.</font>
accept_50041_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Harden your heart, young one. We cannot stop here. The Heaven Treasure Stronghold was plotting an assassination. They have to be punished as well. Speak with Grandmother.</font>
