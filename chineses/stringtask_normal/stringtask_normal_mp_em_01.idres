completemenu_40039=Cui Yiluan stands by the laws of the Emei. Despite her own judgment, you are not held responsible for Ximen's actions.
completemenu_40040=Ximen Fengliu is to pay for his crimes.

completemenu_40042=I am at your mercy.
completemenu_40043=Ximen Lengliu is leaving. He does not wish to return to Wanderer's Valley.
accept_40001_1=Welcome back. When you are rested, please speak with your sister, Zhen Xu.
accept_40002_1=If you're looking for Aunt Shuijing, she's at her sanctuary just down the hill, taking care of the local orphans. We made some toy swords for the children. Why don’t you bring those to them?
accept_40003_1=Sister Shan Er is feeling homesick. She misses her mom.
accept_40004_1=It's Grandma Shuijing, naturally! She burns it in every room.
accept_40005_1=Actually, there is. Would you be so kind as to gather some pollen and dew for me?
accept_40006_1=I am…what? How dare you say that to me?
accept_40007_1=That way! They haven't gone far!
accept_40008_1=So it's just you? I'd call it beginner's luck. Those bandits wouldn't stand a chance against us, the Order of the Lotus.
accept_40009_1=Be careful. You were good back there, I admit, but beginner's luck can only go so far.
accept_40013_1=I wish I could get a good look at those bastards. Who could they be?
accept_40014_1=Have you found that necklace?
accept_40015_1=
accept_40017_1=May I ask you one last favor? Can you bring me to Sister Feng Shu? I'm still feeling a little dizzy.
accept_40018_1=Yes. I saw a man running towards the temple grounds. Now that we the Lotus Order sisters are here, he'll never get away!
accept_40019_1=I should keep looking for clues.
accept_40025_1=I have been a fool all these years. No, I will not keep this a secret anymore. I can only pray that I will be forgiven.
accept_40026_1=Shuijing is one of us, and she is a saint when it comes to caring for the orphans and the ill. Does that justify clemency for her son?
accept_40027_1=The Order of the Lotus sisters are eager to exact vengeance against Ximen Fengliu. Tell Sister Hua to retrain them while I consider my judgment.
accept_40028_1=You don't frighten me. You call me a spy, even a philanderer, but there are those among you who actually welcomed me to their lonely beds!
accept_40029_1=Thank you. You may think me foolish, but I have made him some soup. Would you bring it with you when you speak to him?
accept_40030_1=Very well. I will do as you ask.
accept_40031_1=I understand. Ha, what are the odds, eh? That I would be sent to steal information from the School where my mother has been all these years?
accept_40038_1=Why should I? You're going to kill me anyway.
accept_40040_1=I would gladly die to give my son another chance!
accept_40042_1=Thank you for all you have done for us.
accept_40043_1=As for you, let the records show that you are formally reprimanded for disobeying the laws of Emei. For your pivotal role in reuniting mother and son, the customary penalties of excommunication and banishment are suspended.
complete_40001=So you're the new girl. Pleased to meet you! Oh, don’t take Cui Yiluan seriously. She always thinks she and her order are better than everyone else.
complete_40002=I dunno…
complete_40003=I feel sleepy. Nap time…
complete_40004=Perhaps some other time. There's so much I have to do. We will speak more when I am more rested.
complete_40005=Thank you, that'll be enough.
complete_40006=Two masked bandits kidnapped Xie Zhixiang! Go after them!
complete_40007=The sisters are safe. Nice work!
complete_40008=Good hunting, sister.
complete_40009=I'm bleeding. Can you help?
complete_40013=Perhaps. There is one other thing you should know. One of the men attacking me ran off before you arrived, but not before I tore off his necklace. It should still be on the ground around here.
complete_40014=
complete_40015=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thank you. That pouch belongs to me.</font>
complete_40016=This is a Long-Life Locket. Mothers sometimes give them to their children. Why does this grown man have one?
complete_40017=I'm glad to see that she is safe.
complete_40018=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Where did you find this? Where is the man who was wearing this necklace? Tell me he is alive!</font>
complete_40019=Hmm. This is a Long-Life Locket. Mothers sometimes give them to their children. Why does this man have one?
complete_40025=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thus we have a conflict between justice and compassion. Will you advise me?</font>
complete_40026=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" ></font><font face="Default" color="#8fd6ef" >Shuijing gave birth to that fiend? Are you sure about that?</font>
complete_40027=Oh, did those poor girls die from their wounds? What a shame.
complete_40028=You are bleeding. What happened?
complete_40029=These are pacification herbs! Do you want my son to sleep through his own execution?
complete_40030=I…thank you.
complete_40031=You! You injured several of your own sisters to protect a spy!
complete_40037=Ow. All right. You win that round.
complete_40038=I heard what happened. Well fought, novice. Tell Abbess Shuijing what kind of man her son is.
complete_40039=I am not surprised. What must I do to spare my son?
complete_40041=Finally, Fengliu knows the truth. I am unmoved, child. Let them kill me in my place.
complete_40042=In light of Ximen Fengliu's repentance, and in observation of the belated reunion of mother and son, Ximen Fengliu's sentence of death is thereby commuted, but he shall be forever banished from Mount Emei. Treat his wounds, then send him on his way.
complete_40043=So, Ximen Fengliu is leaving Wanderer's Valley. You have done well.
