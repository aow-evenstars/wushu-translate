context_55001=We recently examined the temple of Wooden Monk Lane. The elder guardians of the temple wished to speak with me about the treasure.
context_55002=The monks at the Wooden Monk Lane may be involved with the theft of the treasure. Start your investigation discreetly with the local villagers.
context_55003=After talking with the locals, I learned that the only person who regularly goes in and out of Wooden Monk Lane is Zu Zhen, who is now our person of interest.
context_55004=Xuan Jie gave me a background on Zu Zhen.
context_55005=There has been no news of Elder Zu Zhen for six years. How can this be?
context_55006=Confirm that he was once a resident of Yuyao Village. They must have a registry.
context_55007=I just received a letter from the authorities, who denied sending me a letter. Why?
context_55008=Why does the registry book of Yuyao Village look so new, when it is said to be centuries old? Go take another look.
context_55009=Listen to the plan of Master Xuan Jie.
context_55010=Have Master Xuan Jie disguise you as Zu Zhen, then follow his instructions.
context_55011=Infiltrate Yuyao Village.
context_55012=Report what you learned about the false Zu Zhen. Be prepared for anything.
context_55013=It does not matter that the Blade Sharpening Hall was behind it all. The treasure must still be recovered.
context_55020=The Shaolin will not leave the challenge of the Blade Sharpening Hall unanswered. We will flush them out of their hideouts.
context_55021=The injured disciple may tell me something about the thief who stole the treasure.
context_55022=The poisoner had left a trace at the scene of the crime.
context_55023=I must catch up to the murderer at the Snake Mountain.
context_55024=I will ask the locals whether they spotted the coward who laid the trap for me.
context_55025=I did not expect to meet the mute servant at the Wooden Monk Lane.
context_55026=The fire appeared without warning. I will investigate the burn site.
context_55027=I will ask the Shaolin abbot for advice. Those disciples must not die in vain!
context_55030=The truth has come to light regarding Zu Zhen. We have discovered several secret bases of the Blade Sharpening Hall. Every one of these bases is guarded by highly skilled fighters.
context_55031=The truth has come to light regarding Xuan Zhen. We have discovered several secret bases of the Blade Sharpening Hall. Every one of these bases is guarded by highly skilled fighters.
context_55032=Follow the lead from Tan Shaoang. Wipe out the secret base of the Blade Sharpening Hall.
context_55033=The truth has come to light regarding Wuma Guijun. We have discovered several secret bases of the Blade Sharpening Hall. Every one of these bases is guarded by highly skilled fighters.
context_55034=The truth has come to light regarding Ye Qiannian. We have discovered several secret bases of the Blade Sharpening Hall. Every one of these bases is guarded by highly skilled fighters.
context_55035=You are hereby ordered to wipe out all remnant forces of the Blade Sharpening Hall.
context_55036=The Dog Staff may have been recovered, but the Blade Sharpening Hall is still at large among the eight Schools. Beware, their bases are guarded by highly skilled fighters.
context_55037=A secret base of the Blade Sharpening Hall has been found. It must be wiped out!
context_55038=Saving Ding Jiuzhong had major consequences. Displeased, the emperor sent a messenger to Tangmen to announce an imperial decree. Ask the Headmaster about the decree.
context_55039=A messenger pigeon suddenly arrives. It's a letter from the Four Great Outlaws, asking for help.
context_55040=Return to Shaolin. Ask the Abbot about what happened long ago.
