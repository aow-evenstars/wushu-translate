completemenu_46023=Leader Xia, Mr. Yanbing let me protect you.
completemenu_46024=Leader Xia, are you alright?
completemenu_46025=Leader Xia, hold on!
completemenu_46026=Headmaster, Leader Xia has died. He obliged me to ask whether Sister Xia is his long missing sister before his death.

completemenu_46045=Elder Martial Sister Xia, this is Young master Dong's family jade plate.
completemenu_46046=Young Master Dong, do you feel better now? Elder Martial Sister Xia asked me to give you this letter.
completemenu_46047=Elder Martial Sister Xia, Young Master Dong left in despair after reading the letter.

accept_46001_1=<s>I was given this delicate dancing dress the other day. Please give it to Elder Sister Xia Yanhu for me, ok?
accept_46002_1=<s>Oh? Go to ask Yun Xiangyi what happened. Since they're sisters and always together, so she must know it.
accept_46003_1=<s>A disciple reported to me that a man named Dong Yunbo wanted to see your Elder Martial Sister Xia at the gate, but she refused to see him. They are in love.
accept_46005_1=<s>They are from the Tripod Clan. They are coming after me, it is probably better for you to leave now, Young Hero.
accept_46006_1=<s>Thank you for helping me. Wounds can be cured and a broken heart can be mended.

accept_46013_1=<s>Pooh! Show off in front of me?
accept_46014_1=<s>Young Hero, I'm afraid that you will be in danger if you get involved. People from Thunderbolt Hall will be coming after you.
accept_46015_1=<s>The leader of the Thunderbolt Hall, Xue Honglie, is visiting your School now. Can you ask him for the antidote for me, Young Hero?
accept_46016_1=<s>I've assigned someone to ask Xue Honglie. You can report to the Headmaster to see if he has any good ideas.
accept_46017_1=<s>I am afraid the situation is worse than it seems.
accept_46018_1=<s>One of our disciples offended Xue Honglie a few days ago. I've written this letter, do you mind sending it to him for me?
accept_46021_1=<s>How dare you make such accusations! You have no proof! We Thunderbolt Hall get along with Wanderer's Valley, but we are not part of them in any sort. Ask Lu Yunxiao, he will say the same thing to you.

accept_46031_1=<s>Young Hero, Zhang Chi is coming. Be careful!
accept_46032_1=<s>I've noticed something strange.
accept_46033_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Lu Yunxiao seems like a suspect for this. Several disciples noticed that he visited Xue Honglie frequently. I think he is the hand behind this plot.</font>
accept_46034_1=<s>You were lucky didn’t get killed. But now you'll end up just like Xia Wuyou.
accept_46036_1=<s>And keep talking to me. I don't mind the time, but I am sure some other people don't have much time left.
accept_46037_1=<s>Help Dong Yunbo. I will ask other Brothers and Sisters to help.
accept_46038_1=<s>I know how the poison works. What Dong Yunbo has in him seems to be some kind of poison from insects. We need to repress the poison as soon as possible. Collect some Insect Palpus Herb the garden outside and we can make the medicine.
accept_46039_1=<s>Grind these herbs and take them to Dong Yunbo soon.
accept_46042_1=<s>Dong Yunbo is cured, but he is still very weak, so don't say too much. Give him the sword.
accept_46043_1=<s>I get it, you are conspiring together and try to drive me off from here, aren't you? I will not believe a word of any nonsense you said.

accept_46050_1=OK. I haven't admired paintings or plum blossoms for a long time. Let's go.
complete_46001=<s>Ah? What happened?
complete_46002=<s>My sister? It's Dong Yunbo's fault, ask Yanbing!

complete_46007=<s>Oh, really?
complete_46008=<s>I can hear some very complicated emotion in this music. I think it reflects how she felt recently.
complete_46009=<s>Sister Xia is very stubborn. But if anything happens to Dong Yunbo, she will regret for it for a long time. I will send someone to help now.
complete_46010=<s>You must have pretty good skills in order to defeat our people.
complete_46013=<s>Young Hero, please spare my life! I was forced to do it, by the Thunderbolt Hall!
complete_46014=<s>If we can't get the antidote, everyone in the Tripod Clan is going to get killed?
complete_46015=<s>There has been no rumor about hates between the Thunderbolt Hall and the Tripod Clan. The poison incident is no doubt that Thunderbolt Hall is planning on something. But until we are clear on the relationship between these three groups, we cannot jump into any conclusion.
complete_46016=<s>Oh, the Thunderbolt Hall and the Tripod are in peace with each other. Why would the Thunderbolt poison and force them?
complete_46017=<s>These are just guesses. We can't jump to conclusion just yet.
complete_46018=<s>I don't have time for playing around, just say your question.
complete_46020=<s>You've arrived.
complete_46021=<s>That is nonsense.
complete_46022=<s>Really? You were attacked inside the Scholars? Then they are probably having some really important secret that they really want to hide from. But if your attackers aren't of the Thunderbolt Hall, there must be another sect involved.
complete_46023=<s>Ah! I am so silly and don't see through the little trick of Wanderer's Valley. Wanderer's Valley is behind Thunderbolt Hall's attack against our Giant Tripod Sect.
complete_46024=<s>I'm deeply poisoned and will die soon. I think you have good martial skills. I have something to ask from you or I'll die with a grievance.
complete_46025=<s>With your help, I think I can finally die in peace. Thank you.
complete_46026=<s>We scholars do not get involved in the feuds of Jianghu. Xia Yanhu was adopted by my Shifu who was entrusted by Bu Yanyu. I don’t think she is Xia Wuyou's long missing sister.
complete_46027=<s>Although the Scholars do not interfere with the matters of Jianghu, we cannot ignore this any longer. Xia Wuyou wrongly died in front of our gates.
complete_46028=<s>It is you! It is all your fault! The great Tripod Clan will never forgive you Scholars!
complete_46029=<s>Stop giving me excuses! It's all your fault! Otherwise, we would have already killed Dong Yunbo and get the antidote already.
complete_46030=<s>(Cough) No… (Cough).
complete_46031=<s>These are just some bruises. Thank you for your help, again, Young Hero. How can I ever thank you, after all you have done for me?
complete_46032=<s>What news have you got, Young Hero?
complete_46033=<s>What do you want?
complete_46034=<s>I defeated me just because you were lucky.

complete_46039=<s>(Cough) I don’t know how to thank you for all you've done for me, Young Hero.

complete_46049=Quickly, invite him here.
context_46001=<s>A few days ago, the Headmaster got a piece of exquisite dance clothes by chance. The Headmaster asks me to send it to Elder Martial Sister Xia Yanhu.
context_46002=<s>Mr. Yanbing told me that Yun Xiangyi and Xia Yanhu are always together. Go to inquire them.
context_46003=<s>Mr. Yanbing told me the history between Elder Martial Sister Xia and Dong Yunbo. He asked me to try to persuade him to leave here.
context_46005=<s>The Tripod Clan are here for revenge. I must protect Dong Yunbo and help him defeats the enemies.
context_46006=<s>Dong Yunbo gives me a Folding Fan which was presented by Xia Yanhu at that time. He asks me to give it back to Elder Martial Sister Xia Yanhu and hopes Elder Martial Sister Xia can come out to meet him for their relationship.
context_46007=<s>Dong Yunbo writes down Leader Master's name on the Folding Fan and then give the Folding Fan to Master.
context_46008=<s>Elder Sister Xia asked me to give her new composition to Elder Sister Hua Caiyi.
context_46009=<s>Elder Sister Hua Caiyi should be informed of Dong Yunbo's injury.
context_46010=<s>I went to help Dong Yunbo willingly. He asked me to check about the action of Xia Wuyou.
context_46013=<s>Xia Wuyou noticed that Zhang Chi was inferior to me then he beat him by himself.
context_46014=<s>Xia Wuyou spoke out how things happened. Thunderbolt Hall forced Giant Tripod Sect to fight against Sanqing Sword.
context_46016=<s>Shi Yanbing has sent someone to ask Xue Honglie. You go to report The Leader and ask him if he has any methods.
context_46017=<s>Xiao Bieqing thinks this matter is strange and doubts the backstage organizer is Wanderer's Valley. But there is no evidence, so it's hard to infer.
context_46018=<s>Ask Xue Honglie about the relationship between the Thunderbolt Hall and Wanderer's Valley.
context_46020=<s>Go to protect Dong Yunbo.
context_46021=<s>Speak to Lu Yunxiao of Wanderer's Valley.
context_46022=<s>The issues of the Thunderbolt Hall have nothing to do with us Wanderer's Valley.
context_46023=<s>I'm afraid the Wanderer's Valley has decided to kill those who know the truth. Go to help these people soon.
context_46024=<s>Xia Wuyou told me that he just got the news that Wanderer's Valley had dispatched some killer to assassinate him. I helped to repel the invading enemies.
context_46025=<s>Please help Xia Wuyou check if she is his elder sister or not.
context_46026=<s>Xia Wuyou stopped his breathing. You go to consult the Leader about Xia Yanhu and Xia Wuyou's relationship.
context_46027=<s>Xia Wuyou is dead, this is a big event. The Leader asked me to use the carrier pigeon to deliver this message to Giant Tripod Sect.
context_46028=<s>Someone reported just now that there were men shouting curses and making troubles at the front gate. The Headmaster sent me to have a look.
context_46029=<s>I explained to Zhang Chi repeatedly, but he didn't listen to me and threatened that he wouldn't give up.
context_46030=Zhang Chi refused to listen and threatened that he will not give up. You must report it to the Headmaster right now and ask him to make decision.
context_46031=<s>Zhang Chi rushed with anger filled up his bosom. Don't let him hurt Dong Yunbo!
context_46032=<s>Dong Yunbo thinks this matter is very strange and wants to know the explanation.
context_46033=<s>There is no doubt that the backstage envoy sent by Wanderer's Valley is Xue Honglie. And Mr. Shi Yanbing asks me go ahead to capture Lu Yunxiao.
context_46034=<s>Lu Yunxiao asks his follower to morganize me. Go to defeat him. Lu Yunxiao wants to kill me by himself. Go to defeat him as well.
context_46036=<s>I was tricked by Wanderer's Valley's distraction display. Now Wanderer's Valley's killers must have gone to look for Dong Yunbo. I decided to protect him. I passed by the Headmaster's study on my way. So I went inside to report this to the Headmaster.
context_46037=<s>The Headmaster Xiao Bieqing asked me to protect Dong Yunbo and then gathered other martial brothers and sisters to help me.
context_46038=<s>Elder Martial Sister Dai concludes that Dong Yunbo should be poisoned by Hundred Insects poison, which is refined by the venom of a hundred poisonous insects. And its poisonousness is extremely severe. The poisonousness must be restricted as soon as possible. The insect palpus herb of Scholar is a must to make antidote. Go to collect some.
context_46039=<s>Grind these herbs and take them to Dong Yunbo soon.
context_46042=<s>Tell the truth to Dong Yunbo that he and Xia Yanhu are full sister and brother.
context_46043=<s>Dong Yunbo dare not face the fact and laughs crazily, saying that Scholar disciples cheat him together. He attacks the main role crazily.
context_46044=<s>Dong Yunbo knows the truth and then loses heart. He becomes mad. I must tell Elder Martial Sister Xia about this.
context_46045=<s>Tell the truth to Elder Martial Sister Xia that she and Dong Yunbo are full sister and brother.
context_46046=<s>Elder Martial Sister Xia cried and wrote a letter. She asked me to give this letter to Dong Yunbo.
context_46047=<s>Dong Yunbo wants to commit suicide for several times after reading the letter. After being comforted, he leaves sadly.
context_46048=<s>It's a tragedy. Elder Martial Sister Xia Yanhu and Dong Yunbo are elder sister and younger brother. Elder Martial Sister Xia is very sad. She decides to remain unmarried all her life.
context_46049=<s>Both plum blossom and snowflake all think that they are the most beautiful one in Spring. It is hard for poets to judge which one of them is more beautiful. Because snowflake is whiter than plum blossom but plum blossom has fragrance which snowflake doesn't have.
