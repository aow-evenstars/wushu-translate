complete_85079=<s>OK. Thank you.
complete_85080=<s>Okay, I see. We must hurry up. I'm sending disciples there now.
complete_85081=<s>Even though she is not bad at martial arts, she still need improvement in various aspects. I have my reasons to not let her participate. If she feels upset, I will send people to explain to her.
complete_85082=<s>Really? She really says so? I was so upset. Now I am relieved. Thank you very much!
complete_85083=<s>I've told them many times that cultivation takes time. But they never listen. Okay. I will prepare and set out.
complete_85084=<s>Really? I knew she can do it. But I didn't expect her to be so quick. Okay. I will go find her now. Thank you!
complete_85085=<s>It's much better now. Who did it? It's so evil. Emei rarely has any enemies in Jianghu.
complete_85086=<s>So forgetful! It's the wine we drank on the first day we met. On that day...
