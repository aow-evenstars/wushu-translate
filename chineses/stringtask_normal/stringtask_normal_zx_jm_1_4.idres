CanAcceptMenu_28077=Huh, I won't go. I will investigate the matter personally!
CanAcceptMenu_28078=Leader Xiao, thank you for your generosity. It was just because...
CanAcceptMenu_28079=What! The person from Wudang did this?
CanAcceptMenu_28084=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You've slaughtered them...they're just guards!</font>
CanAcceptMenu_28085=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What is that sword in your hands?</font>
CanAcceptMenu_28086=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Stand down, my lord. Let's talk.</font>
CanAcceptMenu_28087=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I must say, you and your granddaughter thrive on chaos.</font>
CanAcceptMenu_28088=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We have to get to the Sword Forge!</font>
CanAcceptMenu_28089=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >They're inside!</font>
CanAcceptMenu_28090=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You wanted me to kill him…so why didn't you help me?</font>
CanAcceptMenu_28099=I advise you to hand over the weaponry quickly, or you will suffer from pain.
CanAcceptMenu_28100=Shut up! Hand over the things!
CanAcceptMenu_28111=I don't know...
CanAcceptMenu_28112=No. If you exert yourself, you can defeat me within 10 moves.
CanAcceptMenu_28113=Indeed there is a very important thing. Here is the thing...
CanAcceptMenu_28114=I see Taoist is very worried, but I don't know why.
CanAcceptMenu_28115=Taoist Wang Shaojie asks me to look for you. You are hurt by Philanderer.
CanAcceptMenu_28121=Taoist, don’t say that. And I can deal with the Philanderer.
CanAcceptMenu_28122=Who are the bad guys? Philanderer?
CanAcceptMenu_28123=You can't judge me by appearance alone. My martial arts are also very good!
CanAcceptMenu_28124=Have you seen him?
CanAcceptMenu_28125=That lecher again? Did he do anything to you?
CanAcceptMenu_28126=Why are you doing this for such an important matter. Believe it or not, I will beat you!
CanAcceptMenu_28127=I have picked fruits for you. So now you can tell me about it.
CanAcceptMenu_28128=Lech, you are such sinful, today I must send you to Yamen!
CanAcceptMenu_28133=What a joke! If I could forgive you, I would not come to find you today!
CanAcceptMenu_28134=Calm down. He has committed heinous crimes, but he must be dealt with by the police!
CanAcceptMenu_28135=What wretch? Is there someone making trouble in the village?
CanAcceptMenu_28136=It's my pleasure.
CanAcceptMenu_28137=This village has thieves?
CanAcceptMenu_28138=Your mother is old. You haven't repaid her kindness and even...
CanAcceptMenu_28139=Tell me, why are you set an ambush with so many people?
CanAcceptMenu_28145=Don't worry, aunt. Your son will take care of you. I have important things to do...
CanAcceptMenu_28146=Qi suggested I look for you and that you know a lot.
CanAcceptMenu_28147=Tell me what sword has been gotten by that Devil's Gate.
CanAcceptMenu_28148=What's wrong? Whichever is the school of this Devil's Gate?
CanAcceptMenu_28149=Shut up! Or I'll kill you!
CanAcceptMenu_28150=Don't worry. I've decided to look for them first.
CanAcceptMenu_28151=This brother must be the doorkeeper of Devil's Gate.
CanAcceptMenu_28152=I really admire elder, and with Devil's Gate you could do whatever you like. So I came especially to join Devil's Gate!
CanAcceptMenu_28153=You only played thirty percent skills. I extremely admire your skill, predecessor!
CanAcceptMenu_28154=The elder is an alcoholic. Now can I join in the Devil's Gate?
CanAcceptMenu_28157=I want to join in the Devil's Gate but the alcoholic elder said I need to pass the tests first!
CanAcceptMenu_28158=Did I pass your test?
CanAcceptMenu_28159=It's great you like it, predecessor. I have heard you know a lot about eating...
CanAcceptMenu_28160=I've heard a lot about Devil's Gate for a long time and I would like to be a member of Devil's Gate, before...
CanAcceptMenu_28161=How dare I am. I am even afraid of looking what's inside.
CanAcceptMenu_28162=Well, how's your tolerance for alcohol?
CanAcceptMenu_28163=The Hungry Ghost brother is cooking. How about joining them to drink and eat?
CanAcceptMenu_28164=I had a bet with elder brother but you lost. You should be punished!
CanAcceptMenu_28165=There's no need to drink wine or eat food!
CanAcceptMenu_28166=In this case, I'll take another jar of wine!
CanAcceptMenu_28169=How could you say that? How would I... if you didn't bring me here?
CanAcceptMenu_28170=How could you say that? We're on the same side! Well, have you got the sword?
CanAcceptMenu_28171=I didn't see him since I come back. Maybe he is cooking something delicious.
CanAcceptMenu_28172=Big brother, you're right. I am leaving first. I'll see whether the hungry ghost brother has come back or not.
CanAcceptMenu_28173=You treat unjustly on me without any evidences. In any case, I'm your sixth master.
CanAcceptMenu_28174=Some hidden traitor killed Hungry Ghost brother. You should stay here. Don't let anybody out!
CanAcceptMenu_28181=I killed these three guys and I completely ignored other minions!
CanAcceptMenu_28182=Thank you!
CanAcceptMenu_28183=I have something urgent and need rush to Wudang. I hope we could meet again!
CanAcceptMenu_28184=Why do you look sad, Immortal?
CanAcceptMenu_28185=Ah, no, I was upset that I did not identify the authenticity of the Tai Chi Sword...
CanAcceptMenu_28186=It's really a shame. I promised to find the Tai Chi Sword...

CompleteMenu_28111=I just know you're letting me win.
CompleteMenu_28112=Meet Immortal Ziyang!
CompleteMenu_28113=Hi, Taoist. Immortal Ziyang allows me to select a useful weapon here.
CompleteMenu_28114=Taoist, are you Liu Yulong? Apply the hemostasis herb on the wound first.
CompleteMenu_28115=I have subdued those wandering bandits, Taoist, you could rest assured.
CompleteMenu_28121=Little brother, you seem unhappy.
CompleteMenu_28122=Are you Old man Liu? I'm here to help villagers catch the Philanderer...
CompleteMenu_28123=What are you thinking, do you believe me now?
CompleteMenu_28124=Girl, what happened?
CompleteMenu_28125=Did you see a person running past here?
CompleteMenu_28126=Fruits, here you are!
CompleteMenu_28127=Huh, at last I find you!
CompleteMenu_28128=Your martial arts are average at best. You're barely strong enough to take on those scrawny civilians!
CompleteMenu_28133=I have caught him.
CompleteMenu_28134=Are you Geng? Old Liu wants you to know the lecher has been caught.
CompleteMenu_28135=I can assure you that these thugs will not cause any more trouble.
CompleteMenu_28136=Elder Qi, this is the jade bracelet you left with Elder Geng.
CompleteMenu_28137=Are you Yang Yao, the son of Aunt Qi? Go back and don’t gamble any more!
CompleteMenu_28138=Do you want to fight with me, too?
CompleteMenu_28139=Elder Qi, your son has changed. He wants to take care of you now.
CompleteMenu_28145=Are you Li Ahua?
CompleteMenu_28146=Look, this is the snake gall. Those snakes are very fierce!
CompleteMenu_28147=Is Devil's Gate nearby?
CompleteMenu_28148=Oh, didn't you eat anything?. Why are you so listless by just a few acts?
CompleteMenu_28149=I have returned the cattle for you.
CompleteMenu_28150=The Devil's Gate deserves its reputation.
CompleteMenu_28151=Alcoholic predecessor is indeed worthy his reputation!
CompleteMenu_28152=The elder is very powerful.
CompleteMenu_28153=Predecessor, look!
CompleteMenu_28154=You must be Bad Gambler Predecessor, nice to meet you!
CompleteMenu_28157=Predecessor, is this that jade plate?
CompleteMenu_28158=Hungry ghost elder, these are the gifts for you. Recommended by several elders, we come here to be tested.
CompleteMenu_28159=It's an honor to see such a wealthy man!
CompleteMenu_28160=Predecessor, look! Is this that package?
CompleteMenu_28161=Have you cooked the dishes?

CompleteMenu_28164=Big brother, I'm back!
CompleteMenu_28165=Big brother, you are back.
CompleteMenu_28166=Brother, do you still remember me?
CompleteMenu_28169=Are these Lan Qingmei enough?
CompleteMenu_28170=Big brother, you are here. Did you see the hungry ghost brother?
CompleteMenu_28171=If I have any questions, may I ask you for help?
CompleteMenu_28172=Why are you doing this?
CompleteMenu_28173=Gosh, The world is shaking. Hungry Ghost is killed.
CompleteMenu_28174=It's dangerous here, you need to get out!
CompleteMenu_28181=Is this seven stamen pear flower?
CompleteMenu_28182=You must be a master. What's your name?
CompleteMenu_28183=Immortal, I get back Tai Chi Sword!
CompleteMenu_28184=The herbalist said that what you see is not always what you get.
CompleteMenu_28185=Predecessor, Immortal Ziyang asks me to give you this fake Tai Chi Sword. Here is the thing...
CompleteMenu_28186=Immortal, do you know other news about Tai Chi Sword?
accept_28001_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">Oh...</font>

accept_28003_1=Oh don't thank me. You just remind me of my grandson. Now eat your food while it's hot.
accept_28004_1=Work you say? You are just in time! We have a bag of rice that needs to be delivered right away. Take it to the Inn.
accept_28005_1=I do not know too many people around these parts. Ask the Innkeeper, he knows all about the folks that come and go around here.
accept_28006_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I might know something about that... but such information will require a favor. Gather some firewood and give it to Gao Xiaoer.

For the next month, you will endure strength training to get you into proper shape. Carry ten buckets of water every day without spilling a single drop, then carry ten bundles of firewood. If you cannot do this, you have no place here.</font>

complete_28100=In ten years, this is the first time I've come across something like this... As a reward, you can select any weapon you wish among them.
complete_28111=<s>It's so rare to see people so young with such great martial arts skills!
complete_28112=<s>What would like me to do?
complete_28113=<s>OK, I have some here for you to choose...

complete_28121=<s>I want to beat the baddie to death and kill him...
complete_28122=You? Forget it. I appreciate your kindness. But that lech is good at martial arts. I asked several strong men and they couldn't defeat him. Now only you...
complete_28123=<s>Whoops! I can't believe you are so young but with so great talents! What an idiot I am!
complete_28124=That lech......
complete_28125=<s>Are you looking for the lecher? I know where he is, but I won't tell you anything until you get me some fruit!
complete_28126=<s>This looks quite delicious. Thank you so much!
complete_28127=<s>Who, who are you?
complete_28128=<s>You! Whoops, I have been seriously injured by you and could not do bad things again, please spare me!
complete_28133=<s>Finally, peace has been restored to the village! For good measure, I should have all the villagers beat that bastard thief to death for all that he's done!
complete_28134=<s>Really? I will deal with that lecher later.
complete_28135=<s>You have helped us so much... You are truly our village's savior!
complete_28136=Thank you so much! I spent all day looking for that bracelet! Now I'll go hide it quickly...
complete_28137=<s>Who the hell are you? And my winnings are none of your damn business
complete_28138=Very good! No, how can I beat you. Just take this guy away and pretend not to see me!
complete_28139=Thank you so very much! Let's hope that he won't cause trouble again...
complete_28145=<s>Yes, it appears you are a martial artist. What do you need from me?
complete_28146=<s>Hopefully this snake gall will cure me!
complete_28147=<s>Stop mentioning that Devil's Gate. A group of miserable wretches!
complete_28148=<s>I, I just stepped on cow dung and distracted. You know I emphasize cleanliness the most...
complete_28149=<s> Oh, I had no idea that you offended them. They will definitely make revenge on you, so in my opinion, you’d better leave!
complete_28150=<s>What are you doing here?
complete_28151=Who are you? How do you come in?
complete_28152=<s>You would have lost if I hadn't been holding back!
complete_28153=<s>Good, there is nothing left! But your capacity for liquor needs to be improved. I can drink three jars of this wine in a breath.
complete_28154=<s>You do have good eyes. Who are you and what do you want me to do?
complete_28157=<s>Yes, this is in fact the jade plate. You found it so quickly!
complete_28158=<s>It's been days since I ate venison.
complete_28159=Knock off these formulaes. Who are you? And what are you doing?
complete_28160=<s>Yes! This is that package! You didn't take anything, did you?
complete_28161=<s>How can such delicious food be cooked in such a short time!? Just a few more minutes...
complete_28162=<s>I know you can! Come, let's drink even more!
complete_28163=<s>Why do you serve me the drink for no reason at all?
complete_28164=<s>So slow, and where is the wine you fetch?
complete_28165=<s>Did Hungry Ghost say for me to hurry up? Tell him I need more time.
complete_28166=<s>Of course, I still remember! Now we have call you Liu Ye from now on!
complete_28169=<s>Am I bothering you?
complete_28170=<s>We haven't met him. Didn't you drink and eat meat together?
complete_28171=<s>We're brothers, not complete strangers!
complete_28172=<s>You have killed our brother, still pretend to be ignorant?
complete_28173=<s>What! What's wrong?
complete_28174=<s>Take good care of yourself first, young one!
complete_28181=<s>Yes. This drug will be poisonous if it is eaten alone. The poison you get can be removed with this poison by using poison as antidotes.
complete_28182=<s>I'm just a herbalist.
complete_28183=<s>Really? Let me see!
complete_28184=<s>What are you saying?
complete_28185=<s>You put yourself in great danger dealing with Devil's Gate. For that, I can't thank you enough.
complete_28186=<s>I still haven't received any news from the disciples I sent out.
context_28001=<s>I have wandered day and night to find Old Man Lucky mentioned by my father since other members of my family were murdered and my Younger Brother got lost. I lived outdoor everyday. Finally I arrived to Jiming Posthouse.
context_28002=<s>The beggar girl received some compassion.
context_28003=<s>This old lady bought me food out of the kindness of her heart. She reminds me of my mother... It hurts to think about my family…
context_28004=<s> The kind old woman suggested I find work at Shopkeeper Qin's General Store.
context_28005=<s>I need to ask the Innkeeper about Old Man Lucky.
context_28006=<s>The Innkeeper may know where Old Man Lucky is but I must fulfill his task first. Better I do what he wants and get it over with.
context_28007=<s>A guest is too drunk yet demands more wine. The waiter has asked me to persuade the guest to stop drinking.
context_28008=<s>The Innkeeper doesn't know where Old Man Lucky is, but he tells me that his brother-in-law, Du Shifu might night. He's probably at the Martial Arts School.
context_28009=<s>I finally found Old Man Lucky's location. Although it is said Old Man Lucky is cold and never takes in disciples, I still have to try.
context_28010=<s>Old Man Lucky finally agreed. Meet with A-si.
context_28013=Received an exquisite sword from Pang Qingwen before going back to Old Man Lucky for a new task.
context_28014=<s>Old Man Lucky has tasked me to strengthen my body by gathering firewood and carrying buckets of water.
context_28015=<s>Old Man Lucky said that an essential point of practicing Kung Fu was making use of one's environment. I need to learn more about this.
context_28016=<s>I have learned to use the environment to my advantage, though I was reprimanded for my arrogance.
context_28017=<s>The move of martial arts focuses on acting from the inner heart, and the highest level is that no move surpasses acts. I hope you can get it some day. Now, you visit the martial club and fight against with my disciples to experience subtleties of different moves with your own body.
context_28018=<s>Ghost Tears says that it takes a decade to master striking ones vital point. I feel I'm really too eager for results.

context_28029=<s>Head to Apricot Blossom Village to inquire about Evil Tiger Mountain Stronghold.
context_28030=<s>A-Si told me that powerful outsiders can hardly afford to neglect local bullies, so be tolerant in everything in the future. There is too much injustice in the world for you to handle. Then he asked me to collect some herbs which can be used to make medicinal wine so as to increase strength and marital art skills.

context_28042=<s>Old Man Lucky's words quell the urge for unnecessary combat.
context_28043=<s> The villagers could not be helped at this time. Xiong Zhuang was still belligerent and needed another beating.
context_28044=<s>After leaving Apricot Blossom Village, I went to the Evil Tiger Mountain Stronghold alone and met a head of the stronghold.
context_28045=<s>I went to Dragon Pool alone, unexpectedly encounter Ghost Tears who seeks amusement through slaughter, and then simply killed Evil Tiger Mountain Stronghold with him.

context_28077=<s>Look at your seriousness, I would almost believe you. The leader didn't deal with you, but if you still do not keep on the rails, we Beggar's Sect brothers would drown you boy by everyone's spittle!
context_28078=<s> I understand, but you don't need to be rude.
context_28079=<s>I thoroughly thought and believed the event was suspicious

context_28112=<s>Well, now that you're the disciple of Old Man Lucky, and this matter is so important, I allow you to go to find Headmaster. He is in the hall.
context_28113=<s>What! How can this happen? Didn't Leader Xiao find other suspicious details? If Deputy Leader Hong is killed by Wudang Tai Chi Sword, it is troublesome!
context_28114=<s>A bandit is preying on the people of Taiping Village near the foot of the mountain, and my friend Liu is hunting him. Can you help?
context_28115=<s>I thought that my martial arts had improved from training in Wudang, but I failed to catch a lecher and deal with some bandits...
context_28121=<s>You should bring that lecher to justice! Talk to Old Man Liu in the village.
context_28122=<s>I screamed to draw everyone's attention to the criminal who bullied our sister. If I was a bit older, I'd have killed him myself!
context_28123=<s>Could you please drive some boars away from the crops?
context_28124=<s>Crimes have been occuring in this village. Everyone guessed that the criminal must be the same person.
context_28125=He would have abducted me. Luckily you were coming. He saw somebody coming, so ran away...
context_28126=<s>My life is terrible. I wouldn't care if you had killed me.
context_28127=To tell you the truth, I am the most trustworthy person. That guy has been hiding there...
context_28128=<s>You are capable that you could find me. But I am marvelous enough daring to be a lech. I beat off some strong men previously. Today how could you defeat me by yourself?
context_28133=<s>Oh, no. I swear, I swear not to do bad things in the future, and I will repent thoroughly of my misdeeds, give up doing evils and return to the just!
context_28134=<s>Tell Old Geng the lecher has been caught.
context_28135=The lecher was caught, but now bandits are stealing our stuff.
context_28136=Can you take this jade bracelet to Elder Qi?
context_28137=I'm not afraid of the thief. It's to guard against my son. My son has grown up, but he just roams around all day, doing nothing. Since he learns to gamble, he goes to gamble once gets money. The things at home are almost all pawned by him. This bracelet is my last fortune.
context_28138=<s>Mind your own business; Brother Qiu and I are going to make a fortune in the town.
context_28139=If I tell you, will you let me go? I knew this man was a gambler and that he had money, so I planned to rob him when no one was around.
context_28145=<s>There is a man name Li Ahua; maybe he can help you.
context_28146=<s>I know a lot of what goes on, but I am often too sick to practice martial arts.
context_28147=<s>My friend suggested it would be a Wudang Sword. The disciples from Devil's Gate treat it as the treasure. But I have not noticed the abnormality of Wudang. I have no idea of its reality...

context_28149=<s>You, you...
context_28150=<s>Oh, don't you want to live? There is no way back once you are here. Why did you go there?
context_28151=<s>How did you boy talk like this? Believe it or not, I would kill you!
context_28152=<s>You must be quite skilled, if you can defeat Duan Jinluo. I'll see if this is true.
context_28153=<s>What a fuss! You are so ignorant! Your martial art is not bad, but just the good martial art is useless. The persons in Devil's Gate are all iron blood men. If you are not good at drinking, you cannot make it. Come to drink this jar of wine!
context_28154=<s> If my four brothers agree to enroll you, your name can be Fatal Ghost!
context_28157=<s> I see. You have to defeat me in terms of "gambling" if you want to pass my test. Don't worry, I won't make things difficult for you. I just hid a piece of jade plate here to make fun of concubine. You will win the game if you find it before a column of incense burns out.
context_28158=<s>Find the lecher.
context_28159=<s>I spend more time eating than sleeping. Naturally, I have high standards.
context_28160=<s>If you could snag a red package from some nearby criminals in East Chamber, I could consider letting you pass.
context_28161=<s>Very good, you boy is quite sensible, just let you muddle through!
context_28162=<s>Bad Gambler gets drunk too easily!
context_28163=<s>Oh, I'm afraid it's not the best time now. I have some business to deal with later. Or you go first and I will find you after finishing it.
context_28164=<s>I deserve punishment, bring me wine!
context_28165=<s> Is there anything important? Just take it easy and eat some food, after all, I have prepared it for a long time!
context_28166=<s>Help yourself when you would like to drink, and take as much as you need!
context_28169=<s>Now we are brothers!
context_28170=<s>Take this treasured sword to the leaders!
context_28171=<s>Yes, definitely! Food is always not enough for this guy! What wine did you drink just now? How are you feeling?
context_28172=<s>OK, I almost finish what I'm doing. I will go to find you soon.
context_28173=<s>Who could it be, besides you?
context_28174=<s>What! Who is that jerk? I will have his fate worse than death! Big brother, don't worry about it. I will firmly guard here, and never let anyone off.
context_28181=<s>I don't mean this. Don't you know you are poisoned?
context_28182=<s> Don't hurry to thank me. Look, those minions are coming like madmen
context_28183=<s>There are some things you cannot see, you just have to believe.
context_28184=<s>Can you tell me how you got the Tai Chi Sword?
context_28185=<s>Please take this sword to Qu Yi from Sword Tomb and ask her to bury it.
context_28186=<s>The headmaster sent many disciples to search for the Tai Chi Sword, but he was heard nothing so far.
