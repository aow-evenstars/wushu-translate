I have heard that Cui Niu was poisoned by venom and I remembered some ancient books that mentioned that Five-Leaves Goldthread Root can cure this poison.  I just happened to have picked some from nearby.   Take it to town and hand it to my younger brother Little Douzi to make up a concoction with the herbs.  I still need to pick some tea leaves and then I too will return to the town.

accept_24036_1=Are you sure you can handle all of them on your own?
accept_24037_1=Wait! I just realized I'm not the only victim here. You saw how those gangsters treated the innkeeper…if I leave now, they'll just turn on him and everyone else in town!

complete_24010_1=It won't be easy. The snakes came from the Tea Forest…
complete_24012=My herbs are having no effect on her. We must get the antidote at the source of the venom.
complete_24012_1=You may not have to go that far. There are snakes gathering just outside this house right now. They must have picked up Cui Niu's scent as she ran home bleeding.
complete_24013=Those vicious snakes! How could I let them hurt Cui Niu?
complete_24013_1=Thank you! Our town is in your debt.
