
CanAcceptMenu_28193=I have destroyed the fake sword.
CanAcceptMenu_28194=Yes, I'm worrying about the negative impact on Wudang.
CanAcceptMenu_28195=It's like this. Several Beggar's Sect disciples are wrangling beneath the mountain, asking to meet Headmaster.
CanAcceptMenu_28196=Thank you, Xiang. Do you know the whereabouts of Tai Chi Sword?
CanAcceptMenu_28197=I was entrusted by Headmaster to find the whereabouts of the Wudang Tai Chi Sword and also to clear myself of grievances.
CanAcceptMenu_28198=Thanks a lot, Taoist. Do you have any news about Tai Chi Sword?
CanAcceptMenu_28199=Gong Chuiyang asked me to drive away the Beggar's Sect disciples at the door. That's how I offended Beggar's Sect. How can I ask them for help?
CanAcceptMenu_28200=But what?
CanAcceptMenu_28201=We must discover the whereabouts of the Tai Chi Sword, and find the murderer of their vice sect leader.
CanAcceptMenu_28202=I am going to meet Immortal Ziyang and explain this.
CanAcceptMenu_28205=Incense Leader Huo are leading Beggar's Sect disciples to go down the mountain with the order of Elder Lu.
CanAcceptMenu_28206=Headmaster also feels very sad about the death of your Sect's Vice Leader. Please carry out investigations on the matter of Tai Chi Sword.
CanAcceptMenu_28207=A Beggar's Sect disciple shouldn't be so insatiable.
CanAcceptMenu_28208=If we do not give those people strict discipline, they will bring very bad impact on Beggar's Sect.
CanAcceptMenu_28209=How come you're still here? Incense Leader Hu?  asked you to go down the mountain immediately.
CanAcceptMenu_28210=Have you found anything new, Incense Leader Huo?
CanAcceptMenu_28211=Follow whose order? Hurry up. No hemming and hawwing.
CanAcceptMenu_28212=Do you have any plans for the future, Incense Leader Huo?
CanAcceptMenu_28213=You are welcome, Immortal. I had to get involved in this fight too for clearing myself of grievances.
CanAcceptMenu_28214=You are absolutely right, Immortal. I am ready to take punishment.
CanAcceptMenu_28217=Do you have any plans for the future, Incense Leader Huo?
CanAcceptMenu_28218=Elder Lu, wake up.
CanAcceptMenu_28219=I do not know why those people want to instigate disputes between Wudang and Beggar's Sect.
CanAcceptMenu_28220=As far as I am concerned, you should strengthen your defense to keep out the schemer.
CanAcceptMenu_28221=Have you finished brewing the hundred flavor wine, Xiang?
CanAcceptMenu_28222=Thank you, Xiang. I have heard that swordsman Heaven Dust is truly a champion. Seeing is believing.
CanAcceptMenu_28223=I want you to teach me some simple skills of the Heaven Dust Sword so that I may protect myself.
CanAcceptMenu_28229=But what...Please feel free to say whatever you like, Taoist.
CanAcceptMenu_28230=I am afraid that the fight between two associations would cause some damages.
CanAcceptMenu_28231=Then who won after so many years?
CanAcceptMenu_28232=Currently the matter of Beggar's Sect is not over. I am afraid some schemer will take advantages of this...
CanAcceptMenu_28233=Ok, I thought too much, then I have nothing to worry about in Wudang.
CanAcceptMenu_28234=I have nothing to do with Wudang. Xiang, what do you call me for?
CanAcceptMenu_28235=You should thank Xiang.
CanAcceptMenu_28236=I am leaving Wudang to investigate the whereabouts of the Tai Chi Sword.
CanAcceptMenu_28237=Incense Leader Huo, you're welcome. What are you going to do?
CanAcceptMenu_28241=Hi Brother...do you know where it is?
CanAcceptMenu_28242=Please don't hesitate to give me any advice.
CanAcceptMenu_28245=You can all go to hell.
CanAcceptMenu_28246=I don't care either lions or tigers. Take your best shot.
CanAcceptMenu_28253=In that case, no more speaking. Come on.
CanAcceptMenu_28254=A yellow-fur beast has died. Not a big deal.
CanAcceptMenu_28255=Why should I lie to you? I am also a caring person. It will wake up in one hour.
CanAcceptMenu_28256=Which hero will guard the next round? Is there any one with better skills?
CanAcceptMenu_28258=Then please instruct me, brother.
CanAcceptMenu_28259=You're welcome. Please feel free to give me advice.
CanAcceptMenu_28260=Thanks for your compliment. You have overrated me. It's due to good luck.
CanAcceptMenu_28265=It is just for luck. Please give me some advice, Brother!
CanAcceptMenu_28266=Then what should I do next?
CanAcceptMenu_28268=What? What you have found, Elder Brother?
CanAcceptMenu_28270=I helped you get rid of those peddlers. Would you please give me the token?
CanAcceptMenu_28271=Can you give me the token now?
CanAcceptMenu_28272=I'm flattered. I have some important business to handle. Please feel free to give me advice.
CanAcceptMenu_28273=All right. Please tell me.
CanAcceptMenu_28274=You're welcome. What are we going to do next?
CanAcceptMenu_28275=Now, I pass the round, right?
CanAcceptMenu_28277=Finally I passed the five rounds. Are the five Villa Leaders in the Villa?
CanAcceptMenu_28278=I passed by your Villa for investigating the whereabouts of Wudang Tai Chi Sword, so please kindly forget it if I offended you.
CanAcceptMenu_28279=I just came to your villa for the first time. What can I do for you?
CanAcceptMenu_28280=Villa Leader, is there any other thing that I can do for you?
CanAcceptMenu_28281=Second Villa Leader, what else can I do for you?
CanAcceptMenu_28282=The villa leader said we should not engage in conflict with the Beggar's Sect.
CanAcceptMenu_28284=Incense Leader Huo must have returned to the Beggar's Sect.
CanAcceptMenu_28287=Went away? Were they not here just now? Where did they go? Why didn't you stop them?
CanAcceptMenu_28288=You are welcome. It's a pity they were not caught.
CanAcceptMenu_28291=Elder Brother Huo, do you find anything wrong?
CanAcceptMenu_28292=Do you have any plans for the future, elder brother Huo ?
CanAcceptMenu_28293=Elder Brother Huo, do you have any idea? Please feel free to give me some advice.
CanAcceptMenu_28294=Find nothing, but...
CanAcceptMenu_28295=It's like this. During our investigation, Big Brother Huo and I found that the Six Pockets Elder seemed to have hidden something.
CanAcceptMenu_28296=You killed Vice Sect Leader or not? Say it.
CanAcceptMenu_28297=You can never tell one's true nature from their appearance.
CanAcceptMenu_28301=I was entrusted by Leader Xiao to investigate the matters of Beggar's Sect Vice Sect Leader and Wudang Tai Chi Sword. Have you found something, Brother?
CanAcceptMenu_28302=I'll try my best. Please trust me. But...
CanAcceptMenu_28303=I need to talk to Sheriff Long.
CanAcceptMenu_28304=You're welcome. Can you now tell me about Tai Chi Sword?
CanAcceptMenu_28305=Entrusted by Leader Xiao, I am investigating the death of Beggar's Sect Vice Leader and the whereabouts of Tai Chi Sword.
CanAcceptMenu_28306=You are welcome, Brother. Please tell me the news about Tai Chi Sword.
CanAcceptMenu_28307=I came here for the death of Yan Yuchen of Yanmen.
CanAcceptMenu_28308=Hello Elder, you have been here for a long time. Are you waiting for me?
CanAcceptMenu_28309=Thank you for your compliment, elder. Can you tell me now?
CanAcceptMenu_28313=Hey, Elder Brother, do you know the way to Xingxiu Sea?
CanAcceptMenu_28314=I'm really flattered. It's not worth mentioning.
CanAcceptMenu_28315=Is this Elder Brother Hang from Wudang? How are you doing? .
CanAcceptMenu_28316=Then you must know what happened to Wudang Tai Chi Sword.
CanAcceptMenu_28317=Where is Tai Chi Sword?
CanAcceptMenu_28318=Be careful, Elder Brother Hang. Don't breathe a word of this.
CanAcceptMenu_28319=You are welcome, Predecessor. If you don't want anything, I will take leave.
CanAcceptMenu_28320=It's like this. Your Shifu asked me to find you and tell you to go back. The world outside is too dangerous. You'd better go back.
CanAcceptMenu_28326=Is your Hall Master in Luoyang?
CanAcceptMenu_28327=It is well known that Beggar's Sect is always well-informed. You deserve the reputation as I witnessed today!
CanAcceptMenu_28328=Ah, you are the very Elder outside Yanmen Family. Thank you so much for your guidance.
CanAcceptMenu_28329=Do you have any other commands, Predecessor?
CanAcceptMenu_28330=Besides, there is a lot of dog meat. You can have all the left as long as you prepare some for the elder. I'll pay for it all the same.
CanAcceptMenu_28331=It smells good! Can I eat the Jiaohua Chicken now?
CanAcceptMenu_28332=Thank you very much for your lots of help, Predecessor.
CanAcceptMenu_28333=This thug also wants to kill me? Ridiculous.
CanAcceptMenu_28334=Whether Big Brother Piao found something new or not? Spit it out.
CompleteMenu_28193=Those Beggar's Sect disciples beneath the mountain want to see you.
CompleteMenu_28194=What do you call me for?
CompleteMenu_28195=I have driven away those Beggar's Sect disciples but also offended the whole sect. Wudang is safe for now.
CompleteMenu_28196=Taois Tian Jizit, I do not know...
CompleteMenu_28197=I've helped you defeat the Qi Clan disciple, but he said he would tell the Shifu to teach me more.
CompleteMenu_28198=Taoist, do you have any advice on how to find Tai Chi Sword? I will appreciate it very much if you offer me any.
CompleteMenu_28199=Now I've found out that Wudang Tai Chi Sword had been missing for years and I'm not engaged in the issue of your Vice Sect Leader.
CompleteMenu_28200=I am looking for the Wudang Tai Chi Sword which has been missing for years. Your vice sect leader was killed by some schemer. Here is a letter explaining everything.
CompleteMenu_28201=It shows that it is just a misunderstanding between Wudang and Beggar's Sect.
CompleteMenu_28202=Complete Task
CompleteMenu_28205=The leader of Wudang School said Wudang and Beggar's Sect are sharing information about the Tai Chi Sword.
CompleteMenu_28206=This is the power of Poshan Three Movements. Go away as quickly as you can.
CompleteMenu_28207=Now they are still beneath the mountain. If Incense Leader does not handle this matter properly, I am afraid Wudang will be dissatisfied.
CompleteMenu_28208=The headmaster told me he didn't take it to heart and asked me to see you off.
CompleteMenu_28209=I went down the mountain just now, and the Beggar's Sect disciple has not left. I have fought with him several times, but I found that his martial art set does not origin from Beggar's Sect...
CompleteMenu_28210=Incense Leader Huo is wondering who ordered you to come to Wudang?
CompleteMenu_28211=Incense Leader Huo, that guy is indeed suspicious. When I asked him where he came from, he immediately ran away. It's a pity that I failed to catch him.
CompleteMenu_28212=Immortal Ziyang, I have identified that the Beggar's Sect disciples beneath the mountain were disguised by schemer, who wanted to instigate the fight between Wudang and Beggar's Sect.
CompleteMenu_28213=I think the fight between two Associations of Chi Clan and Sword Clan is not necessarily a bad thing.
CompleteMenu_28214=I have already told Immortal Ziyang about what happened down the mountain. He will be grateful if you take the time to investigate it.
CompleteMenu_28217=Elder Lu, Elder Lu, what's wrong with you?
CompleteMenu_28218=Elder, I have found the token.
CompleteMenu_28219=Since we didn't fall into their treacherous plot, I guess the enemies won't give up.
CompleteMenu_28220=These are sweet-scented osmanthus that you want, and what is Hundred Flavor Wine?
CompleteMenu_28221=I have notified Taoist Jiuhe. He said he would come soon.
CompleteMenu_28222=Is it Pithy Formula of Heaven Dust Sword or Wudang Songxi Sword? Thanks a million.
CompleteMenu_28223=I came here this time to request Taoist Tian Jizi to give me some instructions.
CompleteMenu_28229=Taoist Tian Jizi asked me to bring a Letter of Challenge to you, saying that he is to play a decisive match with Chi Clan.
CompleteMenu_28230=However, it is inevitable that people will get seriously injured by accident in the fight of two associations. I am afraid that will cause hatred of the other party.
CompleteMenu_28231=Taoist Jiuhe is respected by everyone. You can definitely reconcile the two clans through the martial arts competition.
CompleteMenu_28232=The disguised Beggar's Sect disciple hasn't been caught. I'm worried he might make use of this martial arts competition.
CompleteMenu_28233=Immortal Ziyang said Xiang came to see me, is it true?
CompleteMenu_28234=I've killed the villain for you.
CompleteMenu_28235=I have helped Li Laoer get rid of the villains.
CompleteMenu_28236=The matter of Wudang has been settled. I should continue to find the whereabouts of Tai Chi Sword so as to clear myself of grievances.
CompleteMenu_28237=Hi Brother...
CompleteMenu_28241=Why is this place so dangerous?
CompleteMenu_28242=Hi Brother...
CompleteMenu_28244=Do you want to defeat me with this strength?
CompleteMenu_28245=I have warned the ruffian. Please tell me what I should do in the next round.
CompleteMenu_28246=You must be the Gatekeeping disciple of the second pass.
CompleteMenu_28253=The beast died easily after being hit only with a few fists.
CompleteMenu_28254=Your golden lion was only knocked out by me and will be fine.
CompleteMenu_28255=I have got the Lion head token. Please tell me where the next round is.
CompleteMenu_28258=Ok. I have applied the herbal medicine. You will be fine.
CompleteMenu_28259=You're defeated. Give me the token.
CompleteMenu_28260=Are you the Guard of the Fourth Level?
CompleteMenu_28265=I have not found the giant bear, and villagers nearby are very afraid of here.
CompleteMenu_28266=This is the giant bear you are looking for if I'm not mistaken...
CompleteMenu_28267=Hey, Elder Brother, have you hunted a giant bear in the back mountain?
CompleteMenu_28268=I learnt from back mountain hunters that this is possibly done by a group of greedy pelt vendors.
CompleteMenu_28269=I have cleaned those pelt vendors.
CompleteMenu_28270=I have told Scar Xiong and he asked you to rest assured. He ensured that there would be no one else in the mountain.
CompleteMenu_28271=I have passed four levels but how can I go through the last one?
CompleteMenu_28273=I've taken care of those poachers.
CompleteMenu_28274=I told Brother Yang, but he still feels guilty.
CompleteMenu_28275=I have passed the five rounds. Are there any other requirements?
CompleteMenu_28277=The five villa leaders master superior skills.
CompleteMenu_28280=Second Villa Leader, this is the liger flesh you asked for.
CompleteMenu_28281=The Fourth Villa Leader let me ask you what happened.
CompleteMenu_28283=If I hadn't buried the hatchet with Beggar's Sect just now, I would have given way to starting a fight.
CompleteMenu_28284=One day goes like many years without you. I miss you so much, Elder Brother Huo!
CompleteMenu_28285=Elder Jiao, I have regretted very much for offending you. Please forgive me.
CompleteMenu_28286=Where are the Beggar's Sect disciples beneath the mountain?
CompleteMenu_28288=Elder Jiao, listen to me...
CompleteMenu_28290=Elder Brother Huo, Sect Leader Xiao asked me to enquire you about the investigation of Beggar's Sect.
CompleteMenu_28291=Elder Jiao asked us to investigate it secretly and not to hit the grass and frighten the Snake.
CompleteMenu_28292=Leader Xiao asked us to fully investigate this so as to catch the true murderer of the Vice Leader.
CompleteMenu_28293=Incense Leader Huo, I have spread the news.
CompleteMenu_28294=Leader Xiao, after Elder Brother Huo and I investigated, we found something, but I do not know whether it is proper to say it.
CompleteMenu_28295=You are the hidden traitor as I thought. What else do you have to say?
CompleteMenu_28296=Sect Leader, Six pockets Elder intended to escape. I have caught and brought him here.
CompleteMenu_28297=Are you a Beggar's Sect disciple, Brother?
CompleteMenu_28301=I have taught disciples of Qing Sect for you.
CompleteMenu_28302=You are handsome and have good manners, Elder Brother, so you must be the well known Sheriff Long in Luoyang!
CompleteMenu_28303=Sheriff Long said they would release him soon.
CompleteMenu_28304=Brother, you must be the Leader of Beggar's Sect Luoyang Branch..
CompleteMenu_28305=I have cleaned those robbers.
CompleteMenu_28306=May I ask Yanmen Villa Leader...
CompleteMenu_28307=Take us to see your villa leader.
CompleteMenu_28308=I have killed robbers.
CompleteMenu_28309=Hey, Elder Brother...
CompleteMenu_28316=Tell me where Tai Chi Sword is.
CompleteMenu_28317=This is the secret letter Immortal Xingxiu intended to send to the mysterious man.
CompleteMenu_28319=Hi little girl, you look very sweet and beautiful, so you must be a Younger Martial Sister of Kunlun Sect.
CompleteMenu_28320=Are you a Beggar's Sect disciple, Brother?
CompleteMenu_28325=You should want to kill me. You should have taken a good look at yourself.
CompleteMenu_28326=Hall Master Piao, Xingxiu Sea...
CompleteMenu_28327=Hello Elder...
CompleteMenu_28328=I have cleaned those disguised sentries.
CompleteMenu_28329=I am afraid your inn will be closed if you offended the old man upstairs since he is of power.
CompleteMenu_28330=I have defeated those ruffians.
CompleteMenu_28331=I have cleaned the scum.
CompleteMenu_28332=I was told to ask if you have any news.
CompleteMenu_28333=Big Brother Piao, any news? What shall we do next?
CompleteMenu_28334=This is a letter from Younger Brother Xie. I will go to the Yanmen family to resolve the misunderstanding.
accept_28193_1=A band of Beggar's Sect disciples are gathered beside the mountain. Would you please see what they want?
accept_28194_1=<s>Please tell Xiang Jiuchen to come see me.
accept_28195_1=A mob of unruly beggars want to speak to the Headmaster? Hah! Drive them away!
accept_28196_1=<s>The Tai Chi Sword is Wudang's most precious secret treasure. Headmaster Taoist Chongxu knows more, if you're interested.
accept_28197_1=<s>I don't have time for your troubles. The Chi Clan has gravely insulted our Sword Clan. I'll help you take care of them.
accept_28198_1=<s>I only saw the Tai Chi Sword once.  Taoist Jiuhe can tell you what you need to know.
accept_28199_1=<s>Oh? It is about the relationship between Wudang and Beggar's Sect. How about you come with me to see Incense Leader Huo and I will help you clarify it?
accept_28200_1=<s>I haven't yet decided ona course of action. Please carry this secret letter to Elder Lu Mufang at the foot of Wudang Mountain.
accept_28201_1=<s>You may have been wronged,  but the relationship between the Beggar's Sect and Wudang is at stake here. Please ask Huo Rang to be patient.
accept_28202_1=<s>Thank you very much.
accept_28205_1=<s>Thank you for your help. Please tell Huo Rang that Wudang and the Beggar's Sect are at peace. We are deeply sorry for the loss of your ally, and hope you can help us further.
accept_28206_1=<s>Please tell the Wudang disciples to wait for me at the base of the mountain and not cause any trouble at the gate.
accept_28207_1=<s>You're just making excuses! Admit it!
accept_28208_1=My apologies for disturbing you. Please let the Headmaster know what has happened here.
accept_28209_1=<s>You again? This is between the Beggar's Sect and Wudang. Mind your business, outsider!
accept_28210_1=<s>Strange. I did not dispatch any Beggar's Sect Disciples to Wudang Mouontain. Perhaps Elder Lu did. Could you ask him?
accept_28211_1=<s>Ah, Incense Leader Huo, welcome!
accept_28212_1=<s>Somebody is trying to turn the Wudang and Beggar's Sect against one another. We should tell Elder Lu immediately!
accept_28213_1=<s>Is it true that you actually offended a Chi Clan disciple?
accept_28214_1=<s>Aha, punishment is not necessary. Chi Clan Taoist Yu Xuanzi is very kind. I think he will not embarrass you, and you should go to apologize to him.
accept_28217_1=<s>We need Elder Lu to reinforce the Beggar's Sect's defenses.
accept_28218_1=<s>Eh... why did I fall asleep? No, the scent made me recall that I was intoxicated by the enchanting incense.
accept_28219_1=I'll have to report this incident to the sect leader. Thank you for your help.
accept_28220_1=<s>I have notified the school disciples. You should go there and investigate.
accept_28221_1=<s>I am waiting for your sweet-scented osmanthus. Ha! Ha! You go and tell Taoist Jiuhe that he can taste the mellow wine of the world.
accept_28222_1=<s>Everyone likes these things, it's nothing special.
accept_28223_1=<s>Wudang Sword skills can not be taught to outsiders without the order of the headmaster. In any case, you appear to be too skilled already for this one move to give you any notable benefits.
accept_28229_1=<s>The Qi Clan always looks down on the Sword Clan disciples. So we'll have to fight and prove them wrong. Please send this challenge letter to Yu Xuanzi.
accept_28230_1=<s>Our clans have been at conflict since we established this sect. So you can tell Tian Jizi that I accept his challenge.
accept_28231_1=<s>That's why I meet the challenge. Both Tai Chi Sword and Tai Chi Fist couple hardness with softness. I just want to see which one is superior.
accept_28232_1=<s>We have the two Taoists here. So we'll be fine!
accept_28233_1=<s>Do you have any plans for the future?
accept_28234_1=<s>Li Laoer sent me a letter telling me that he is in grave danger. Somebody needs to go down the mountain and investigate.
accept_28235_1=<s>Xiang? Well then... Please thank him for me.
accept_28236_1=<s> We are relying on you to resolve the conflict between the Wudang and Beggar's Sect. Please be careful.
accept_28237_1=<s>I would love to become your older brother one day, for you are so chivalrous and kind-hearted.
accept_28241_1=<s>This place... this place is very dangerous. There are tigers and giant bears. I almost died here. But I lost my book box inside when I escaped just now.
accept_28243_1=<s>Visit? Who do you think you are to see our Villa Leader. You got to ask for my tiger's permission first.
accept_28244_1=<s>Ok, ok! Do not bluster. I will admit the defeat if you can pass our Five Rounds of Beasts.
accept_28245_1=<s>Well, do not be proud now. It is not that easy to pass the five rounds. What does that ruffian do? Drive him away and do not let him cause troubles here.
accept_28246_1=<s>Well, an uppity arrogant guy, I will make you cry soon later!
accept_28253_1=<s>I'll let you see what my Golden Lion is capable of.
accept_28254_1=<s>Ridiculous! You're going too far. Give me back my dear pet!
accept_28255_1=<s>Alright, I believe you. Though I had bet with my brother Xiaohu that you would not pass this round, so he has the token, now
accept_28256_1=<s>Well, it is guarded by martial brother Bao personally in the front and you will be frightened out of your wits!
accept_28257_1=<s>Have you see a man in black on the way here?
accept_28258_1=<s>Wait! This is the blood vivifying grease that I just made. Please help me apply it on Jin Qianbao.
accept_28259_1=<s>You saved my leopard that is my life. So if I fight you, then I will be ungrateful. Only that...
accept_28260_1=<s>It's only because you are not as skilled as others. This is the token. Take it.
accept_28265_1=<s>Wait. Can you first help me find one of the bears that the Shifu helped me tame? It appears to have gone missing.
accept_28266_1=<s>I remember Shifu put the giant bear in the back mountain. You go and look for it there.
accept_28267_1=<s>The giant bear is born cruel and hard to be tamed. My Shifu tried very hard to eliminate its animal character. Who would know...
accept_28268_1=<s>In the mountain are fierce tigers and wild beasts. Usually I just hunt some jackals and hare. I don't dare to go deep into the mountain, but...
accept_28269_1=<s>I'll give you the token if you go and kill that bastard.
accept_28270_1=<s>Wait! There's some villian called Scar Xiong at the back of the mountain. He's my brother. You go tell him to watch close. If he sees any poacher, just kill him.
accept_28271_1=<s>My beloved bear has died. I don't want to fight any more. You can take this token.
accept_28272_1=<s>I can hardly fight without my iron eagle.
accept_28274_1=Taming the beast is a very difficult skill. First, you have to weaken the beast's savage nature. There is Tianlong Grass growing in the mountain which can be mixed into food and weaken the beast's savage nature. You go and collect some.
accept_28275_1=<s>You have such excellent martial arts skills at such a young age, and are humble as well. Please take this token.
accept_28277_1=<s>All five villa leaders are in the villa as we speak. Please hurry and see them.
accept_28280_1=<s>You should see Laoer as soon as possible. It appears to be urgent.
accept_28281_1=<s>I'll need you to go ask the fourth brother about the recent occurrences along the mountain.
accept_28282_1=<s>of course I know the order of Villa Leader. What's more, we have get along well with Beggar's Sect in recent years. But I have no idea what's wrong with these skunk beggars. They have been very provocative.
accept_28284_1=<s>That's good. Now please go to the Beggar's Sect.
accept_28285_1=<s>Oh. Just now I went back to Beggar's Sect to report the Wudang incident to the sect leader. So I know nothing about it. You had better go and ask Elder Jiao.
accept_28287_1=<s>I don't know, either. Villa Leader told me not to make trouble, so I didn't stop them.
accept_28289_1=<s>Who on earth has made us Beggar's Sect unrighteous again and again? This is very important. Hurry and report it to the sect leader.
accept_28290_1=<s>The Beggar's sect appreciates your help very much!
accept_28291_1=<s>I found some traces of a traitor hidden within the Beggar's Sect. You should ask Elder Jiao whether he suspects anything about this.
accept_28292_1=<s>If it has anything to do with the elders in our sect, I can't decide on my own. You can go to ask the sect leader.
accept_28293_1=<s>Please tell everyone that Sect Leader Xiao has found out who the traitor is. Then we'll just wait and see the traitor reveal himself.
accept_28294_1=<s>Only what? You need not hide anything from me.
accept_28295_1=<s>The Six Pockets elder knows a lot, but doesn't speak much. We'll need to have a clear understanding of the subject before seeing him.
accept_28296_1=<s>I have some information but I can only tell your sect leader.
accept_28297_1=<s>Please accept this gold leaf for helping me uncover the spy. We also found out that the Tai Chi Sword is in Luoyang.
accept_28301_1=<s>The Qing Sect keeps trying to attack us. We'll need you to go and deal with them.
accept_28302_1=<s>My only youngest martial brother in Luoyang was arrested by Yamen Runners. You go and rescue him for me.
accept_28303_1=<s>Oh. This incorrigible little brat must be punished severely. If you come here for him, then please go back.
accept_28304_1=<s>The hall master mentioned the Tai Chi Sword just the other day. You should ask him about it.
accept_28305_1=The bandits outside Luoyang City have injured our disciples. Help me wipe them out.
accept_28306_1=<s>I've only heard rumors about it.
accept_28307_1=<s>The villa leader does not wish to see anyone.
accept_28308_1=<s>Kill the thief in White Horse Temple and I'll let you in on some secrets about Yanmen.
accept_28309_1=<s>The Tai Chi Sword is near the Xingxiu Sea in the Ruined Valley.
accept_28314_1=<s>What do you come to Evil Men's Valley for? Are you interested in becoming a member of Evil Men's Valley?
accept_28315_1=<s>Oh, it's you. What brings you here?
accept_28316_1=Who are you? You have no right to ask!
accept_28317_1=<s>I don't know anything about the Tai Chi Sword. However, the headmaster asked me to send a secret letter to a mysterious man down the mountain.
accept_28318_1=<s>I still think you'd better leave this place in case Immortal Xingxiu finds you.
accept_28319_1=<s>Wait, please. My lone disciple has gone missing. Can you please try and find her for me?
accept_28320_1=<s>The Shifu knows that I went down the mountain without his permission? I'm finished! I should go...
accept_28325_1=<s>According to the hall master, Immortal Xingxiu has dispatched many people to come and kill you. You'll need to be very careful.
accept_28326_1=Wild boars are terrorizing people. Would you kill them for me?
accept_28327_1=Thanks for your compliment. I was told of this incident by a master. The Elder is waiting for you in Luoyang.
accept_28328_1=Ha! Ha! You're welcome. Do you know why I help you? But, you must do me a few favors first. Some disguised sentries have emerged outside of the city. You go and get rid of them.
accept_28329_1=<s>Dog meat is my favorite. Go outside of the city and get some dog meat. Then give the meat to the shopkeeper.
accept_28330_1=<s>Ok. What can us powerless civilians do?
accept_28331_1=<s>The Jiaohua Chiken of out Beggar's Sect is very famous in the world. Take and eat it when it is still hot.
accept_28332_1=<s>I just want to test you. You are so young with such impressive martial arts and patience. You are proven to be a disciple of my Elder Brother.
accept_28333_1=<s>Eder martial brother, you cannot underestimate this gang of guys. They are mean and brazen. You can never tell what kind of base means they are capable of.
accept_28334_1=<s>Go to the police and resolve their misunderstanding with Shaolin Temple.
complete_28193=I have no idea how the leader of the Beggar's Sect teaches his subordinates. I will handle it.
complete_28194=<s>Oh. You're here. I would like to know what happened at the foot of the mountain.
complete_28195=Don't worry. I'll explain it to the Beggar's Sect for you.
complete_28196=<s>It is driving me mad! What? Who are you?
complete_28197=<s>I dare him! Don't be afraid. Nobody can touch you as long as I, Tian Jizi, am here.
complete_28198=<s>I heard Beggar's Sect Incense Leader Huo Ranghad just come to Wudang. Beggar's Sect is the first sect of the world and a good source of information. You can go and ask Huo Rang.
complete_28199=<s>I have heard about some of our disciples are making troubles in front of Wudang's gate. It is all my fault as a leader. But what about the Deputy Leader?
complete_28200=<s>Oh? Go and get me the letter.
complete_28201=In that case, you two clans should regard harmony as the most important thing. I'll immediately take these disciples back.
complete_28202=<s>The two forms of Yin and Yang produce four phenomena which act on the eight trigrams (bagua)...
complete_28205=OK, I know.
complete_28206=<s>These movements are just for show.
complete_28207=The Beggar's Sect should have instructed this group of disciples better.
complete_28208=<s>Thank you, Immortal Ziyang.
complete_28209=<s>It's true. But since you said...
complete_28209209=It's true. But since you said...
complete_28210=<s>I...I was...I was ordered by...by...
complete_28211=<s>It's quite meaningful.
complete_28212=<s>Thank you for defusing this grudge.
complete_28213=<s>You're right. But you shouldn't hurt Chi Clan disciples as you're not our disciple.
complete_28214=Thank you very much. I will find the truth.
complete_28217=<s>......
complete_28218=<s>Thank you. Your wisdom helped us avoid a catastrophe.
complete_28219=<s>You are right.
complete_28220=<s>Hundred Flavor Wine is brewed with a hundred types of flowers, grasses and herbs. I got one chance to try it. I still cannot forget its taste.
complete_28221=<s>Come later so we can enjoy it together.
complete_28222=<s>You think too much. Moves of martial arts are rigid. Every move can be broken. There is no weakness only in the state of our mind. Martial arts without moves may defeat those with moves, which is the highest level in practicing martial arts.
complete_28223=<s>The rules state that our martial arts can not be taught to people outside the school, but...
complete_28229=<s>Ok, I thought it was a great matter. Just forget this.
complete_28230=<s>Injury cannot be helped in a fight since fists have no eyes.
complete_28231=<s>The fight between the two Wudang Associations of Chi Clan and Sword Clan has a long history. I cannot do anything about it.
complete_28232=<s>Don't worry.
complete_28233=<s>Are you leaving Wudang?
complete_28234=<s>Thank you for your help.
complete_28235=Li Laoer will not be able to cope with the loss of his daughter. I'll send someone to bring him here to the mountain.
complete_28236=Thank the incense leader. I am going to leave Wudang now.
complete_28237=Through reading, we will gain what we want. But what should we do if there is no book?
complete_28241=<s>You don't even know this place?
complete_28242=<s>What? Who are you?
complete_28243=<s>You! You! You!
complete_28244=<s>Huh. I didn't think you had any skills.
complete_28245=<s>Well, the next round will be guarded by the disciple of our fourth Villa Leader Shi Yushi.
complete_28246=<s>You're right, I am the first disciple of Manor Lord Shi Yushi.
complete_28253=<s>Ah, Xiao Jin, you...
complete_28254=<s>Do you mean it?
complete_28255=<s>Don't be happy for now. You'll cry in the next pass.
complete_28256=<s>You're right. It's me.
complete_28257=<s>You have the hemostasis herbs? Thank you.
complete_28258=<s>Thank you! There must be some way I can repay your kindness.
complete_28259=<s>You are so skilled for one so young.
complete_28260=<s>You are foolish to have broken into the pass.
complete_28266=<s>Let me see. Right. This...This...indeed is...
complete_28267=<s>Stop joking.
complete_28268=<s>Ridiculous!
complete_28269=<s>Ok, it is still insufficient to release the hatred in my heart.
complete_28270=<s>Good brother, so straightforward!
complete_28271=<s>Well done. You have passed four passes.
complete_28273=<s>Good, you do have the ability to survive four passes.
complete_28274=It takes a lot to tame the beasts.
complete_28275=<s>You have passed five passes, go see five villa leaders with the five tokens.
complete_28277=<s>You're welcome.
complete_28278=<s>Don't flatter me.
complete_28279=I hereby owe you my sincere gratitude.
complete_28280=<s>Thank you.
complete_28281=<s>Such smelly beggars!
complete_28282=<s>What? Who are you?
complete_28283=<s>Oh? Is it true? Why does Beggar's Sect bear a grudge against us?
complete_28284=<s>I also miss you very much. I haven't seen you for a few days. How are you going?
complete_28285=<s>It is a great virtue of young people to correct what they have done wrongly. I have forgotten it.
complete_28286=<s>They left after you left the manor.
complete_28287=<s>I see. Thank you.
complete_28288=What happened?
complete_28289=<s>Oh? Is it true?
complete_28290=<s>You finally come. I have begun the investigation.
complete_28291=<s>Now that he can sense that I'm investigating the case and cut off the clue, he must have a prestigious position in the sect.
complete_28292=<s>If so, it's good. I happen to have an idea.
complete_28293=<s>Great, any discoveries?
complete_28294=<s>You're welcome. I asked you because I trust you. Feel free to say whatever is on your mind.
complete_28295=<s>Well, I want to see the Leader!
complete_28296=<s>Thank you. I can't believe the Six Pockets elder was a spy, he treated our Beggar's Sect so well. He must have been set up.
complete_28297=<s>You're right. It's me. What do you call me for?
complete_28301=<s>Has he already met the Leader? The vice leader was wronged and driven to death, so we hope he can help us find the true murderer.
complete_28302=<s>Well, why come to see me?
complete_28303=<s>Thank you. Incense Leader Huo was right about you.
complete_28304=<s>It's me. What do you call me for?
complete_28305=<s>Thank you. You're really chivalrous.
complete_28306=<s>Villa Leader gave the order that he would see nobody. Go away.
complete_28307=<s>Villa Leader gave the order that he would see nobody. Whatever you say will be useless.
complete_28308=<s>Good, I didn't pick the wrong person.
complete_28309=<s>Just like this valley, you'll never have life again.
complete_28313=<s>It's great to see good kung fu at such a young age.
complete_28316=Please spare me.
complete_28317=<s>I'm going to bring this letter to Immortal Ziyang.
complete_28318=<s>We will get rid of Immortal Xingxiu sooner or later.
complete_28319=<s>You're quite glib. What do you want?
complete_28320=<s>Are you the hero that our hall master referred to?
complete_28326=I admire you for getting through such an extremely dangerous journey safe and sound.
complete_28327=<s>Well. You're here. Come on. Take a seat. I have ordered wine and dishes. You can eat with me.
complete_28328=<s>Not bad!
complete_28329=It's busy in the inn, so I can't help you at this moment.
complete_28330=<s>Thank you. Luoyang people will suffer less now.
complete_28331=<s>Ok, nice, please sit down.
complete_28333=<s>I was about to send for you.
complete_28334=<s>Ok, just be careful!
context_28193=Beggar's Sect disciples are making noise at the foot of the mountain. Can you check it out for me?
context_28194=<s>You need not do anything about the incident that happened down the mountain. Just summon Xiang Jiuchen to meet me.
context_28195=<s>Such a bunch of smelly beggars, what do you think about Wudang School? Not every one can see the Headmaster. You go there and drive those smelly beggars away. Do not let them break the quietness of Wudang.
context_28196=<s>You can ask Taoist Chongxu about the treasured Tai Chi Sword.
context_28197=<s>The Qi Clan disciples are claiming we are weak. Can you punish them? If you win, I'll help you.
context_28198=<s>The Tai Chi Sword is Wudang's most precious treasure. I only saw it once. Why don't you go ask Taoist Jiuhe who knows everything. Maybe he has some information.
context_28199=<s>Oh? It's a favor Wudang owes you. How about you come with me to see Incense Leader Huo and I will help you clarify it?
context_28200=<s>Elder Lu is at the foot of Wudang Mountain. Please ask him to decide what to do.
context_28201=<s>Please ask Huo Rang not to act rashly and to wait for the decision of the leader.
context_28202=Thank you so very much.
context_28205=<s>Inform Huo Rang that the matter of the Tai Chi Sword requires much care from Beggar's Sect.
context_28206=<s>Please go down the mountain and send the message to the gate. Tell the Wudang disciples to wait for me at the mountain foot and not make trouble at the gate.
context_28207=<s>Don't make excuses!
context_28208=Could you please report it to the headmaster?
context_28209=<s>How come it's you again. This is the business between us Beggar's Sect and Wudang. Get out of here, you outsider. Don't stand in my way.
context_28210=<s>It is nothing at all, but I just remember that I did not dispatch any Beggar's Sect disciple to Wudang Mountain, and maybe they are dispatched by Elder Lu. You go to ask Elder Lu about this first.
context_28211=<s>Ah, Incense Leader Huo, welcome!
context_28212=<s>Tell Elder Lu about the dispute between Wudang and Beggar's Sect immediately and let him make a decision.
context_28213=<s>I heard that you offended a Qi Clan disciple a couple of days ago. Is this true?
context_28214=<s>Aha, punishment is not necessary. Chi Clan Taoist Yu Xuanzi is very kind. I think he will not embarrass you, and you should go to apologize to him.
context_28217=<s>We need Elder Lu to reinforce the Beggar's Sect's defenses.
context_28218=<s>Eh... why did I fall asleep? No, the scent made me recall that I was intoxicated by the enchanting incense.
context_28219=I'll have to report this incident to the sect leader. Thank you for your help.
context_28220=<s>I have notified the school disciples. You should go there and investigate.
context_28221=<s>I am waiting for your sweet-scented osmanthus. Ha! Ha! You go and tell Taoist Jiuhe that he can taste the mellow wine of the world.
context_28222=<s>It is nothing at all.
context_28223=<s>Wudang Sword skills can not be taught to outsiders without the order of the headmaster. In any case, you appear to be too skilled already for this one move to give you any notable benefits.
context_28229=<s>The Qi Clan always looks down on the Sword Clan disciples. So we'll have to fight and prove them wrong. Please send this challenge letter to Yu Xuanzi.
context_28230=<s>Our clans have been at conflict since we established this sect. So you can tell Tian Jizi that I accept his challenge.
context_28231=<s>That's why I meet the challenge. Both Tai Chi Sword and Tai Chi Fist couple hardness with softness. I just want to see which one is superior.
context_28232=<s>We have the two Taoists here. So we'll be fine!
context_28233=<s>The conflict between Chi Clan and Sword Clan cannot be helped. The Beggar's Sect incident is also clear. I have no reason to stay in Wudang any more. I'm going down the mountain to keep on looking for Tai Chi Sword.
context_28234=<s>Li Laoer sent me a letter telling me that he is in grave danger. Somebody needs to go down the mountain and investigate.
context_28235=<s>Xiang? Well then... Please thank him for me.
context_28236=<s> We are relying on you to resolve the conflict between the Wudang and Beggar's Sect. Please be careful.
context_28237=<s>I would love to become your older brother one day, for you are so chivalrous and kind-hearted.
context_28241=<s>This place... this place is very dangerous. There are tigers and giant bears. I almost died here. But I lost my book box inside when I escaped just now.
context_28243=<s>Visit? Who do you think you are to see our Villa Leader. You got to ask for my tiger's permission first.
context_28244=<s>Ok, ok! Do not bluster. I will admit the defeat if you can pass our Five Rounds of Beasts.
context_28245=<s>Well, do not be proud now. It is not that easy to pass the five rounds. What does that ruffian do? Drive him away and do not let him cause troubles here.
context_28246=<s>Well, an uppity arrogant guy, I will make you cry soon later!
context_28253=<s>I'll let you see what my Golden Lion is capable of.
context_28254=<s>Ridiculous! You're going too far. Give me back my dear pet!
context_28255=<s>Alright, I believe you. Though I had bet with my brother Xiaohu that you would not pass this round, so he has the token, now
context_28256=<s>Well, it is guarded by martial brother Bao personally in the front and you will be frightened out of your wits!
context_28257=<s>Have you see a man in black on the way here?
context_28258=<s>Wait! This is the blood vivifying grease that I just made. Please help me apply it on Jin Qianbao.
context_28259=<s>You saved my leopard that is my life. So if I fight you, then I will be ungrateful. Only that...
context_28260=<s>It's only because you are not as skilled as others. This is the token. Take it.
context_28265=<s>Wait. Can you first help me find one of the bears that the Shifu helped me tame? It appears to have gone missing.
context_28266=<s>I remember Shifu put the giant bear in the back mountain. You go and look for it there.
context_28267=<s>The giant bear is born cruel and hard to be tamed. My Shifu tried very hard to eliminate its animal character. Who would know...
context_28268=<s>In the mountain are fierce tigers and wild beasts. Usually I just hunt some jackals and hare. I don't dare to go deep into the mountain, but...
context_28269=<s>I'll give you the token if you go and kill that bastard.
context_28270=<s>Wait! There's some villian called Scar Xiong at the back of the mountain. He's my brother. You go tell him to watch close. If he sees any poacher, just kill him.
context_28271=<s>My beloved bear has died. I don't want to fight any more. You can take this token.
context_28272=<s>I can hardly fight without my iron eagle.
context_28274=<s>Taming the beast is a very difficult skill. First, you have to weaken the beast's savage nature. There is Tianlong Grass growing in the mountain which can be mixed into food and weaken the beast's savage nature. You go and collect some.
context_28275=<s>You have such excellent martial arts skills at such a young age, and are humble as well. Please take this token.
context_28277=<s>All five villa leaders are in the villa as we speak. Please hurry and see them.
context_28280=<s>You should see Laoer as soon as possible. It appears to be urgent.
context_28281=<s>I'll need you to go ask the fourth brother about the recent occurrences along the mountain.
context_28282=<s>of course I know the order of Villa Leader. What's more, we have get along well with Beggar's Sect in recent years. But I have no idea what's wrong with these skunk beggars. They have been very provocative.
context_28284=<s>That's good. Now please go to the Beggar's Sect.
context_28287=<s>I don't know, either. Villa Leader told me not to make trouble, so I didn't stop them.
context_28288=<s>I have sent some disciples to investigate it.
context_28289=<s>Who on earth has made us Beggar's Sect unrighteous again and again? This is very important. Hurry and report it to the sect leader.
context_28290=<s>The Beggar's Sect appreciates your help very much!
context_28291=<s>I found some traces of a traitor hidden within the Beggar's Sect. You should ask Elder Jiao whether he suspects anything about this.
context_28292=<s>If it has anything to do with the elders in our sect, I can't decide on my own. You can go to ask the sect leader.
context_28293=<s>Please tell everyone that Sect Leader Xiao has found out who the traitor is. Then we'll just wait and see the traitor reveal himself.
context_28294=<s>Only what? You need not hide anything from me.
context_28295=<s>The Six Pockets elder knows a lot, but doesn't speak much. We'll need to have a clear understanding of the subject before seeing him.
context_28296=<s>I have some information but I can only tell your sect leader.
context_28297=<s>Please accept this gold leaf for helping me uncover the spy. We also found out that the Tai Chi Sword is in Luoyang.
context_28301=<s>The Qing Sect keeps trying to attack us. We'll need you to go and deal with them.
context_28302=<s>My only youngest martial brother in Luoyang was arrested by Yamen Runners. You go and rescue him for me.
context_28303=<s>Oh. This incorrigible little brat must be punished severely. If you come here for him, then please go back.
context_28304=<s>The hall master mentioned the Tai Chi Sword just the other day. You should ask him about it.
context_28305=<s>Our disciples were injured by gangsters outside Luoyang City. Could he help me get rid of them?
context_28306=<s>I've only heard rumors about it.
context_28307=<s>The villa leader does not wish to see anyone.
context_28308=<s>Kill the thief in White Horse Temple and I'll let you in on some secrets about Yanmen.
context_28309=<s>The Tai Chi Sword is near the Xingxiu Sea in the Ruined Valley.
context_28314=<s>What do you come to Evil Men's Valley for? Are you interested in becoming a member of Evil Men's Valley?
context_28315=<s>Oh, it's you. What brings you here?
context_28316=<s>Who are you? You have no right to ask!
context_28317=<s>I don't know anything about the Tai Chi Sword. However, the headmaster asked me to send a secret letter to a mysterious man down the mountain.
context_28318=<s>I still think you'd better leave this place in case Immortal Xingxiu finds you.

context_28327=Thanks for your compliment. I was told of this incident by a master. The Elder is waiting for you in Luoyang.
context_28328=<s>I can tell you, but you have to get rid of the disguised sentries outside the city.
context_28329=<s>Dog meat is my favorite. Go outside of the city and get some dog meat. Then give the meat to the shopkeeper.
context_28330=<s>Don't be to hasty! There is only one dish that I like. My lifetime hobby is eating. I heard the Beggar's Sect's Jiaohua Chicken is very famous. I did them a small favor. You go and ask them for a chicken.
context_28331=<s>The Jiaohua Chiken of out Beggar's Sect is very famous in the world. Take and eat it when it is still hot.
context_28332=<s>I just want to test you. You are so young with such impressive martial arts and patience. You are proven to be a disciple of my Elder Brother.
context_28333=<s>Eder martial brother, you cannot underestimate this gang of guys. They are mean and brazen. You can never tell what kind of base means they are capable of.
context_28334=<s>Go to the police and resolve their misunderstanding with Shaolin Temple.
menu_28193_1=Ok. I'll go and have a look.
menu_28194_1=Ok.
menu_28195_1=Ok.
menu_28196_1=Thank you, Xiang.
menu_28197_1=How unfortunate! All right.
menu_28198_1=Ok. Thank you for your advice, Taoist.

menu_28210_1=Ok. I'll go and find Elder Lu.
menu_28211_1=Stop running.
menu_28212_1=Yes.
menu_28213_1=This is true. I had to take Taoist Tian Jizi's order and have a fight in order to find out where Tai Chi Sword is. Please punish me, Immortal.
menu_28214_1=Ok.
menu_28217_1=OK.
menu_28218_1=Elder, check if you are injured. Anything lost?
menu_28219_1=Elder Lu, you're welcome. I'll go and tell Immortal Ziyang to make Wudang reinforce their defense so as to keep out the schemer.
menu_28220_1=Ok.
menu_28221_1=Ok.
menu_28222_1=I've always admired Xiang's sense of justice and chivalry but my own skills are only average, so please advise me.
menu_28223_1=You're right.
menu_28229_1=This...Ok.
menu_28230_1=Ok.
menu_28231_1=There's no remedy? I'll find Taoist Jiuhe.
menu_28232_1=I'll find Immortal Ziyang.
menu_28233_1=Since Chi Clan and Sword Clan can't prevent and I have known the Beggar's Sect issue, I have no reason to stay in Wudang any longer. I will go down the mountain to continue my search for the whereabouts of Tai Chi Sword.
menu_28234_1=Ok. I'll go and take a look.
