accept_5401_1=It smells so good!
accept_5401_2=It's not nice to say so. I am the Abstinence-Breaking Monk. I don't care about the rules in Buddhism. I happen to have a Shaolin Secret Script. Do you want to have a look?
accept_5401_3=
accept_5402_1=I'm starving. Go to the woodcutter Diao Damin and ask for some wine. His wine is fragrant. You can find him in the forest behind the mountain. Then hunt some boars and get some fresh boar meat. I will barbeque it.
accept_5403_1=Diamond Sutra: At this moment, Bodhi asks Buddha: "How should we name this book and how should we follow this book?"
accept_5403_2=This skill need blood from a child that is less than 3 years old, as well as blood from a virgin. Follow the 4 words below and cultivate for 49 days. Then you will achieve some success. If you work hard at cultivation, you will achieve huge success after 81 days. By that time, the skill will be very powerful.
accept_5404_1=Where did you get that book from?
accept_5404_2=Find the Sweeping Monk at the library. He is the monk who takes care of the Shaolin library. He has read many books and is very knowledgeable. But he has a weird personality and is easy to get upset. Thus, not many like to talk to him. You can go and ask him.
accept_5405_1=Why do you do those strange moves? Leave now. Don't interrupt my peace.
accept_5405_2=If you don't leave, then I won't be nice.
accept_5406_1=Where did you get this manuscript?
accept_5407_1=Tell me about the details.
accept_5407_2=He ripped one page off the manuscript? Let me take a look.
accept_5407_3=Look at the ripped page. What's the difference between this and the rest pages in the manuscript? Use your hand and feel for it.
accept_5408_1=My guess is right. Look. It says "Shaolin Back Mountain".
accept_5408_2=Head out now. Head down the mountain to the left of the library. Follow the Dharma Cave until you reach the Tower Forest. Look around for clues. Don't let other shaolin disciples see you.
accept_5409_1=You are here right on time. I have a Monkey God. It is naughty and is now missing. Catch some fresh fish from the lake and bring it to me to prepare. Then use it to feed the Monkey. It will follow you back.
accept_5410_1=The moves you mentioned are really strange. Some of them are evil and belong to Wanderers Valley. Only Wanderers Valley Elders can learn them. Some of them are defensive moves, and belong to Shaolin. Demon and Buddha cannot coexist. How can martial arts have them overlapped?
accept_5410_2=50 years ago, Wanderers Valley killed a lot of people. The righteous attacked Wanderers Valley together and planned to destroy them at once. I was in that battle and fought with Wanderers Valley people quite a bit. I will never forget how evil their martial arts are.
accept_5411_1=It's something important. Don't underestimate the evil from the Wanderers Valley. Find the Shaolin headmaster and tell him about my guess. It's good to prepare early.
accept_5412_1=What you say makes sense. But there is no evidence that there are betrayers inside Shaolin. You have to understand the impact once the news of betrayers spreads. I think there is only one clue left now. Bring Monk Qing Shi here. I will ask him some things about the manuscript.
complete_5401=I found it by accident. Do you want it? If yes, you have to do me a favor.
complete_5402=I'm drooling. It smells so good...
complete_5403=This book is about advanced Buddhism and martial arts in Shaolin. Normal people do not have the ability to steal the treasure book from the library. If this is stolen, then Shaolin will be in danger.
complete_5404=Don't bother me. I am thinking.
complete_5405=Shaolin headmaster sent you to me. Go ahead. What's the matter?
complete_5406=Have you found any information?
complete_5407=Give me those herbs first.
complete_5408=You woke up. You were found unconscious at the back mountain by a patrolling monk. I examined your injury and found it was not bad.
complete_5409=Good job. That's a great help. Oh right. Why are you looking for me?
complete_5410=Welcome back. Did you get any information from the monk?
complete_5411=Is it that the Lunatic is back?
complete_5412=Shaolin's patrolling monks are selected by the Head of Warrior Monk Hall. They are top experts in the Shaolin Temple.
context_5401=Abstinence-Breaking Monk Qing Shi has a manuscript about Shaolin's martial arts. You had a look at it and found something weird. You are willing to help Qing Shi to do some things, then Qing Shi will gift the manuscript to you.
context_5402=You can ask the woodcutter Diao Damin and buy some wine. Hunt some <a href="findnpc_new,school08,NpcClone005063" style="HLStype1">Boars</a> nearby, and get some fresh meat from the <a href="findnpc_new,school08,NpcClone005063" style="HLStype1">Boars</a>. Collect some <a href="findnpc_new,school08,GatherClone005004" style="HLStype1">Wood</a> too, so that I could barbeque the meat.
context_5403=You find that this manuscript not only has some important Shaolin martial arts, but also mysterious and evil martial art practices. Why both Shaolin martial arts and some evil martial arts appear in the same script? Quickly go up the mountain and talk to <a href="findnpc_new,school08,WorldNpc00212" style="HLStype1">Abbot Xuanhuai</a>.
context_5404=You talked to the Shaolin headmaster, and found the manuscript has many unknown secrets. It is likely to cause chaos in Shaolin. The headmaster sends you to the library to find the Sweeping Monk and ask him about it.
context_5405=The Shaolin headmaster sends you to the library to find the Sweeping Monk and see if he knows anything about the manuscript. But the Sweeping Monk has a weird personality. You plan to make him angry, duel with him and get his trust so that you can have a further talk with him.
context_5406=You won the duel against <a href="findnpc_new,school08,FunnpcClone005041" style="HLStype1">the Sweeping Monk</a>. He is supposed to tell something about the manuscript. But then he decides not to, and even rips off a page from it. Go back and find <a href="findnpc_new,school08,WorldNpc00212" style="HLStype1">Abbot Xuanhuai</a>.
context_5407=You came back from the Sweeping Monk and told everything to the Shaolin headmaster. The headmaster thinks the ripped page from the manuscript is different from normal paper. He asks you to collect a special herb from back mountain, grind it and apply it to the paper.
context_5408=It is exactly as Shaolin headmaster guessed. The paper from the manuscript is made of a special herb. Content appears on the paper after wet herb is applied. It leads to the Shaolin Back Mountain.
context_5409=<a href="findnpc_new,,BossClone005015" style="HLStype1">Nameless Monk</a> Tongjing's Monkey God is missing again. It is naughty and must have gotten lost on its way back from the lake. Tongjing asks you to catch some fresh fish from the lake and hand it to him to prepare. Then you can feed it to the Monkey, earn its trust, and take it back.
context_5410=Tell <a href="findnpc_new,school08,BossClone005015" style="HLStype1">Nameless Monk</a> about the martial art moves of the black suit man whom you saw at the Shaolin Back Mountain.
context_5411=The Shaolin headmaster does not believe that there are betrayers inside Shaolin. He thinks it has something to do with the Lunatic. He sends you to ask the good friend of the Lunatic and see if the Lunatic is back yet without notice.
menu_5401_1=How dare you lie inside Shaolin? Be careful that the people from Discipline Hall will beat you up.
menu_5401_2=Tell me where you got this manuscript?
menu_5401_3=
menu_5402_1=I will go now. But you have to promise me first, that you will not let anyone know about this manuscript.
menu_5403_1=Diamond Sutra is Buddhism's advanced book. How can it be kept this way?
menu_5403_2=What kind of martial art is it? It is so evil. I'd better hurry up the mountain and tell Abbot Xuanhuai about it.
menu_5404_1=I got it by trading some wine and meat with Monk Qing Shi. He said it was a pick up from the road side. I didn't ask more about it. Hurry back and report to the Shaolin headmaster.
menu_5404_2=I am going now.
menu_5405_1=Haha. Bald monk.
menu_5405_2=Okay. Let's see what you can do.
menu_5406_1=I got it by trading with Monk Qing Shi. Shaolin headmaster sent me to you in hope to get some enlightenment. Can you tell something by looking at it?
menu_5407_1=I won in the duel against the Sweeping Monk. He is supposed to tell me something about the manuscript. But then he decided not to, and even ripped out a page from it.
menu_5407_2=Sweeping Monk seems to know something. He frowns but is not willing to tell me. Regardless of how much I beg him, he just sweeps on but does not respond to me.
menu_5407_3=You have a good eye. You can even find those details.
menu_5408_1=Shaolin Back Mountain. Is it a hint that the other half of the manuscript or the secret of the manuscript is there?
menu_5408_2=Yes, abbot.
menu_5409_1=Yes, monk.
menu_5410_1=Are you sure this is Wanderers Valley's martial arts?
menu_5410_2=Wanderers Valley's martial arts and Shaolin's advanced martial arts. What does that mean?
menu_5411_1=I will do it immediately!
menu_5412_1=Yes, abbot.

submit_5404=I...
submit_5405=Just now I offended you. Please forgive me. Take a look at this please.

submit_5407=Yes, Abbot.
submit_5408=Last night I was ambushed by a group of men in black on the Shaolin Back Mountain. They took the manuscript away from me.
submit_5409=Headmaster sends me to find you. It's like this...
submit_5410=This issue is not anything small. Monk Tongjing concludes that there are betrayers in Shaolin. He says...
submit_5411=I heard the Lunatic didn't come back. I don't think Monk Tongjing's conclusion makes sense.
submit_5412=The back mountain is well guarded. Maybe there are betrayers inside. Otherwise, how can anyone pass the guards so easily? Please give a second thought, Headmaster.
