
CanAcceptMenu_34483=Please give my regard to Headmaster of Jingang Sect.
CanAcceptMenu_34484=Sorry, I can't accompany you. I must return to the Valley quickly.
CanAcceptMenu_34485=I'd better go to see Brother Pang.
CanAcceptMenu_34486=Miracle Doctor Xue, I'll leave first.
CanAcceptMenu_34487=Even Brother Pang was injured by Kunlun Disciples. The evidence is certain.
CanAcceptMenu_34488=Sir, what happened to the Mysterious Persons?
CanAcceptMenu_34489=Brother Cao, what poison it is?
CanAcceptMenu_34490=This is the Token of Five-immortal Sect.
CanAcceptMenu_34491=Senior, I'll go to find the Miracle Doctor in Northern Desert now.
CanAcceptMenu_34492=Please tell me where the other two Guiding Drugs are.
CanAcceptMenu_34493=You look agitated. What happened?
CanAcceptMenu_34494=Is the Antidote ready, Senior?
CanAcceptMenu_34495=I've brought the medicines. There are three kinds.
CanAcceptMenu_34496=What's up?
CanAcceptMenu_34497=Headmaster must have something to do. I'll go there now.
CanAcceptMenu_34498=What happened?
CanAcceptMenu_34499=What secret?
CanAcceptMenu_34500=What should I do next?
CanAcceptMenu_34501=I'll go now if nothing else.
CanAcceptMenu_34502=Thank you. I'll go to find her now.
CanAcceptMenu_34503=Madam, I'll leave first.
CanAcceptMenu_34504=Xiao Yue, I'll go to find the Beggar's Sect Leader first.
CanAcceptMenu_34505=Leader Xiao told me that something happened here. What's the situation?
CanAcceptMenu_34506=I'll go to He Yiliu's house now, and see if there's a ghost or not.
CanAcceptMenu_34507=What happened?
CanAcceptMenu_34508=I was not good at the skills, and let him get away.
CanAcceptMenu_34509=<s>Little Brother, how do you feel?
CanAcceptMenu_34510=Leader Xiao, do you have any idea?
CanAcceptMenu_34511=Anything else, Leader Xiao?
CanAcceptMenu_34513=What are these used for, Headmaster?
CanAcceptMenu_34514=Brother Yang, do you think the two things are related?
CanAcceptMenu_34515=I don't know what you're worrying about.
CanAcceptMenu_34516=How can there be ghost in the world? Is there any Pulverized Lime near here?
CanAcceptMenu_34517=Leader Xiao, what should I do next?
CompleteMenu_34483=Five-immortal Sect? They must have sent people to Evil Men's Valley. I must go back and have a look.
CompleteMenu_34484=What happened to Kunlun Sect? I'd better go to see Brother Pang first.
CompleteMenu_34485=Miracle Doctor Xue, Brother Pang is injured. I've collected some Qingky Grass. Please prepare it into medicine.
CompleteMenu_34486=Complete Task
CompleteMenu_34487=Why do people even lurk near the Kunlun Sect Master?
CompleteMenu_34488=No. It's hard to avoid misunderstanding.
CompleteMenu_34489=Senior, this is Token of Five-immortal Sect.
CompleteMenu_34490=You're welcome, Senior.
CompleteMenu_34491=Sorry to offend you, but I must save people.
CompleteMenu_34492=Thanks for your guidance, Senior.
CompleteMenu_34493=I've got the things done, and collected the Siberian Cocklebur Grass, Senior.
CompleteMenu_34494=I've collected all the Guiding Drugs needed for the Antidote, Senior.
CompleteMenu_34495=There're a few Scouts of Five-immortal Sect. Please patrol more.
CompleteMenu_34496=Be careful if you meet such a thing in the future.
CompleteMenu_34497=I can get even with Five-immortal Sect by the way.
CompleteMenu_34498=You're not going anywhere!
CompleteMenu_34499=I was naive and let him escape.
CompleteMenu_34500=I've got the things you want.
CompleteMenu_34501=Ok, I'll go right now.
CompleteMenu_34502=The thieves have sold the Ring. Sorry.
CompleteMenu_34503=These people must have come to inquire about Nine Yin Manual. Do you know where your Master is?
CompleteMenu_34504=What's up?
CompleteMenu_34505=Ok, I'm not afraid.
CompleteMenu_34506=This is the ghost? Yellow and squeak? Some people in Beggar's Sect are even afraid of a Weasel.
CompleteMenu_34507=I let the ghost get away.
CompleteMenu_34508=I heard that you were poisoned. How do you feel now?
CompleteMenu_34509=What shall I do?
CompleteMenu_34510=I've brought all the stuff.
CompleteMenu_34511=Which schools are good at using poison?
CompleteMenu_34512=Here are the scorpions and Yuanrong grass you needed.
CompleteMenu_34513=Brother Young, this must be Corpse Poison. It's the same as the situation in Beggar's Sect.
CompleteMenu_34514=As expected, the people of Twelve-Linked Fortress hide here and covet the treasure of Ancient Tomb. They also prepared the poison.
CompleteMenu_34515=Look, this is the Waist Token of Twelve-Linked Fortress.
CompleteMenu_34516=I've got the Pulverized Lime. Sprinkle it on the ground and roll it out.
CompleteMenu_34517=Brother Ye, please communicate the evildoing of Twelve-Linked Fortress to Alliance Leader Lin.
accept_34483_1=You're so chivalrous. Sorry to have troubled you.
accept_34484_1=<s>Well, go back quickly. I don't think it would be so simple.
accept_34485_1=<s>They wounded brother Pang even though there has been no resentment between Kunlun Sect and the Ruined Valley.
accept_34486_1=<s>Apply this to his wound quickly. Don't delay, otherwise his bones and muscles would be affected seriously.
accept_34487_1=I'm worried. Kunlun Sect is in turmoil, so I can't make trouble in Ruined Valley.
accept_34488_1=<s>Huh! How dare you ask me, you cunning man! Did you bring the Mysterious Persons into our school and take the opportunity to assassinate me?
accept_34489_1=<s>It's a long story. I'll tell you all about it.
accept_34490_1=<s>As expected, it is Five-immortal Sect. They haven't set foot in the Central Plains in recent years, but they made such a big move this time and even ran wild in our territory.
accept_34491_1=<s>Miracle Doctor Xue? Well, he can remove the poison certainly, but I'm not personally acquainted with him. Please invite him to help me.
accept_34492_1=Black Silk Bloody Snakes have appeared in Xingxiu Sea. The old fisherman knows where they are.
accept_34493_1=<s>Punish the people polluting the lake and get some Siberian cocklebur grass.
accept_34494_1=<s>Well, the Antidote is done. Take it now. Then go to Ice Silkworm Plains to collect Black Silk Bloody Snakes and Fire Melting Frozen Silkworms. There're many Guards in there. Be careful.
accept_34495_1=You've worked hard to collect Black Silk Bloody Snakes and Fire Melting Frozen Silkworms. What is the third kind?
accept_34496_1=<s>The master said the medicine is finished, so get it and cure Cao Yi'an.
accept_34497_1=<s>Hmm, thanks for your trouble. Go to see the Headmaster, and see if there's anything to do.
accept_34498_1=Sister Song is spreading poisonous worms outside the door, so our disciples dare not go there. Please help us.
accept_34499_1=<s>I know the secret of Nine Yin Manual! It's noisy here. Follow me.
accept_34500_1=Everyone says the Nine Yin Diagram has returned, and some claim to have seen it. Ask the waiter in Yanjing about it.
accept_34501_1=<s>Wait, what a bad memory! A girl called Xiao Yue came to find you a few days ago. I almost forget it.
accept_34502_1=<s>Hmm, the Jewelry Shop is over there. Turn the corner and you'll be there.
accept_34503_1=Well, she's near the Pond. Go now. Don't let her wait too long.
accept_34504_1=<s>I'll get useful information after I arrive in Beggar's Sect. Their informers spread all over the country. I hope I can check it out early.
accept_34505_1=<s>He Yiliu's house is haunted. Everyone's nervous.
accept_34506_1=<s>If you are able to check it out, I won't care about the things happened before.
accept_34507_1=<s>Help, the ghost is back.
accept_34508_1=You must be lying. You must have let go that bad guy. So you've planned it, and come to create difficulties here! Brothers, catch him.
accept_34509_1=<s>Now I seem to feel better. This poison is severe. Cough.
accept_34510_1=<s>Collect some wood and torches for me, as well as wet snake galls and hot dog's blood.
accept_34511_1=<s>I asked people to prepare these Pills. They can treat Corpse Poison. Please remove Yun Xing's poison with these Pills. I'll arrange people for other Disciples.
accept_34514_1=<s>This should be started with Ancient Tomb.
accept_34516_1=<s>There's a ghost. It's real. We all saw him. How can I cheat you? The Pulverized Lime is near the next house. You can find it easily.
accept_34517_1=Go to Suzhou, ask Ye Fei to tell Lin Tiannan, and ask about the Nine Yin Diagram.
complete_34483=<s>The technique looks familiar. It may be a member of Five-immortal Sect.
complete_34484=<s>Thanks to you, otherwise I would have been killed by them.
complete_34485=Wait a moment. I'll grind it now.
complete_34486=Really?
complete_34487=<s>What happened to the Mysterious Persons?
complete_34488=<s>I see. Sorry, please forgive me, sir.
complete_34489=<s>As expected, it is Token of Five-immortal Sect.
complete_34490=<s>Thank you.
complete_34491=<s>Anyway, you do it to save people. Ok, let me tell you where the other two things are.
complete_34492=<s>Well, you're welcome.
complete_34493=<s>Take the Antidote in advance after it is prepared.
complete_34494=<s>We're saved. We can't thank you enough.
complete_34495=Hmm, brothers, report every condition to me, understand?
complete_34496=<s>It's greed and curiosity that kill me.
complete_34497=<s>Sister Song is asking you to hand over the Nine Yin Diagram.
complete_34498=<s>Wait, I have a secret here.
complete_34499=<s>It's not your intention. Go back and have a rest now.
complete_34500=<s>Sorry to trouble you. I'm occupied now.
complete_34501=<s>She said she wanted to repair the hairpin. Check the jewelry shop.
complete_34502=<s>You're back. This is Xiao Yue's Hairpin. Bring it to her.
complete_34503=<s>Ask the Beggar's Sect.
complete_34504=<s>He Yiliu's house is haunted. Everyone's nervous.
complete_34505=<s>Do you dare to investigate it since you're confident about it?
complete_34506=<s>There's a ghost. It's true.
complete_34507=<s>Escaped? Why do you come back if he escaped?
complete_34508=<s>Ow, ow, it hurts.
complete_34509=<s>This is corpse poison, the most sinister toxin.
complete_34510=<s>With all these stuff, I must be able to destroy Corpse Poison Array.
complete_34511=<s>Not many schools know how to use poison besides Five-immortal Sect and Xingxiu Sea. Even less schools know how to use Corpse Poison.
complete_34512=What are you doing here?
complete_34513=<s>How dreadful...
complete_34516=<s>Hmm, I know.
complete_34517=Um. I know.
