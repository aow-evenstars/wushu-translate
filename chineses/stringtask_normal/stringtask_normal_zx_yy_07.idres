CompleteMenu_22494=Are you Dabie Idleman?
CompleteMenu_22495=Please help me.
CompleteMenu_22496=Is this Divine Deer Herb?

CompleteMenu_22501=Thank you…
CompleteMenu_22502=I came to seek enlightenment. With Dabie Idleman's recommendations.
CompleteMenu_22503=I am back.
CompleteMenu_22505=What happened?
CompleteMenu_22507=I heard you have an exquisite Jade Pendant. Maybe…
CompleteMenu_22510=I got your Jade Pendant back. It was taken by Lu Yu.
CompleteMenu_22512=What happened?
CompleteMenu_22513=What should we do?
CompleteMenu_22514=I found this on the Wild Monk.
CompleteMenu_22516=The Headmaster told me to come ask for your help regarding the antidote of Ice Silkworm Poison.
CompleteMenu_22517=I am on my way to find Fire Toxic.
CompleteMenu_22518=Have you heard about the Fire Toxic near here?
CompleteMenu_22520=You are the leader of those bandits, are you not?!
CompleteMenu_22522=But you never did any good either!
CompleteMenu_22523=I taught them a lesson.
CompleteMenu_22524=The bandits left.
CompleteMenu_22525=This is the Inner Pill of Fire Toxic. It can counter the Ice Silkworm Poison.
CompleteMenu_22528=I am planning to go to a Wulin Tournament held in Luoyang.
accept_22481_1=Silent Temple might be planning an invasion, so we are leaving Muyun Villa. You can go to Evil Men's Valley and find my friend Cao Yi'an. He will take care of you.
accept_22483_1=I heard the people of Muyun Villa asked you to come here.
accept_22484_1=Yi'an is in the mountain. Go find him.
accept_22485_1=Why did you come to Kunlun?
accept_22486_1=Anyways, you will uncover your past in due time, but the time is not now. This is for your own good. You have a bad memory but do you still remember your martial arts? Let's spar!
accept_22487_1=Either way, the Silent Temple is not to be trifled with. They must have a strong background. You should stay in Kunlun. Nothing to do anyway, so let us cook something. Smells great, right? Help me add some fire.
accept_22488_1=It is important to control the fire carefully when cooking, so everything goes just right. Only then will you taste perfection… Look, there is a rabbit. Quick, go catch it.
accept_22489_1=This is a bottle of my special seasoning. Spread some evenly here.
accept_22490_1=My master Yun Yangzi is collecting rare herbs to refine medicine. Go collect some Green Faery.
accept_22491_1=Take Green Faery to my master. Oh, there is one more thing.
accept_22492_1=Take Green Faery to my master. Then you can go find Dabie Idleman.
accept_22493_1=Take this Xun Riwan. It might help strengthen your Inner Skill.
accept_22494_1=Looks like you have unfinished business. Off you go.
accept_22495_1=What the…
accept_22496_1=Divine Deer Herb is near. Hope you can pass the obstacles and successfully retrieve it.
accept_22500_1=Drink this Herb Liquid. It is good for you.
accept_22501_1=Looks like you had your rest. Let's fight!
accept_22502_1=Do not gloat. My friend Tao Master Wu Wei always say he is more talented in the martial arts than me. Go spar with him. It will be good for you.
accept_22503_1=Show me your moves.
accept_22505_1=I have nothing more to teach you. It is time for you to leave.
accept_22507_1=I lost my family heirloom, the Jade Pendant. I suspect Ouyang Zi stole it but I have no proof. Can you help me?
accept_22510_1=I just defeated a couple of people the likes of you. You want some too?!
accept_22512_1=Wait, this is not my Jade Pendant… The Headmaster gathered the disciples and I was busy guarding the mountain. I will return this pendant to Lu Yu. Go to the Headmaster.
accept_22513_1=Something happened to one of the disciples…
accept_22514_1=So I need your help to find that Wild Monk and the antidote.
accept_22516_1=This might not be enough. My younger martial brother is skillful at healing and familiar with the strange things of the world. You should ask him about the antidote of Ice Silkworm Poison.
accept_22517_1=Everything in this world has its counterpart.
accept_22518_1=Go find the Fire Toxic and take back its Inner Pill. Be careful.
accept_22520_1=I am scared everytime I walk this way ever since it is rumored that the Fire Toxic has appeared, not of Fire Toxic, but of the bandits who appeared out of nowhere. They will block anyone's way and rob them of their belongings.
accept_22522_1=Mercy!
accept_22523_1=They are over there trying to lure out the Fire Toxic. If you take care of them I promise I will leave this place and start a new life with my brothers.
accept_22524_1=Much thanks. Me and my brothers are leaving.
accept_22525_1=It is rumored the Fire Toxic will appear when there is a big fire. Why don't you go over there and light this torch to lure it out.
accept_22528_1=I heard that Wulin Tournament is about to take place in Luoyang. A lot of people will be come. I went to one of those back in the day. So curious how many skilled fighters are there now. You should go check it out.
complete_22481=What have you come to Kunlun for?
complete_22483=You lost your memories? How inconstant the affairs of the world are. You need not worry too much, because forgetting pain and starting anew might be not a bad thing.
complete_22484=You are… It is you!
complete_22485=It might be better for you not to know. Else your impulses might harm you.
complete_22486=You are not as good as you used to be, but you still defeated me. Can you still use the Six Quick Stabs move of yours?
complete_22487=Mmm, smells so good.
complete_22488=Yes, it will be a nice meal.
complete_22489=Yes, I made this myself. I will teach you next time.
complete_22490=Yes, this is it.
complete_22491=Great.
complete_22492=Oh? Hahaha, okay.
complete_22493=That is because the medicine is working slowly.
complete_22494=What did you call me? You do not know who I am?
complete_22495=Okay then.
complete_22496=Yes, this is it. Not bad.
complete_22500=Do you not know that a good medicine is bitter? This will help you keep your focus.
complete_22501=You really are a talented martial artist, having got this far after losing your memories and starting over. For this you have my respect.
complete_22502=Did that old man find help just because he can't defeat me alone?
complete_22503=So? You look… So you defeated that old man, didn't you?
complete_22505=Oh, you are back.
complete_22507=What? Another one who wants to take my Jade Pendant!
complete_22510=Oh thanks.
complete_22512=I am glad you are back…
complete_22513=I heard that Wild Monk has an Ice Silkworm, so he must also have the antidote for Ice Silkworm Poison to cure my disciple.
complete_22514=This Ice Scale Grass should help ease up the Ice Silkworm Poison.
complete_22516=I know what happened and I have a plan.
complete_22517=But we do not know where this Fire Toxic is…
complete_22518=Fire Toxic? I know!
complete_22520=Yes, yes. Wait! No no!
complete_22522=But… But we were just following their orders!
complete_22523=Really? Thank you so much.
complete_22524=Thank you very much.
complete_22525=So it really does exist! Now there is hope.
complete_22528=You are leaving? Alright. Now you have completed your training and everyone in Wulin is united in Luoyang, it might be the right time for you to recover your memories.
