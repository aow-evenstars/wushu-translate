context_38001=Abbot Xuanhuai has asked you to familiarize yourself with the temple and your new brothers.
context_38003=Jingneng is behaving strangely... I think he knows something about the missing scripts. Another nearby Elder Brother may be able to help.
context_38004=Jingneng is a disciple of Zu Ming. Zutong has a disciple named Jing De. He and Jingneng have a close friendship. Find Zu Ming yourself and tell him about it.
context_38006=Zu Ming thinks the thief used the veil and scarf in the box to cover his face. But if Sutra Pavilion is well-guarded, how did the thief get in and steal the scripts?
context_38008=<s>Jing De was attacked by evil monks. I repelled them, but he was poisoned in the assualt.
context_38009=Jing De was poisoned and needs medical attention. Go and ask Master Xuan Cheng for help.
context_38010=Master Xuan Cheng can do nothing to stop the poison within Jing De. In his opinion, only the person who poisoned Jing De can save him.
context_38011=Master Xuan Cheng needs to make Jing De more revival pills. Go fetch water from the Lotus Pool beside the bridge of the Lixue Pavilion.
context_38012=The Abbot was just informed that some Foreign Monks were found nearby. Are they?from the group who attacked Jing De? Were they involved with the stolen scripts? I must find out more from Liao Yin Immortal.
context_38014=Liao Yin Immortal said that?they have caught a suspicious monk and handed him over to Qing Yuan, but the captive monk has refused to talk. He was one of people who attacked Jing De. When the Lama was asked for an antidote, he said there was no antidote for this kind of poison.
context_38018=The captive Lama is very stubborn, and he refuses to yield any more information. How can the riddle in the Secret Letter be deciphered?
context_38022=<s>The arrested Lama is stubborn. Search the left poison from his body. Serve him with the same sauce.
context_38025=<s>The poison was fed to the Lama and he said the antidote is kept in his shoe. Speak to Elder Brother Qingyuan.
context_38027=<s>The Western Lama has admitted he is not alone here. He has some fellows somewhere. The answer of the puzzle is the Qingfeng Pavilion at the east of the Bodhidharma Hall. Watch out the Lama who is the connecter there.
context_38028=Another suspicious monk is in the Clean Wind Pavilion, and may be waiting to meet with his accomplice. Subdue him and ask how the script was stolen.
context_38029=Jing De fell into a coma again. Master Xuan Cheng said that Jing De had died, and told Zu Ming and the abbot of the news.
context_38030=The evil monks who stole scripts have been arrested, and the abbot will decide their punishment. Go quickly to Jing De, who is awake but weak.
context_38032=Jingde went into a coma again. It is lucky that I always took along the Antidote from West Monk. Hard work pays off. Finally Jingde was saved.
context_38034=Was it fate or a man-made disaster for Jing De and Jingneng? Listen to Abbot Xuanhuai.
context_38036=Was it fate or a man-made disaster for Jing De and Jingneng? Listen to Abbot Xuanhuai.
