
CanAcceptMenu_22289=As long as the hope exists, I will never give up.
CanAcceptMenu_22290=It's the son of Elder Bai Ge who told me to come here and seek help from Elder Hong Qin.
CanAcceptMenu_22291=I'm sure that you will recover, elder.
CanAcceptMenu_22292=Hey
CanAcceptMenu_22293=I hope it works this time.
CanAcceptMenu_22294=I will give you another chance, will you amend?
CanAcceptMenu_22295=Okay, I believe that you will keep your promise. Goodbye.
CanAcceptMenu_22296=Did you take the medicine, Elder Hong Qin?
CanAcceptMenu_22301=If you want money, just say it, but you soldiers are really outrageous.
CanAcceptMenu_22302=I think so too. Let me do it.
CanAcceptMenu_22303=I won't leave unless you punish him here.
CanAcceptMenu_22304=If I find you committing crimes again, I will kill you.
CanAcceptMenu_22305=No matter how, you should give him a chance.
CanAcceptMenu_22306=You're right. How is Elder Hong Qin now?
CanAcceptMenu_22307=Can you still remember the past affairs?
CanAcceptMenu_22308=Thank you. I will go to find now.
CanAcceptMenu_22309=Who are those people?
CanAcceptMenu_22310=Be stolen? Who could do this?
CanAcceptMenu_22313=I come here for Elder Hong Qin...
CanAcceptMenu_22314=I need to prepare something first.
CanAcceptMenu_22315=I admire you very much and want to make friends with you.
CanAcceptMenu_22316=I admire you five very much and I'd like to visit the other four elders.
CanAcceptMenu_22317=Are you studying rare herbs? I know a little about them.
CanAcceptMenu_22318=I want to learn how to cook dog meat. Please teach me.
CanAcceptMenu_22319=That's what I should time. I'd like to learn from again when I'm free.
CanAcceptMenu_22320=I don't know if you...
CanAcceptMenu_22321=This can also be regarded as revenge for Chen Buyou.
CanAcceptMenu_22322=May I make friends with you.
CanAcceptMenu_22323=It's my pleasure to get your appreciation.
CanAcceptMenu_22325=I don't think so, so what should we do next?
CanAcceptMenu_22326=What a bad luck.
CanAcceptMenu_22327=How about to call other four elders and drink together?
CanAcceptMenu_22328=Now we have six, only a jar of wine seems to be not enough.
CanAcceptMenu_22329=Don't be afraid. I'm requested by Ma Banxian to defeat them...
CanAcceptMenu_22330=There is nothing we can do but to fight against them.
CanAcceptMenu_22331=Have you thought of how to treat the illness of Elder Hong Qin?
CanAcceptMenu_22332=I'm sure that you will recover, elder.
CompleteMenu_22289=Is Elder Hong Qin here?
CompleteMenu_22290=I hardly collected these.
CompleteMenu_22291=I see that the elder is still off color.
CompleteMenu_22292=Lady, is this medicine you required?
CompleteMenu_22293=You are so stubborn. I've given you a chance, but you refused.
CompleteMenu_22294=I defeated those soldiers. Here are the properties they robbed.
CompleteMenu_22295=The Mountain Bandit Leader sworn not to harass the common people.
CompleteMenu_22296=What can I do for you?
CompleteMenu_22301=I've beaten that blamed soldier away.
CompleteMenu_22302=You do know what your heelers are doing, right?
CompleteMenu_22303=You are really bastards. Don't shout, I'll kill you if you shout again.
CompleteMenu_22304=It's so funny that the soldier kept begging for mercy.
CompleteMenu_22305=How delightful it is!
CompleteMenu_22306=How are you, elder? Are you alright?
CompleteMenu_22307=Elder, do you have any clue?
CompleteMenu_22308=Are you alright? Who are those people?
CompleteMenu_22309=I found the package, but there is only a piece of paper inside it.
CompleteMenu_22310=Are you the doctor Ma Banxian?
CompleteMenu_22313=I have the confidence to approach them.
CompleteMenu_22314=Nice to meet you, elder.
CompleteMenu_22315=I accept your challenge!
CompleteMenu_22316=I'm a friend of Elder Wu Zhanyuan, and I come here to visit you.
CompleteMenu_22317=You're welcome, elder. This is only a small gift.
CompleteMenu_22318=I'm a friend of Elder Wu Zhanyuan and Zhu Tong. Please accept the dog meat.
CompleteMenu_22319=Elder Lu, these are the gifts for you. I'm...
CompleteMenu_22320=These are seized from those corrupt soldiers. Do you like them?
CompleteMenu_22321=Nice to meet you, Elder Feng. I'm...
CompleteMenu_22322=How did I answer?
CompleteMenu_22323=I've won the favorable impression of the Five Demons.
CompleteMenu_22325=What bad luck! One of my jar of wine seems to has been stolen!
CompleteMenu_22326=Elder, here is the wine.
CompleteMenu_22327=The other four elders will come soon.
CompleteMenu_22328=Brother, are you also captured by them?
CompleteMenu_22329=Elder, here are the villagers caught by them. I've got it done.
CompleteMenu_22330=It's really a hard fight.
CompleteMenu_22331=Ma Banxian said that you are suffering from heart disease. Please try this medicine first.
CompleteMenu_22332=Do you know where does Miracle Doctor Xue live at?
accept_22289_1=Please help me say hello to my aunt. I heard that my aunt was too sad and seriously ill because of my father's death.
accept_22290_1=<S>My master and Bai Ge were best friends. A few days ago, my master became depressed and grieved, and even got amnesia after learning the news of the death of Bai Ge. I'm afraid that she can't help you for the time being. But I'm going to pick some Seven Leaf Grass to help my master. I hope it will be useful.
accept_22291_1=Thank you! I hope that my master can recover, but only these herbs...
accept_22292_1=Medicinal materials are very rare recently due to the flood. The bandits took advantage of the opportunity to revolt and the soldiers also came to loot our common people. I hope I could find the medicinal materials I wanted in the mountains, but...
accept_22293_1=I think the best solution is to persuade their leader. The leader of the mountain bandits had received benefits from my master. I hope you can persuade him to be good.
accept_22294_1=Just now I saw some soldiers robbing the common people and they left. I'll obey you if you can let them mend their ways.
accept_22295_1=Okay, I'll keep my words. I swear not to bully the common people and I will return their properties.
accept_22296_1=The master is resting. I'll check on the situation later. Look, here comes a soldier. He must want to loot the belongings in the name of inspection.
accept_22301_1=How dare you say this to me. I must defeat you bastard.
accept_22302_1=He must tell this to his officer since you released him.
accept_22303_1=You're really trying my patience! We are still short of coolies, so if you didn't want to leave, then stay here.
accept_22304_1=I don't dare anymore. This is in fact an order from the higher position and I can't disobey it. But don't worry, I always keep my word and never break my promise.
accept_22305_1=You see, they followed you all the way here, so it looks like we'll have to work together to defeat them.
accept_22306_1=The medicine should be working now, but I don't know if it really works.
accept_22307_1=I can vaguely remember something, but when I think about it hard, my head hurts again...
accept_22308_1=Let me think...Ah, I've hidden the package under a big stone, it is at...
accept_22309_1=I'm not sure. I just know that if you mess with them, it won't come to a good end. Thank you this time. Now I'm going to see how the Village Head is doing.
accept_22310_1=Let me think again...Ah, my head hurts. Hurry, hurry to find Doctor Ma...
accept_22313_1=In my opinion, Master Hong Qin is suffering from heart disease, which is incurable.
accept_22314_1=Here are some rare herbs, and a set of armor and spear we got from a soldier. Hope these can help you.
accept_22315_1=It seems that I'm famous, haha. But it is not so easy to make friends with me. You must have some achievements in martial arts.
accept_22316_1=Okay, they must also appreciate you. Oh, by the way, if you have no where to go you can live here.
accept_22317_1=You know that I like to study this kind of thing? Haha. To tell you the truth, I have followed several famous poison makers since I was a child...
accept_22318_1=That person loves dog meat. Since you also have research on dog meat, you must get to know him.
accept_22319_1=I only know how to cook dog meat, but I've been cooking this dish for more than twenty years.
accept_22320_1=I know your kindness, but I don't like this kind of armor. This kind of stuff can be found everywhere...
accept_22321_1=That's right! I think you are very smart. Old Feng will like such a smart man like you.
accept_22322_1=Although your martial arts are old, I won't appreciate a simple-minded person. If you want to make friends with me, you must pass my test.
accept_22323_1=I'm also very happy, let's drink together.
accept_22325_1=I think this is a good time to eliminate the Five Demons. Here is a pack of sedatives, add it into the wine jar at their camp, and then ignite the piles of provisions to burn them.
accept_22326_1=We have all kinds of good wine here. Just go and get what you like.
accept_22327_1=Good idea. We haven't had a drink together for a long time. Now we have this opportunity, so we must have a good drink!
accept_22328_1=That's right. Today let's get drunken. This small jar of wine is not enough any more, we need to get more jars.
accept_22329_1=So you're the friend of Uncle Ma. Please save me. I was chopping wood just now, and they caught me for no reason...
accept_22330_1=What? Didn't they drink that wine...No, they must have sensed something before drinking too much. But they did drink the wine with sedatives, and they should have been greatly weakened.
accept_22331_1=I read a lot of related books and found a kind of medicine which may be useful. Let her try it.
accept_22332_1=Since this is a heart disease, I will find a way to recuperate myself. I think the secret of your life experience may be in Luoyang. If you want to get your memory back, you'd better go there. But that package has been moved, it may also be a trap, you'd better think about it first.
complete_22289=<S>Hong Qin is my master. Do you have any problem?
complete_22290=<S>Yeah, it has been like this here since the natural disaster took place...Forget it. Let's stop talking about it. I'll make medicine for my master.
complete_22291=<S>I have some knowledge about medicine but not include memory loss. I feel really sad to see my master being like this.
complete_22292=Yes, it is. I will make the medicine now.
complete_22293=Don't reason with me. I only know that my brothers will starve to death if I don't do this.
complete_22294=Good. I really admire you now.
complete_22295=You really have a method!
complete_22296=Our duty is protect the villagers from the bandits. But recently the bandits are too much so we should arrange our people, so that we need to spend more cost...
complete_22301=I should teach this kind of people a lesson, but...
complete_22302=Are you the person who defeated my heeler? That bastard surely should be beaten. Okay, I will deal with him, you can go back now.
complete_22303=I have repented, I will no longer connive my heelers to bully the common people. Please let me go!
complete_22304=But I'm still worried that they won't stop there!
complete_22305=Although the officer is dead, these soldiers will continue to oppress the common people.
complete_22306=I feel much better now, thank you.
complete_22307=I remember that my brother had given me a package a few months ago and told me that I could only open it when the right person came. I think it must be you.
complete_22308=Those are the heelers of the Cave Ghost of Shanxi. They do everything evil. Those mountain bandits are really nothing compared with them.
complete_22309=How can there be only one piece of paper? I remember there were a lot of things in the package when it was buried. Did someone take it?
complete_22310=It's me. I saw that you had eliminated the minions of Cave Ghost, good job. Why do you come to me?
complete_22313=If you can eliminate them, we will all remember your kindness.
complete_22314=Who are you? How did you get in?
complete_22315=You're young but skilled, haha. I'd like to make friends with you, hahah!
complete_22316=I see, but I'm very busy. I'm afraid I don't have time to talk to you more.
complete_22317=We are really hit it off, I must make friends with you. Come to me when you are in trouble.
complete_22318=It's very kind of you to give such a big gift the first time we meet, hahaha!
complete_22319=Oh, thank you, but the armors...
complete_22320=This is good! Hahaha...
complete_22321=It seems that they all appreciate you very much, but it is not so easy to make friends with me.
complete_22322=Good answer. Nowadays, young people like you who are both wise and skilled are really rare. I have decided to make friends with you.
complete_22323=Unexpectedly, you really have a method. Do they really have no doubt about you at all?
complete_22325=There are many bandits nearby. It's normal to be stolen here, so don't be angry.
complete_22326=This is my favorite wine. We must get drunken today!
complete_22327=Okay, let's wait for a while. I also miss the dog meat cooked by Buyou.
complete_22328=Please release me, I need to take care of my wife and child...
complete_22329=Well done, I hope we can wipe out this group of demons effortlessly.
complete_22330=The Five Demons were still powerful after being paralyzed, but you were also not losing to them, I'm so surprised.
complete_22331=I also know that I got a heart disease, but... Well, I will trust Doctor Ma, hope this medicine can work.
complete_22332=It's been bad luck lately.
context_22289=Please help me say hello to my aunt. I heard that my aunt was too sad and seriously ill because of my father's death.

context_22294=We have no choice but to do this to keep alive. Just now I saw some soldiers robbing the common people and they left. I'll obey you if you can let them mend their ways.

context_22296=The master is resting. I'll check on the situation later.         Look, here comes a soldier. He must want to loot the belongings in the name of inspection.

menu_22289_1=I'll go then, please take care.
menu_22290_1=Let me help you to collect then.
menu_22291_1=Is that the bowl of medicinal soup? I'll take it to the elder.
menu_22292_1=Don't worry. I will try to collect the medicinal materials.
menu_22293_1=You're right, this is the best solution. I'll go find him.
menu_22294_1=Okay, just wait. I'll convince you.
menu_22295_1=So what about your promise?
menu_22296_1=Don't worry, I'll deal with him.
menu_22301_1=I've always wanted to teach you a lesson.
menu_22302_1=But what?
menu_22303_1=So you exposed your nature!
menu_22304_1=I will believe you this time.
menu_22305_1=I should have killed that guy in the barracks!
menu_22306_1=I will go have a look at here.
menu_22307_1=Don't worry, take your time. I have some questions for you, elder.
menu_22308_1=Where is that package?
menu_22309_1=Then I'll leave, please take care.
menu_22310_1=Please have a rest, elder. I'll go to find Ma Banxian now.
menu_22313_1=No medicine to cure?
menu_22314_1=Thank you. I will go now.
menu_22315_1=I'd like to see your skills.
menu_22316_1=Then I'm going to visit the other four heroes.
menu_22317_1=I see. Here is a herb, I don't know if you can take a fancy to it.
menu_22318_1=Bye, see you later.
menu_22319_1=Of course!
menu_22320_1=You're right. Please wait for a while, I must make you satisfied.
menu_22321_1=I'm going to visit Elder Feng now.
menu_22322_1=I am willing to take the test.
menu_22323_1=I have been keeping a jar of good wine, let me take it.
menu_22325_1=I see, I'll go there now.
menu_22326_1=I see.
menu_22327_1=Then let me notice the other four elders.
menu_22328_1=I will go to take it now (I can burn their provision piles by this chance).
menu_22329_1=The minions of the Cave Ghost seem to be aware of something. I should kill them first.
menu_22330_1=No, they, they just...
menu_22331_1=See you, elder.
menu_22332_1=You're right. I decided to ask for the advice of Miracle Doctor Xue Muren at Ruined Valley.
