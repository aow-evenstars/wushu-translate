Why do we go to such efforts?</font>
CanAcceptMenu_49328=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Fifth Manor Lord don't joke around.  Fourth Manor Lord ordered me to help hunt beasts. This is the final beast. If I don't understand, it is hard for me to do it wholeheartedly. </font>

All creatures are trying to live. We are just like animals.  Cows and horses eat grass, tigers and wolves eat people, there is no right or wrong. People eat swine and sheep, kill bears and leopards. It is also right.  But, beasts can kill people, and people can also kill people.  Beasts kill people to live, but people kill people out of greed.

complete_49327=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >No one told you... it is a long story. How obnoxious!  But it is no good hiding it from you. Since you have gotten into so much trouble lately—and have done so much.</font>
complete_49328=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >So courageous.  You asked about this as well? Man and beast were originally equal. Inequality is because of the hearts of man.  Who is not affected by emotions?  Who can truly be entirely fair?  Living in Jianghu, loyalty is the most important. If it is for loyalty, losing your arm is worth it. You can never leave your brothers.  Do you think making a decision is easy for us? </font>
complete_49329=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Did you see those angry fellows barge into the Villa!? They want to speak with the Villa Leader. I was going to stop them but the Second Villa Leader granted them entry. </font>

complete_49344=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >... Shouldn't I say that to you? Never mind.  One of my wishes was granted today.  People always consider tigers the world's evilest creature. But if it was not made into a puppet by man, there would be no people sacrificed.  We don't try to unify the people against tyranny. Since it is none of our business, we just blindly accept it. We sacrifice the weak to save ourselves and say it is how things should be.  That is funny. We can forgive beasts that eat people, but people who eat people are unforgivable! </font>

context_49225=People often collect the hide and bones from dead beasts outside the Villa and often get hurt doing so. Persuade them to stop.
context_49226=There was a robbery in the Villa kitchen, but we have noticed some footprints.  We need to identify which animal left them.
context_49227=A passerby was hurt by a bear outside the Villa. See the hunter Shen Tian for medicine to treat the passerby.

context_49229=Elder Brother Li Shi stubborn and unwilling to settle down and practice his martial arts. The Fourth Villa Leader has attempted to correct this but to no avail. Their relationship deteriorated and Elder Brother Li Shi left the Villa. The Fourth Villa Leader wants him brought back.

context_49240=Many animals have escaped the cage and may hurt people. Hurry up and return them to their cages.  If they are unwilling, you can discipline them a bit.  But don't hurt them.
context_49241=Baby eagles that are not protected by their parents easily become the targets of other beasts.  The Villa must try to protect the young eagles.
context_49242=We have heard of the Tianxiang Tea Forest in the faraway land of Basha. The Manor Lord takes the essence of the "gold flower snake" to make the addicting "God Tea", which he uses to control people.  We don't care if they plant or bake tea to make poison, but we can not ignore that fact that they are making the snakes go extinct.  You can use our name to teach them a lesson.
context_49243=I have not been in Jianghu for many years, but I never would have thought that Tiger Roaring Villa would be founded at the foot of the small Wudang Mountain.  How dare they use the name of the tiger in vain! We cannot allow such prideful behavior!  Our fifth brother knows they will not listen. Tell them to change their name. It may be easier just to force them.
context_49245=Last time we passed Tangmen while shipping goods to Bashu, we stayed in Tangmen for a couple of days. The people were very kind.  On the way home, we were attacked by a group of bandits who used hidden weapons from Tangmen. We lost a few people.  A dozen of healthy horses gifted to us by the Tangmen people also went crazy and died.  I am not stupid. Tangmen is not brave enough to take action in their own neighborhood. It is probably someone who wants to fight us.  I heard there is a Heaven Treasure Stronghold here that does not have a good relationship with Tangmen. Go investigate. If it is true, I am going to attack their stronghold!

context_49253=Villa disciples usually train beasts and often get hurt.  There has been a lack of medicine in the Villa lately. Hurry and gather some in case of emergency.

context_49303=After a long battle, the Manor Lord finally stopped the giant eagle.  The children are safe, and the giant eagle was killed by the angry villagers.  But the village women seem to think I took the children up the mountain. It seems that we need to explain what happened.
context_49304=I did not think the child would put all the blame on me. The egg stealing villagers are using this opportunity to get revenge. Their animosity toward the Villa is hard to appease right now.  With all these things going on, did I do the wrong thing? Or are the villagers wrong? Let me tell the Manor Lord.
context_49305=A group of people are causing trouble in the Villa. What could this be about?
context_49306=I decided to join the villagers and help them capture the giant bear.  After catching the bear cub and it can be used to lure out the giant bear.
context_49307=With my help the villagers finally captured the giant bear. When asked what happened to the bears, they seemed to be hiding something. I must look into this.
context_49308=I never imagined the villagers would capture the bear, only to take its bile while it is still alive. These villagers are so cruel...
context_49309=Today I encountered a crazy woman who laments the loss of her son. Maybe there is more to her story than mere insanity.
context_49310=The Third Villa Leader admires my hunting ability and asked me to participate in the panther hunt. Unfortunately I can't wait for the Villa to ready up. I decided to hunt it myself.
context_49311=The crazy woman is dead, the man is dead, and the panther is dead.  Third Manor Lord wanted to kill the panther to get its bones, but why does he look so sad?
context_49312=I am to help the Fourth Villa Leader  hunt an illusive lion. Though it appears there may be more to this situation than meets the eye.
context_49313=The lion attacked the village. I was one step too late. One year ago, people hunted lions. A year later, lions hunted people. The lion must be looking for that couple. They are not here. I must find them. Maybe it is the only way to make peace with the Lion King.
context_49314=Although we do not know where the fierce tiger is, he always comes back to Huiyan Peak to enjoy his tributes. Fifth Manor Lord says the village respects it as a god. They hunt man before hunting the tiger. I think there is something wrong. Maybe we can find some information while the Manor Lord is preparing.
context_49316=The young man is ready to sacrifice himself and is willing to feed himself to the tiger to save his childhood friend, Jingwen the young girl.  I misunderstood him. I feel so ashamed.  I want to protect him, save the girl, and save him.
context_49317=I was not successful in persuading Jingwen, I can only hide nearby and wait for a chance.  I did not expect that the fierce tiger would easily find us hiding behind the rock.  I guess I can just try my luck.
context_49318=I have gotten all five materials, and we can soon save our benefactor.  The Manor Lord told me to prepare the banquets, and the entire Villa is celebrating.  Years of hard work have finally paid off. The five Manor Lords saw the medicine made and almost started to weep.
context_49319=The benefactor is awake, so a banquet is being held in the Villa.  We did not expect the food to be poisoned! What happened? I need to go to the backyard to check. Did someone want to hurt the Villa?
context_49320=The Villa went through this crisis and started to deteriorate.  Thinking about the process of hunting for the five beasts and the final results. Many thoughts are going through my mind. I think I finally understand what the Manor Lord was telling me.
context_49321=I confronted Xiao Cheng outside the Villa  about the chipmunk. He would not give it back and attempted to run off but was plucked away by a giant eagle. What to do…
context_49322=The giant bear angrily broke down the cage and wounded the villagers. He took the rest of the bears and escaped. The town was in shambles behind him.  I am not sure how to respond to these changes.
context_49323=I was interrupted while hunting the panther. The husband could no longer stand his crazy wife and wanted to kill her. The child that was raised by panthers was the one sold.  The husband still killed his wife and lost his life to the panther. We are speechless and are saddened by all the bodies lying around.
context_49324=You think you successfully resolve conflict, but there is actually more to it than you can imagine.
context_49325=Killing is killing. What is the difference between us and the villagers? I don't understand.
context_49327=Of the five beasts, we have already killed four.  I am still not sure why the Villa is using so many people to kill the beasts. I think Second Manor Lord said it is to save people.  What person can allow the Villa to break its own rules?
context_49328=Fifth Manor Lord finally told me the reason the Villa wants to kill the five beasts.  So that is the reason, I am shocked.
context_49343=Although, the Villa has no concern for Jianghu, but only asks when wild beasts appear in Jianghu.  The Villa has the obligation to kill those beasts.
context_49344=Yu and Jingwen both died at the mouth of the tiger. The tiger was lucky not to die and climbed to shore. I had to face it alone.  The poison is started to act up in its body. I cannot let it escape, or their act of offering themselves to the tiger would be in vain.
context_49410=The villagers near the Beggars' Sect and are being terrorized by a giant killer snake. Group together and exterminate the giant king snake.
context_49411=The villagers say that a blue-eyed tiger king has appeared near Jinling and threatening their safety. Something must be done about this blue-eyed tiger king.
context_49412=The villagers say that a giant poisonous scorpion has appeared near the Wanderer's Valley and is attacking those who venture near. This giant poisonous scorpion must be exterminated.
context_49413=The villagers are being terrorized by a giant long-armed ape. Find and exterminate the Long-Armed Ape.

CanAcceptMenu_49338=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The Beast Villa has changed me, but I am unwilling to avoid the world. I have decided to go back to Jianghu and maybe allow more people to understand the nature of our Villa. </font>

CompleteMenu_49330=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I have decided to join Beast Villa</font>
CompleteMenu_49337=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I am determined. I will not feel any regret if I leave the Villa today! (You will fully leave Beast Villa upon completing this task) </font>
accept_49244_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >A few days ago, we had a team shipping goods. When we passed Jiming Posthouse, we were stopped by a group of local bandits. They knew we were from Beast Villa, and they still blackmailed us. We convince Elder Long to help us, and the thieves let our people go but held onto our goods.  Elder brother said that it is better to not get too involved in Jianghu, but I just can't forget this incident. This occurred right at our doorstep and is an embarrassment to Beast Villa.  I just hate that I am the third oldest brother and cannot go teach those bandits a lesson personally. </font>
accept_49304_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I cannot fault you, fully. You were doing what you thought right. I fear that the demise of the giant eagle would have come to fruition sooner or later regardless.</font>
accept_49306_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Quiet!  What do you know!  Those greedy people dared to come to our Villa and cause trouble! If I knew they would do that, I would have thrown the old man and those two thugs off a cliff! Returning their traps and compensating them, we have embarrassed Beast Villa!</font>
accept_49313_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Two months ago, an old customer came up the mountain to pick medicine and was bitten to death. Witnesses say it was a red monster that did not look like a lion or dog.  The man from Beast Villa said that we shouldn't enter the mountain now.  We disagree. If they block off the mountain, what will we do for a living? The elders speculate that since the mountain was burned last year, the lion spirit has come back for revenge.  So they tied up the couple and gave a blood sacrifice. The two people were confident and said if we let them perform the ceremony, disaster can be avoided. So we believed them and gave them a huge sum of money to perform the ceremony.  Afterwards, things were quiet for a few days, and the herbalists returned safely.  Who would have thought the lion broke into the village last night and bit everyone he saw. It was a bloodbath! When we went to look for the two thieves, there was no trace of them!  They ate and drank for free for an entire year, and were not willing to sacrifice themselves. They are inhuman!</font>
accept_49314_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Yes. Stormrunner. I still need to prepare.  Let me remind you, this tiger is different from all the beasts that have come before. Even the Beast Villa has not been able to track it down or defeat it.  Don't underestimate him, or...</font>
accept_49315_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Wrong.  Wrong.  Wrong.  If it were not for tributes, why would Beast Villa have a problem with the village? If it were not for tributes, as a villager, why would I come to Beast Villa so many times and ask for help despite the danger?  Young hero, tell me, is Beast Villa confident about capturing this beast? </font>
accept_49316_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >(Bitter expression) Yes.  Five or six years ago, this tiger came out of nowhere and started to steal food and attack people and livestock.  The wizard in the village said it is an incarnation of the mountain god. If we want to avert the disaster, we should sacrifice a child to guarantee our safety for a year.  The villagers felt bad but still finally agreed.  The tiger did indeed stop for a while.  Afterwards, every year the villagers would give sacrifices to gain peace.  Beast Villa also sent people to stop the sacrifices and capture the tiger, but they did not succeed and the village was attacked the next day. So tension began between the village and Beast Villa... Young Hero, I am thirsty. Can we get some wine to calm my nerves? </font>
accept_49317_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The wine is gone. The people leave. Meeting you today, Young Hero, is like meeting an old friend. I still have some matters to attend to and must leave. Actually, to tell you the truth, the wizard knew that Beast Villa would come stop them and took the girl for sacrifice down another road. The place for sacrifice is at another location.  I don't know how the giant tiger finds the different locations each time, I bet there is way to summon it.  Young Hero you should notify the Villa to search the mountain. I hope we can stop the tiger and allow my village to have peace again and stop the sacrifices. </font>
accept_49319_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >... This altar, this altar, and this altar too! This wine tastes good and is very fragrant. Why didn't I realize it before!? You, you! Where did you get this wine from? How dare you! Causing trouble around Beast Villa! Are you a spy sent by the royal court!?</font>
accept_49337_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >How dare you!  Betray the Villa?  Hmph, you are a fool who cannot finish what you started. You are not worth keeping.  However, Beast Villa has existed for hundreds of years and no one has ever dared to look down on the ideas of our Villa. No one has been bold to say such things and just leave! </font>
complete_49244=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Everyone knows about it, so of course they will know about it too.  Unfortunately you are helpless to defend yourself. Your entire mountain cannot defeat one disciple from Beast Villa. How will you compete in Jianghu in the future!? Ha-ha! I am going to tell the elder brothers. They may not say it, but they will be very happy.</font>
complete_49304=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Maybe someday they will, but by then, creatures such as the giant eagle may already be extinct. Relax your mind on this subject for now. You will finally understand these principles someday.  For now, the Second Manor Lord is rounding up a team to hunt a giant bear.  Help him with this task. Maybe by doing so you will develop a new understanding toward humanity and animals. </font>
complete_49306=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I see. A clever idea indeed. If this works, you will always be known as a friend of the  Zhao family! Alright, everything is ready. Let us be off!</font>
complete_49311=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ah, I was told about you. Beast Villa relies on ability, not luck.  If you try to take the easy route you will die and disrespect us. I will give you a chance. If you cannot fulfill my needs and expectations, then for your sake you'd better stay as far from me as possible. </font>
complete_49316=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What is the point of having a crush?  She is dying for the village and would never run away with me. The creature is so strong, even the Beast Villa can do nothing. I have no choice now.  Strong man!  The wine is good wine, and the person is a good person. I was able to get everything off my chest tonight, and I have no regrets.  Destiny has brought us together. Why don't you have a drink with me?</font>

submit_49313=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >People always brag about love and sacrifice. But when it involves their personal benefits, they change their story quickly. It is because the villagers questioned Beast Villa and recruited a bad hunter who took numerous lives on the mountain through fire. The hunter selfishly sacrificed the young lion, and the tragedy is because the lion king that survived was seeking revenge.  However, these people never felt a bit of remorse. The villagers are remorseful, but it is because they are worried about their own lives. They cruelly abandoned the hunter but let the two people go because of greed and foolishness. When the hunter and his wife was facing the lion, they blamed each other and died meaningfully. </font>
