CompleteMenu_22721=Now I finally understand.
CompleteMenu_22724=Is this your stolen silver?
CompleteMenu_22726=I chased off those Wandering Doctors, so now you can enjoy some peace. It is better to have peace than trouble. You should make peace with the Flying Eagle Stockade. A long battle is good for no one.
CompleteMenu_22728=Tu Erdan said you are badly injured. Let me see.
CompleteMenu_22731=I am here to represent the Prairie Wolf Guild and to ask for peace. It is better to have peace than trouble. A long battle is good for no one. This is a letter from the Prairie Wolf Guild leader Yan Linshan.
CompleteMenu_22733=I killed the Lord Courtyard Patrol Guards.
CompleteMenu_22736=Argh. You guys…
CompleteMenu_22739=I got the wine.
CompleteMenu_22740=Now you can behave!
CompleteMenu_22742=Who are you? What are you doing here?
CompleteMenu_22745=We already took care most of those cursed Jianghu enemies.
CompleteMenu_22748=These are the jewels and silk fabric we took back. Have a look.
CompleteMenu_22750=The Military Advisor has calculated that there were only a few things destroyed and a few casualties.
CompleteMenu_22751=The Head Leader wants to host a feast for our friends. He wants you and Military Advisor to make preparations.
CompleteMenu_22752=This is the Horse Meat Second Lord wanted me to get.
CompleteMenu_22753=Everything is ready and the feast can begin.
CompleteMenu_22754=What do you think of my answer?
CompleteMenu_22755=I passed Qin Lu the message.
CompleteMenu_22758=How is it going over here?
CompleteMenu_22759=Aaargh!
CompleteMenu_22760=It is you again…
CompleteMenu_22761=Considering you are a real man, I will spare you a fighting chance, so you can lose without regrets.
CompleteMenu_22763=This is the key. Since you are a real, man I will not kill you.
CompleteMenu_22764=I just received news from the Imperial Court. Katata Emperor's Teacher's Flying Tiger Barrack Cavalry has been defeated.
CompleteMenu_22765=Most of the Hans already retreated to the pass.
CompleteMenu_22766=The Emperor's Teacher is dead, but their army is now leaderless and roaming around making trouble. Do you have a solution?
CompleteMenu_22767=The wolves and martial artists on the southern grassland have already been taken care of.
CompleteMenu_22768=In order to keep the peace in Central Plains we need to trade with the Mongolians. Only supplying enough salt, iron, food, and tea for their needs can stop them from invading us.
accept_22721_1=If so then I wish you a safe journey. Take care.
accept_22724_1=(If I return back with a professional like this the Head Leader might even give me a reward) You just got here and do not have a place to stay. My Guild Leader loves to make friends with the heroes from Jianghu. Let me take you to meet him.
accept_22726_1=You are famous even here in the frontier fortresses. My Head Leader admires you and have sent people over. He wants to have a drink with you.
accept_22728_1=Thank you for looking out for us. As long as Flying Eagle Stockade Head Leader Yuan Buqu does not steal our businesses I will listen to you. I will write a letter for you to take to Yuan Buqu. To show Prairie Wolf Guild's goodwill.
accept_22731_1=I got shot by Imperial Court Guard's poisoned arrow. Ugh. Looks like I will lose this leg.
accept_22733_1=I got news the Katata Imperial Court is gathering army and might invade Central Plains. We are all Hans. Go check it out.
accept_22736_1=We must act quickly. Hurry and go.
accept_22739_1=There are too few of us compared to the Imperial Court's army. We must have a plan. Go get some wine. We will use fire to attack them.
accept_22740_1=Take a team and sneak in from the north. Burn their tents and supplies, and cause a distraction. I will take the rest and attack from the south.
accept_22742_1=I will take you to the Emperor's Teacher right now if you do not kill me.
accept_22745_1=You… You are Han. I have never killed any Hans. I admire you guys so please do not kill me.
accept_22748_1=Years of savings… Help me ask the Military Advisor about our losses.
accept_22750_1=Go tell Head Leader about the situation. Oh yes. We got the jewels and silk fabric back. He does not need to know about this.

accept_22752_1=The conditions are harsh here in the frontier fortresses. I heard there are a lot of wild horses nearby. Can you see if you can bring back some Horse Meat and give it to Military Advisor? We will serve it with wine.
accept_22753_1=Go tell the Second Lord everything is ready and the feast can begin.
accept_22754_1=I admire your martial arts. The feast needs some entertainment, so can you do a sword dance with me and spar for fun?
accept_22755_1=A Guild Member came with a message. He said a Beggars' disciple named Hu Jiabao is looking for you.
accept_22758_1=Go find Qin Lu.
accept_22759_1=Me and Beggars' disciples have been watching the Imperial Court. It is strange that no one is getting in or out, and it is very quiet. But we can see a lot of shadows from inside the tents.
accept_22760_1=Let's take care of the enemies first.
accept_22761_1=(A very grateful Katata Khan) If you help me take the throne back, I will make you my General, Emperor's Teacher, and you can have anything you want.
accept_22763_1=The key to this lock is in the hands of Emperor's Teacher's Bodyguard…
accept_22764_1=I will remember I owe you my life. The Emperor's Teacher is setting you guys up.

If you want to defeat him you must first defeat his Flying Tiger Barrack Cavalry.
accept_22765_1=He is leading the Rebel Colonel to kill Hans. Let's go kill the Rebel Colonel and Emperor's Teacher. Then escort the Hans away.
accept_22766_1=The Emperor's Teacher is already dead but there are too many Mongolian Soldiers. Think of a plan.
accept_22767_1=I owe you my life but I can't only think of myself and not of my people. A lot of Man-Eating Wolves have appeared on the southern grasslands. We can't herd horses there anymore. Food supplies are getting low so we can only move south...
accept_22768_1=If you can persuade the Hans to trade fairly with us Mongolians and satisfy our needs of food, salt, iron, and tea, then I will persuade all of Mongolia so that as long as I am alive that no Mongolian Soldier will set foot in the Central Plains.
complete_22721=That is what happened. It was a misunderstanding. You must excuse me.
complete_22724=I am so grateful for your help…
complete_22726=Many thanks. It's as if you saved everyone in Prairie Wolf Guild. If you need anything later, just let us know. We are friends now.
complete_22728=Oh, thank you. This wound was always swollen and was not getting any better.
complete_22731=You saved my brother Ge Sang. I will keep your advice in mind. I do not want my friends to risk their lives everyday either.
complete_22733=Ha… That was close!
complete_22736=How embarrassing. It was all because of pride. Our Prairie Wolf Guild is the number one guild here, so how can we lose to the Flying Eagle Stockade?
complete_22739=Great. Now we have a good chance of winning.
complete_22740=Don't! I will do whatever you want me to do. Do not kill me!
complete_22742=I… I am Katata Khan. Do not kill me. I… I can give you money. I can make you a governor.
complete_22745=Thanks again for help. These cursed rascals…
complete_22748=Oh thanks. Good thing they are all back.
complete_22750=That is good… That is good… You must be tired.
complete_22751=No problem. We have not celebrated for so long.
complete_22752=Great. Thank you.
complete_22753=Alright.
complete_22754=Your martial arts really are great. I learned many things.
complete_22755=Okay. I will try my best to recruit those people of Jianghu.
complete_22758=Let me explain it to you.
complete_22759=It is you!
complete_22760=You… My savior! Help me!
complete_22761=Hmph! Show me how I will lose without regrets…
complete_22763=You... I...
complete_22765=That is great. Those Mongolian Soldiers are vicious!
complete_22766=You saved my life. So let me take care of this. I will go gather them.
complete_22767=Really? Is it true? Thank you guys so much! I never wanted the sons of the grassland to live in a time of unrest either.
complete_22768=Alright! The Prairie Wolf Guild will take care of it. We can also get many high-quality horses and wool from them!
