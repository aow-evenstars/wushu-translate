context_75219=Helping Clearheaven Palace disciples get out of their Possessed state requires three steps: Firstly, block Yin-Yang energy from reaching Clearheaven Palace disciples.

Thirdly, at this point the Clearheaven Palace disciples have come out of their Possessed state and need to absorb Yin and Yang energy to heal. Only by working together can we achieve our goal.
