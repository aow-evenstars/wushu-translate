
CanAcceptMenu_34386=Meeting an old friend in a distant land. I run into you when I just arrived in Yanjing.
CanAcceptMenu_34387=I heard that Lord Qin is ambitious, but I know little about the two lords' attitudes towards martial arts.
CanAcceptMenu_34388=Huh, so you've been following me. Who are you?
CanAcceptMenu_34389=You are lucky. I must ask Dongfang Zhengde about it
CanAcceptMenu_34390=Thanks for your instruction, Leader.
CanAcceptMenu_34391=I will help the villagers. What can I do?
CanAcceptMenu_34392=The Youming Palace will have to answer to me.
CanAcceptMenu_34393=Elder, I'll collect some herbal medicines and apologize to the brothers.
CanAcceptMenu_34394=I'm off to free the captives in Youming Palace!
CanAcceptMenu_34395=The Youming Palace shall answer for their crimes!
CanAcceptMenu_34396=Tell me, where is the Palace Leader? I'll kill you if you don't.
CanAcceptMenu_34397=It's late. I have to go back.
CanAcceptMenu_34398=Someone told me the goods heading to Yellow Village were stolen.
CanAcceptMenu_34399=I was asked to get the goods back for you.
CanAcceptMenu_34400=You're welcome, Helmsman. I must leave now.
CanAcceptMenu_34401=I don't know how to help you.
CanAcceptMenu_34402=Where do Shuangming Mushrooms grow?
CanAcceptMenu_34403=How can I find the Palace Leader?
CanAcceptMenu_34404=How has palace leader been lately?
CanAcceptMenu_34405=I'm nobody. I was entrusted by the Foster Daughter of Palace Leader.
CanAcceptMenu_34406=Why do you roar with laughter after taking the Antidote?
CanAcceptMenu_34407=My mind is made up. I must leave now.
CanAcceptMenu_34408=I had conflict with your Palace when I relieved the Villagers of Yellow. I knew the Foster Daughter of First Palace Leader, so I sent the medicine, but I was insulted for many times.
CanAcceptMenu_34409=Waiter, I want some nice food and liquor.
CanAcceptMenu_34410=I'll go to Muyun Villa now.
CanAcceptMenu_34411=Is the Leader in the Villa?
CanAcceptMenu_34412=You seem to be in a good mood. Let me visit your villa.
CanAcceptMenu_34413=Villa Leader, what's the matter with you?
CanAcceptMenu_34414=You are the woman who escaped in Yanjng Inn, aren't you?
CanAcceptMenu_34415=He even poisoned others for a stupid book. He should be put to death.
CanAcceptMenu_34416=I hand you over to the Guard. Don't play tricks.
CanAcceptMenu_34417=Villa Leader asked me to get the person. Where is the woman?
CanAcceptMenu_34418=Brother, why are you wounded seriously? Why do you come to the Ancient Tomb?
CanAcceptMenu_34419=Go ahead, Dharmapala Zhang. I'll try my best to help you.
CanAcceptMenu_34420=What else can I do for you?
CanAcceptMenu_34421=Miss Long, you're a member of Ancient Tomb Sect, aren't you?
CanAcceptMenu_34422=What is the important thing? Need my help?
CanAcceptMenu_34423=I found this Letter on a Disciple of Killers' Manor.
CanAcceptMenu_34424=I found a Secret Letter let out by your Traitor from a Scout of Killers' Manor. I've got rid of him for you.
CanAcceptMenu_34425=Headmaster, I've long heard of the bee syrup. Why does it have such an efficacy?
CanAcceptMenu_34426=Why does Secret Association want to poison your Headmaster?
CanAcceptMenu_34427=Compared with such an important thing, my experience is not worth mentioning at all.
CompleteMenu_34386=I heard that Brother Ding is the good friend of Lord Qin?
CompleteMenu_34387=I am inexperienced so I may not be able to handle those under Lord Qin.
CompleteMenu_34388=What's your purpose?
CompleteMenu_34389=I've never seen this Evil Skill.
CompleteMenu_34390=The villagers have had a tough time.
CompleteMenu_34391=I've defeated the Horse Thieves. You can be relieved.
CompleteMenu_34392=You are quite skilled. I am sorry I tried to take out my anger on the villagers.
CompleteMenu_34393=I've come to uphold justice and get rid of the evil for the people!
CompleteMenu_34394=I'll keep their reinforcements busy while the villagers make their escape.
CompleteMenu_34395=Come clean if you want to be alive!
CompleteMenu_34396=You don't need to salute.
CompleteMenu_34397=What I said is true.
CompleteMenu_34398=Goodbye, elder.
CompleteMenu_34399=I got back the goods and punished those officials.
CompleteMenu_34400=Let me think.
CompleteMenu_34401=This is Matinal Laurel Dew. I'll go to find Shuangming Mushroom.
CompleteMenu_34402=Now they're complete. You can mix the medicines to prepare the Antidote.
CompleteMenu_34403=Right? This can't baffle me.
CompleteMenu_34404=I've brought the Antidote. Please take it, Leader.
CompleteMenu_34405=This is Antidote. I've taken it.
CompleteMenu_34406=Want me to join in? It's a wishful thinking!
CompleteMenu_34407=The Foster Daughter of First Palace Leader asked me to send the Antidote, but the Palace Leader embarrassed me. Please help me get away, Second Palace Leader.
CompleteMenu_34408=How are you, waiter?
CompleteMenu_34409=So Muyun Villa is mysterious.
CompleteMenu_34410=Now I can meet the Villa Leader, right?
CompleteMenu_34411=So, it's a misunderstanding.
CompleteMenu_34412=I've got it done
CompleteMenu_34413=Hmm, I'll catch her.
CompleteMenu_34414=In this case, we'd better make a deal. You give me the Antidote, and I make it easy on you.
CompleteMenu_34415=You've been seriously injured. You can't escape.
CompleteMenu_34416=How to dispose of the Woman?
CompleteMenu_34417=I'll go to Ancient Tomb Sect and check it out by all means!
CompleteMenu_34418=Thank you, Dharmapala Zhang.
CompleteMenu_34419=Dharmapala Zhang, I've brought back the Letter.
CompleteMenu_34420=Calm your anger, Headmaster.
CompleteMenu_34421=Thank you.
CompleteMenu_34422=I found this from a Scout.
CompleteMenu_34423=I've met Miss Dongfang. I also met some strange things at that time.
CompleteMenu_34424=Hmm, thank you very much, Headmaster.
CompleteMenu_34425=You're very kind, Brother Zhang.
CompleteMenu_34426=We can't let their trick succeed.

accept_34397_1=<s>Here, I have something for you.
accept_34398_1=<s>Just so. Just now someone recognized you. Anyway, we explained to him and avoided misunderstanding.
accept_34399_1=Punish the patrolmen - the goods should be on them.
accept_34400_1=<s>I saw a woman in black following you. Please be careful.
accept_34401_1=<s>Matinal Laurel Dew and Shuangming Mushroom are needed for the treatment. They must be prepared into medicine, but both Medical Materials are rare. A villager told me that there is Matinal Laurel Dew in Ju Jia nearby.
accept_34402_1=<s>Shuangming Mushrooms grow in the Mingshuang Mushroom Thicket in the Cave Ghost Cavern.

accept_34414_1=<s>Yes, it's me. You discovered me in Yanjing Inn.
accept_34415_1=<s>Nine Yin Diagram is the most valuable of treasures. If I get it, the Five-Immortal Sect will rule all.

complete_34386=<s>Lord Qin had a different view of martial arts than Emperor Jianwen and Lord Yan.
complete_34387=<s>It seems someone is following you.
complete_34388=Inquire about it by yourself if you want to know! All that avails is flight.
complete_34389=<s>The woman has bad intentions. Be careful.
complete_34390=<s>We've suffered by the Disaster of Yellow River Flooding.
complete_34391=<s>Thanks for your great kindness.
complete_34392=<s>I'll deal with those disciples according to the Beggar's Sect Rules.
