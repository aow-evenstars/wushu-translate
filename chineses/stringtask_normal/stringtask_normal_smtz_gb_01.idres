complete_87200=Great. We exactly need these medicines now.
complete_87201=Well done! We can't just sit by and watch these commoners suffer.
complete_87202=Well done. You deserve to be called as the Beggar's Sect Disciple.
complete_87203=So, Beasts Mountain Villa will probably make a concession.
complete_87204=Someone was misleading us with false information!
complete_87205=If we do like that, it will be too good for those Tianxiang Bandits.
complete_87206=We misunderstood that, didn't we?
complete_87207=You did everything appropriately during this trip to the Green Cloud Castle. You are such a good member of Beggar's Sect.
complete_87208=As the Beggar's Sect disciples, it's our duty to have a strong sense of justice and to be ready to help the weak.
complete_87209=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">If we just let these Gangsters leave, our reputation of the Beggar's Sect will be affected. </font>
complete_87210=You can fight a hundred battles with no danger of defeat if you know yourself as well as the enemy. Now, it's all over. Go and have a rest.
complete_87211=Our disciples must only punish those who deserve to be punished.
complete_87212=Who will challenge us here?
complete_87213=I have never thought you have such good skills as you are so young.
complete_87214=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">  </font> <font face="Default" color="#ffffff">Some gangsters want to make trouble for the Beggar's Sect. They look down upon us. You need to enhance our patrols. Don't let the Beggar's Sect get into any trouble.</font>
complete_87215=Beggar's Sect disciples will keep their promises. That's what it should be.
complete_87216=Being as you dare to behave so wildly in the Beggar's Sect, you must know we will have our revenge.
complete_87217=Have the injured disciples recovered yet?
complete_87218=If Beggar's Sect disciples duel with Scholar apprentices, their martial arts will be improved.
complete_87219=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">Did Miss Huo decide to retire voluntarily? We need to find that out. You can go now.</font>
complete_87220=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">After this battle, Mount Song Sword Sect would keep quiet for a while. If they dare misbehave themselves again, we won't forgive them!</font>
context_87200=The Beggar's Sect has tens of thousands of disciples, however due to our growing numbers, we are beginning to run short on supplies. If you can bring some more supplies back to our sect, you will surely earn the respect of our members.
context_87201=According to our disciples, Zhao Ziji, a well-known assassin, is being harassed by some of his former enemies, led by a descendant of the Han family named Han Sijin. Zhao Ziji is quite well respected by our sect, so we must head down to Twilight Village and help him, along with his fellow villagers.
context_87202=Various gangs have been joining forces to rob escort carts. As this situation is becoming quite urgent, we'll need to to go to each of the escort agencies and investigate, while providing as much help as possible.
context_87203=Many of our disciples are being harassed by members of Beasts Mountain Villa. I'll need you to head over to the villa and issue them a formal warning.
context_87204=The Huanhua Sword Sect have been aligning themselves with many evil factions, which leaves me to believe that they must be hiding something. Take the order of the Beggar's Sect, and head over to Huanhua Sword Sect to investigate the recent actions of Jiang Zuntang.
context_87205=Tianxiang Tea Forest has colluded with bandits. The people in Qiandeng Town have suffered a lot. Here is the order of Beggar's Sect. Don't let Tianxiang Tea Forest have their own way. All Beggar's Sect disciples, go with your fellows and arrest all the members of Tianxiang Tea Forest to avoid more troubles.
context_87206=Beggar's Sect disciples reported that Wang Xiao of the Royal Guards and Golden Needle Sect Second Young Master Shen Xiyu seem to be very close. Shen Canghai, Xiyu's father, may not  be aware of this. We can't allow the Royal Guards to form this alliance. Go to the Golden Needle Sect, and find out what is really going on.
context_87207=Our leader has ordered us to help investigate all of the recent deaths in Green Cloud Castle. It appears that most other factions are too afraid to investigate themselves.
context_87208=To our dismay, some of our disciples have been involved in many recent kidnappings. If we allow this to continue, the problem will only get worse. All of us need to take action, rescue the captives and restore peace to this great land.
context_87209=Recently, many members of other sects have been trying to steal our intelligence. We can't allow these people to tarnish our reputation! I'll need everyone to patrol and guard the Mountain Gate!
context_87210=In order to remain prepared for any possible conflict, we try to gather as much intelligence as possible about the other sects. For this reason, I'll need you to head over and investigate the Emei, since we have been noticing some of their older members trying to sneak into our sect. If you can gather anything notable, you will be richly rewarded!
context_87211=As a Beggar's Sect disciple, I must bring wanted criminals to justice.
context_87212=We should gather as much intelligence as we can while keeping our channels of communication open with Shaolin, Wudang and Emei so they can remain prepared for war.
context_87213=The leader has decided to test our martial arts skills at regular intervals. Only those that have passed his test can study more advanced martial arts.
context_87214=Many unknown men have been seen wandering around within our sect, which has me quite worried. We must uncover their true intentions.
context_87215=Now it appears that the Salt Gang of Yanyu Villa may be planning something. Please go and investigate.
context_87216=I've been notified that Tiger Roaring Villa have kidnapped some of our disciples and killed many of the nearby villagers. We definitely cannot stand for such flagrant provocation! We ride for Tiger Roaring Villa immediately.
context_87218=We have recently reached an agreement with the Scholars to allow us to engage in friendly duels with one another. All of our disciples can participate, though only the winners will be allowed to study one of our unique skills.
context_87219=Huo Xinran, the daughter of one of our late elders, mysteriously disappeared ten years ago without a single trace. Now one of the visitors today is telling me that he spotted her with the Tangmen.
context_87220=Mount Song Sword Sect recently aligned itself with a new evil faction, and have since been attacking our disciples! Do they really think that we are incapable of fighting back?
submit_87200=It's my pleasure to do work for our sect.
submit_87201=Thank you, Leader! I will keep your instructions in mind.
submit_87202=Thanks for your compliment, Leader.
submit_87203=I thought the Beasts Mountain Villa must have learnt the lesson.
submit_87204=Leader, you can be at ease since everything has come out to light.
submit_87205=Leader, please feel at ease. Nobody has ever escaped.
submit_87206=Leader, though there wasn't anything to be found, it didn't mean that Royal Guards had nothing with Shen Fmaily.
submit_87207=Thanks for your compliment, Leader.
submit_87208=You are wise, my elder.
submit_87209=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">Leader, please feel at ease, since they definitely can't get out of the Beggar's Sect. </font>
submit_87210=Thanks very much for your consideration, Leader. I shall depart now..
submit_87211=Leader you are so heroic that you made me admire you since long before.
submit_87212=The matter has been settled. Excuse me.
submit_87213=Thanks for your compliment, Leader.
submit_87214=I will consistently obey Leader's teaching.
submit_87215=I will consistently obey Leader's teaching.
submit_87216=Leader, please don't worry. The Tiger Roaring Villa absolutely dare not challenge our Beggar's Sect's power.
submit_87217=Leader, please feel at ease, for most of them are ok now.
submit_87218=Leader, you are so right.
