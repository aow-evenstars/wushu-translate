CanAcceptMenu_34073=Can I help you with anything?
CanAcceptMenu_34074=How are you, Brother Hong?
CanAcceptMenu_34075=I wonder what is going on…
CanAcceptMenu_34076=I've got one plan. I wonder how I can make a false charge against the Seven-star Pond?

CanAcceptMenu_34078=I've got a secret letter for the Old Hilt.
CanAcceptMenu_34079=I wonder what Commander Huang says in the letter?
CanAcceptMenu_34080=I want to meet the leader of Seven-star Pond for something urgent. You know, it has something to do with the fate of Seven-star Pond. We can wait for no moment.
CanAcceptMenu_34083=I face a false charge by the Royal Guards. In this way, I'm misunderstood as the running dog of Royal Guards.
CanAcceptMenu_34085=Protect the Seven-star Pond? What do you mean indeed?
CanAcceptMenu_34086=Die? What do you mean?
CanAcceptMenu_34087=I hope the pond leader can tell the truth. There must be some secrets.
CanAcceptMenu_34088=Everything is urgent. What does the pond leader plan to do?
CanAcceptMenu_34089=Pond leader, excuse me, I want to know your idea now.
CanAcceptMenu_34090=Ma Tian is full of tricks. Anything new?
CanAcceptMenu_34091=Well, what secret plan do you have? Come on, say whatever you know.
CanAcceptMenu_34092=I'll let you go only if you can help me kill all members of the Royal Guard.
CanAcceptMenu_34093=This mission reaps a lot. Look, we've caught Ma Tian. Pond Leader, how about your next plan?
CanAcceptMenu_34094=Pond Leader, wait a moment! I'm to kill those trackers of Salt Gang.
CanAcceptMenu_34095=Once Ma Tian dies, Salt Gang will never let it go. Pond Leader, think it over, please.
CanAcceptMenu_34096=Leader, thanks for believing me. I will help Seven-star Pond whenever you need me.
CanAcceptMenu_34097=Everything is clear now. I'm to go off now.
CanAcceptMenu_34098=I'm going to Jiangnan. Goodbye!
CanAcceptMenu_34099=Who are you? Why do you stand in my way?
CanAcceptMenu_34100=Taoist, I help the Seven-star Pond see through the tricks of Royal Guards. Now Dragon-Subduing is trying to kill me.
CanAcceptMenu_34101=Taoist, what medicine are you preparing now?
CanAcceptMenu_34102=Taoist, many thanks? Otherwise, I'd have died in Chengdu.
CanAcceptMenu_34103=Taoist, many thanks for your help. To prove my innocence, I've got to visit the Royal Guards in person.
CanAcceptMenu_34104=Eldest daughter? I'm only a passer-by.
CanAcceptMenu_34105=How can we allow our eldest daughter to be kidnapped?
CanAcceptMenu_34106=What happened?
CanAcceptMenu_34107=I'm here to rescue the Eldest daughter from Weiyuan Escort Agency. You think I'll leave now?
CanAcceptMenu_34108=Girl, hurry back now. The people in escort agency are worried about you.
CanAcceptMenu_34109=Brother Hu, what's up? You look rather upset.
CanAcceptMenu_34110=Brother Hu, I've got to say goodbye here? If we meet in the future, we'll drink together.
CanAcceptMenu_34111=Come on, what happens to him? You seem not to eat for ages.
CanAcceptMenu_34112=You've got a full stomach. Well, it's time to start my trip now.
CanAcceptMenu_34113=If I find you have eaten the children, I will kill you.
CanAcceptMenu_34114=Miss, you're neatly dressed, but why do you beg here?
CanAcceptMenu_34115=Is that person the Avaricious Man of Devil Sect? I'll have a look where he escapes to.
CanAcceptMenu_34116=So you don't have to beg again, right?
CanAcceptMenu_34117=Why people of Devil's Gate keep harassing you? What happened?
CanAcceptMenu_34118=What can I do now?
CanAcceptMenu_34119=Then goodbye! You need to be careful.
CanAcceptMenu_34120=Unexpectedly, we can meet again in Yanjing. Why do you look for me again?
CanAcceptMenu_34121=Thank you very much. Actually, I'm just a server of the Chengdu Teahouse.
CanAcceptMenu_34122=Why does he hate Royal Guards so much?
CanAcceptMenu_34123=Chief Escort Leader, thank you. With your prestige, I can escape from many accusations which frame up upon me.
CanAcceptMenu_34124=I'll leave right now. Chief Escort Leader, meet again someday.
CanAcceptMenu_34125=Wait here, I'll go to the Herb Store and get some Medicinal Herbs.

CanAcceptMenu_34127=Wait me? Too bad, there must be an ambush.
CanAcceptMenu_34128=You, you… You are so rithless. Give me the Antidote or I will kill you.
CanAcceptMenu_34129=No, I must find the Antidote for you.
CanAcceptMenu_34130=Those people of Five Immortal Sect lurked there in advance, and then they put down poison suddenly.

CompleteMenu_34099=You're the well-known Taoist Chong Xu? When did you get here?
CompleteMenu_34100=Taoist, I've got the Red grass here. I don't know the Red grass can work wonder.

CompleteMenu_34120=I've heard a lot about you.

accept_34071_1=<s>Do you know where it is?
accept_34072_1=I'll never trust those strangers, unless the commander tells me otherwise.
accept_34073_1=I'm reporting the Royal Guards to the deputy leader Ma Tian. Could you escort me there?
accept_34074_1=I'm ready to approach the deputy leader. You should speak with him first.
accept_34075_1=<s>It is for the matter of damned Seven-Star Pond that I come to ask Commmander Huang for help.
accept_34079_1=<s>Just as I thought, I have asked someone to deliver a message to Seven-Star Pond and I'm waiting for their reply.
accept_34080_1=Let's go meet the Seven-Star Pond's leader.
accept_34081_1=<s>I'll never believe that man. Ask my son or Zhou Huang from the Seven-Star Pond.
accept_34082_1=I haven't yet made a decision. Two of my daughters are currently in Sigh City comforting the villagers there, who had been violated by some mountain thieves. Yes, they may just be women, but  they are the most capable and agile women in the Six-Star Pond.
accept_34083_1=Ha!  You think I'll actually believe you? (A mob of people suddenly approaches!) Who's that?
accept_34084_1=<s>The person I dispatched has returned, so let's see what news he brings.
accept_34086_1=The Seven-Star Pond has become part of the Royal Guards. Let's flee.
accept_34090_1=Ma Tian is always talking at random to delay on purpose. I think it's a trick.
accept_34091_1=We've caught you! You'll die here.
accept_34092_1=It's hard. Say something else.
accept_34093_1=What have the disciples of the Seven-Star Pond come for?
accept_34094_1=Thank you. We shall never again align ourselves with such an evil sect.
accept_34095_1=Ah, just what I want! The Seven-Star Pond shall always remain opposed to the Salt Gang and Royal Guards. However, I can't let Ma Tian off. Kill him, then loot his body. I can then announce to the whole martial arts world that we will never align ourselves with the Royal Guards.
accept_34096_1=I've heard a lot about you,  you're quite well known!
accept_34097_1=<s>Don't you want to stay at Seven-Star Pond and fight the Salt Gang and Royal Guards?
accept_34098_1=Have a nice trip!
accept_34101_1=This banned medicine can effectively enhance your Energy a hundredfold. But you must restrict it to small doses, or risk suffering serious side-effects.  As the situation is urgent, however, take the medicine as soon as possible!
accept_34103_1=Be careful, the Royal Guards are wicked and merciless.
accept_34104_1=You kidnapped her! Give her back!
accept_34105_1=<s>Please help us look for the eldest daughter on your way to Yanjing.
accept_34106_1=<s>Recently, tigers have been causing a lot of trouble in the mountains. Can you find the so-called 'weird man' who lives amongst them?
accept_34107_1=<s>You asked for it! Don't do it the hard way! This girl is so pretty. It's my first time to see such a beautiful woman. I'll get her!
accept_34108_1=<s>I know, it's because of this bundle. In fact, what they escort is not something true. Since the escorted goods are precious, I'm afraid of any possible problem. Leave the escorted goods inside the bundle. Give it to Hu Yongyi. I've got something to handle at first.
accept_34109_1=They are the Persian sacred goods delivered from Chengdu by the chief secretary of Yanjing. If we had known they were so important we would have sent the chief escort leader. Thanks.
accept_34110_1=<s>Be careful. There are many Devil Sect disciples in Yanjing.
accept_34111_1=<s>I'm extremely hungry. Or I may die of Nutrition.
accept_34112_1=<s>Kind person, don't go, and I'm still hungry and almost starve to death. I still want to eat something!
accept_34113_1=I won't eat any more humans, but I may die of hunger.
accept_34114_1=<s>I'm a Nishang Palace Disciple. I come to Yanjing on business under order of my Elder Martial Sister. I didn't expect Sachet with Money would be stolen by the Avaricious Man of Devil's Gate. I can do nothing without money.
accept_34115_1=<s> I can't defeat that guy. Could you retrieve my sachet from him?
accept_34116_1=I can tell you're not a local. What are you doing in Yanjing?
accept_34117_1=I must start with elder martial sister who asked me to come to Yanjing. Anyway, promise me not to tell others.
accept_34118_1=Two people of Devil's Gate are hanging about in the Suburb of Yanjing. Can you help me kill them?
accept_34119_1=A person just gave me this jade plate. He said you would know what happened if you took it to the inn.
accept_34120_1=My father insisted on thanking you for your bravery in person.
accept_34121_1=So you are the waiter everyone is talking about...
accept_34122_1=My son is a greenhorn. He met rascals of Royal Guards when he escorted goods for the first time. They grabbed all the goods. This damaged his confidence, so he hates them very much.
accept_34123_1=<s>You are quite skilled. Why don't you stay with our escort agency?
accept_34124_1=Say hello to Zhuo Shishi before you leave. You know each other anyway.
accept_34125_1=Go but come back quickly. Jin Zhuni of Five-Immortal Sect is near, and she may find me.
accept_34126_1=She is the Dharmapala of Five-immortal Sect. She excels in martial arts, and is not a common person. Be careful when you meet her.
accept_34127_1=<s>You're smart, but it's too late.
accept_34128_1=You really think I'll just hand it over?
accept_34129_1=Cough...cough...it's useless...Don't strain your brain for nothing...This...is the unique medicine of Five-immortal Sect. No one has the Antidote except for their people. Common Five-immortal Sect Disciples don't have the Antidote. I only worry about my naive youngest martial sister Lan Qinge. Please go to see her.
accept_34130_1=<s>Isn't there anything you can do to save her?
accept_34131_1=I don't feel well, but they tell me I will live. Please visit me if you ever need the assistance of Nishang Palace in the future.
accept_34132_1=<s>Now, enter the Martial Arts School and duel with your Elder Brother. Do not fight him with your hands, or your mind. Fight with your heart, and you will defeat him.
accept_34134_1=I have nothing more to teach you. Return to your master.
accept_34139_1=<s>Oh good. He has been cranky all morning.  Go on in!
accept_34140_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">Finally! Hand it over already! Wait a minute... this box is only half full! Are you trying to cheat me?</font>
accept_34141_1=<s>This is the figure of my granddaughter. I took this and inquired around then I arrived here. You can take it as a token.
accept_34142_1=<s>You are wading into dangerous waters, you little fool. Leave now!
accept_34143_1=<s>What will you do now? Someone sold my daughter to that brothel, and you cost them greatly when you released her. They will be hunting for you!
accept_34144_1=<s>So? It's a living. What are you going to do about it?
accept_34193_1=It's a long story. Are you patient enough to listen to it?
complete_34001=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Hello! How can I help you?</font>
complete_34002=I usually only accept students with a background in martial arts, but I will make an exception. Always listen to my words, and we'll soon find out what you're made of.
complete_34003=Remember, more practice is necessary in the future.  Ascend higher, you can look farther!
complete_34004=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Yes?</font>
complete_34004_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >She's not accepting any customers yet, I am afraid. She is quite shy.</font>
complete_34005=Boy, you're on this errand again.  Thanks a lot!
complete_34006=<s>I am sorry. We are not open.
complete_34007=<s>You? Why would you want to help me?
complete_34008=<s>Why hello, young one. I've been waiting for you.
complete_34009=Good. I will grant you my inner skills. Follow my lead.
complete_34010=<s>You're our reinforcements, eh?
complete_34011=<s>I saw what happened. We aren't going to get through those gates with pretty words.
complete_34012=<s>Punching Shen Canghai in the face felt wonderful.
complete_34013=<s>I see. Thank you for this information. In return, I will help you find this kidnapper of yours.
complete_34014=<s>You are still here? Get out!
complete_34015=<s>You look panicked. What happened?
complete_34016=<s>Come to gloat, have you?
complete_34016_1=<s>How dare you! Apologize! Now!
complete_34017=<s>These henchmen of Royal Guards. They still stay here, but stare at us secretly.
complete_34018=<s>Ah, hello! I always have time for any young warrior that slaps a little sense into Father. What can I do for you?
complete_34019=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Boy, you're here again. Send tea here, right?</font>
complete_34020=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Oh! You're that warrior that challenged the castle. You were amazing!</font>
complete_34021=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >(panting) Wang Xiao just stabbed me and ran down the hill.</font>
complete_34022=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >With me guarding the Golden Needle Sect, even a fly dares not enter this place.</font>
complete_34023=<s>Ahh. It already feels better. I will search the castle grounds for Xiuxiu. Don't let Wang Xiao escape!
complete_34024=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Give me a moment to grind the herb into paste.</font>
complete_34025=<s>I will hand over the wages I owe the tea farmers and will not do something this stupid again.
complete_34026=<s>Thank you for rescuing me.
complete_34027=<s>You tracked me down all the way here. Impressive.
complete_34028=<s>Argh... If I hadn't been hurt by that crazy old woman, you wouldn't have beaten me if there were ten of you!
complete_34029=<s>Help! Help! Is there anyone who can help me?!
complete_34030=<s>Ah. I will not act in this way again. Thank you for warning me.
complete_34031=<s>Thank you very much for your help this time.
complete_34032=<s>I have to tell you something. You're going to run into a great disaster.
complete_34033=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >W-what a beautiful floor. You are an artist with that broom! WHO IS GOING TO SWEEP FOR ME NOW?</font>
complete_34034=<s><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Be careful, and have a nice trip.</font>
complete_34035=
complete_34036=
complete_34037=
complete_34038=<s>It's not safe…you need to get out of here!
complete_34039=<s>Why do you make a fuss here? You've made a big trouble, do you know?
complete_34040=<s>I see you are finally back. What took so long?
complete_34041=<s>It's a shame we couldn't turn you into a winemaker.
complete_34042=<s>A willing recruit for our agency? Now this is something I don't see every day.
complete_34043=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I don't know what you did to anger the Shen Family, but it must have been bad.</font>
complete_34044=
complete_34045=<s>You're back here now. Do you have a nice trip?
complete_34046=
complete_34047=<s>Don't get sentimental now. Your fate was already written long before. Why can’t you just accept that?
complete_34048=<s>Much better, this will do nicely. Now, where were we?
complete_34049=<s>To lead the Sky Star Gang I'll need the official document from Xue Bao. Unfortunately the scum keeps it with him at all times.
complete_34050=<s>Excellent, this letter proves my rightful place as leader. You helped me, now I will help you by calling off the Sky Star Gang immediately.
complete_34051=<s>I think it's your turn to tell the truth now. Why are the Royal Guards after you?
complete_34052=<s>Ah! Take whatever you want! Please don't hurt me!
complete_34053=<s>You've got it! Why I haven't had the chance to make one of these in years.
complete_34054=<s>You! Where have you been?
complete_34055=<s><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Are you from the escort agency?</font>
complete_34056=<s>I wonder why you come here to visit us Rat Gate?
complete_34057=<s>Yes, have you found something?
complete_34058=<s>Thank you for helping me. If not for you I'd be dead!

complete_34066=I am fine, but my brothers are dead because of you!
complete_34067=
complete_34069=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >  Interesting. I think you just brewed a spirit strong enough to sedate an ox. Let me hold onto this, for safety’s sake.</font>
complete_34070=Where're you from? You dare to break into the Royal Guards. Tell me your name and I'll spare your life.
complete_34071=Huangfu Yao sent someone here? I know nothing about it. Also, you look like a total stranger.
complete_34072=I am to blame, I'm sorry.
complete_34073=Thank you for your help!
complete_34074=<s>Thank you for saving him! I will ask our leader to promote you.
complete_34078=Let me see what the letter says.
complete_34079=<s>Why have you come here?
complete_34080=<s>I'll make decision on my own. Any external interference isn't necessary.
complete_34081=You mean I must listen to what you say?
complete_34082=Don't argue. I will not listen to sweet words.
complete_34084=<s>We're protecting the Seven-Star Hall.
complete_34085=Flee! Or we're sure to die here!
complete_34086=You... You... still have the guts to come back. You bandit!
complete_34087=<s>I won't kill you for the time being, but I won't believe you.
complete_34088=Let me think... I am not sure if I can trust you.
complete_34089=Thank you. The Salt Gang is here and I'm talking with Ma Tian, the deputy leader of Salt Gang.
complete_34090=<s>You are still so arrogant, even when dying!
complete_34091=<s>I'll give whatever you want. Please let me go!
complete_34092=We punished those Royal Guards and the Salt Gang!
complete_34093=Well, your analysis is good enough. More guys from Salt Gang will come over here to make troubles.
complete_34094=I will not stop until I kill Ma Tian.
complete_34095=I believe you're innocent. The Seven-Star Pond will never forget your kindness.
complete_34096=<s>It's nothing but a rumor.
complete_34097=You're better than your Shifu. I must duel you again.
complete_34098=<s>You've finally arrived.
complete_34099=<s>Since I'm wandering in the world, it isn't strange at all to see me anywhere in the world.
complete_34100=Wait a moment! I'll prepare medicine with Red grass.
complete_34101=<s>But this pill may have side effects. If you always take it, it'll do more harm than good in the long run. Consquently, you will lose all your martial arts skills and become completely disabled.
complete_34102=<s>Take care during your travels.
complete_34103=Boy, I meet you here at last? Hand our young mistress over to us, OK?
complete_34104=I asked local people about it. They claimed that he walked along this road to Yanjing. I took measures to stop him, but didn't expect to meet you here.
complete_34105=You, you… Who are you? There is no young girl, only me, an old lady.
complete_34106=<s>Boy, I've noticed you following me. Don't want to die, right? Get away!

complete_34112=<s>The more food you bring me, the more I shall eat.
complete_34113=<s>Give me the money I need to get home.
complete_34114=It is that person, the thief that is an avaricious man. I even recognize him as he becomes ashes.
complete_34115=It's this item. Thanks for your help. You're my big hero.
complete_34116=<s>Nothing, unexpectedly the people of Five-immortal Sect and Devil Sect go after us here.
complete_34117=After she knew Five-immortal Sect would deal with us, she asked me to come to Yanjing and seek information, but I didn't expect they would arrive here ahead of me.
complete_34118=Thank you for your help.
complete_34119=How are you? My savior, hee-hee.
complete_34120=Thank you for saving my life.
complete_34121=Sorry, that's my son Zhuo Donglai. He is a little bit rude, please forget about him. He thought you belonged to the Royal Guards.
complete_34122=It's ok if our Weiyuan Escort Agency knows that you're not from Royal Guards, but we can do nothing about other schools. We can only be a persuasive talker for you.
complete_34123=<s>You have a strong sense of justice and are ready to protect the weak. I'd like to be your friend.
complete_34124=<s>Cough...cough...I was attacked secretly by the damned men of Five-immortal Sect.
complete_34125=Thank you, you saved my life.
complete_34126=I don't fear you. I wait here for you.
complete_34127=<s>They were poisoned during an ambush by our people. Now they're just lying there, waiting for death.
complete_34128=<s>Don't. I can't be saved.
complete_34129=<s>What? How is that possible? How is that possible?
complete_34130=<s>Is this the antidote? I'll die anyway, so let me try it!
complete_34131=<s>This should be started with the Headmasters of Nishang Palace and Five-immortal Sect.
complete_34132=I wonder how First Martial Brother gets along with the teaching.
complete_34132_1=En, that's good. You need practice more in future so that my good intention won't be wasted.
complete_34133=<s>Oh. It's you.
complete_34134=I didn't expect you would come back so soon. Well done. I haven't been wrong about you. Anyway, there's still a long way to go...
complete_34139=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What do YOU want?</font>
complete_34140=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >In the brothel down the street. You are truly going to help me?</font>

complete_34144=<s>Please! Don't hurt me any more!
complete_34193=<s>Now there are many disciples from Nishang Palace poisoned by Five-immortal Sect's poison. The Five-immortal Sect's unique antidote recept is very complex. It needs several treasured medicinal herbs to remove the poison completely.
context_34001=<s>Talk to your father.
context_34002=All the martial arts must be obtained through hard work? The personal command decides the success of any moves.
context_34003=You need to practice both external skills and internal skills if you want to be an expert.
context_34004=<s>The old man's daughter is being held captive in the Chengdu Brothel.
context_34005=Why is tea sent here so later? I've urged you for several times. Can you afford our business problem?
context_34006=<s>I am no longer satisfied with my life at my father's tea shop, but I don't want to abandon him either. He has asked me to help him with a difficult customer. Who knows? Maybe something interesting will happen.
context_34007=<s>Qin Wuyou's sister, Qin Xiuxiu, is being held captive by the Royal Guard Wang Xiao in Golden Needle Sect.
context_34008=<s>The shopkeeper Qin Wuyou told me that Ye Nanzhi and Situ Jing went to rescue his sister from Golden Needle Sect. I am going to their aid.

context_34010=Meet Situ Jing at West Gate of Golden Needle Sect.
context_34011=<s>The Golden Needle Sect shielded Wang Xiao and attacked Ye Nanzhi. At that moment, Ye Nanzhi was outnumbered by them and dared not break in. Though I am infuriated by them, I will try to solve this peacefully.

context_34080=Let's go meet the Seven-Star Pond's leader.
context_34081=I'll never believe that man. Ask my son or Zhou Huang from the Seven-Star Pond.
context_34082=I haven't yet made a decision. Two of my daughters are currently in Sigh City comforting the villagers there, who had been violated by some mountain thieves. Yes, they may just be women, but  they are the most capable and agile women in the Six-Star Pond.
context_34083=Ha!  You think I'll actually believe you? (A mob of people suddenly approaches!) Who's that?
context_34084=My boy has returned. Let's see if he has any news.
context_34086=The Seven-Star Pond has become part of the Royal Guards. Let's flee.
context_34090=Ma Tian is always talking at random to delay on purpose. I think it's a trick.
context_34091=We've caught you! You'll die here.
context_34092=It's hard. Say something else.
context_34093=What have the disciples of the Seven-Star Pond come for?
context_34094=Thank you very much.
context_34095=Ah, just what I want! The Seven-Star Pond shall always remain opposed to the Salt Gang and Royal Guards. However, I can't let Ma Tian off. Kill him, then  loot his body.  I can then announce to the whole martial arts world that we will never align ourselves with the Royal Guards.
context_34097=Don't you want to stay at Seven-Star Pond and fight the Salt Gang and Royal Guards?
context_34098=Have a nice trip!
context_34101=This banned medicine can effectively enhance your Energy a hundredfold. But you must restrict it to small doses, or risk suffering serious side-effects.  As the situation is urgent, however, take the medicine as soon as possible!
context_34103=Be careful, the Royal Guards are wicked and merciless.
context_34104=You kidnapped her! Give her back!
context_34105=My eldest daughter has never mastered the idea that deliveries should be made on time. She should have returned yesterday, and we cannot put this trip off any longer. If you run into her on your way to Yanjing, can you tell her that I am VERY irritated? Thank you.
context_34106=Tigers have been causing a lot of trouble in the mountains lately. One was sniffing at my door last night! This has gone far enough. There is a strange man nearby that lives AMONG the tigers peacefully. Please meet with him, and see if he can help us.
context_34107=You're asking for trouble. Candy or whip, you shall make a choice? The girl looks quite pretty. I've never seen such a pretty girl. I bet she's my woman.
context_34108=I know, it's because of this bundle. In fact, what they escort is not something true. Since the escorted goods are precious, I'm afraid of any possible problem. Leave the escorted goods inside the bundle? Give them to Hu Yongyi? I've got something to handle at first.
context_34109=These sacred Persian items are a tribute gift to the emperor himself! There is no time to arrange a full escort. Please be careful!
context_34110=Devil's Gate cultists have been spotted in Yanjing. Be careful!
context_34111=I'm extremely hungry. Or I may die of Nutrition.
context_34112=Thank you, but I'm still hungry!
context_34113=I'm so sorry! Please forgive me!
context_34114=I'm a Nishang Palace Disciple. I come to Yanjing on business under order of my elder martial sister. I didn't expect the Sachet with Money would be stolen by the Avaricious Man of Devil's Gate. I can do nothing without money.
context_34115=Can you grab the sachet?
context_34116=I can tell you're not a local. What are you doing in Yanjing?
context_34117=I must start with elder martial sister who asked me to come to Yanjing. Anyway, promise me not to tell others.
context_34118=Two people of Devil's Gate are hanging about in the Suburb of Yanjing. Can you help me kill them?
context_34119=Someone asked me to give you this Jade Plate to take into the Inn.
context_34120=This is my father, he wanted to meet you after hearing that you saved me.
context_34121=So you are the waiter everyone is talking about...
context_34122=A band of Royal Guards ambushed my son on his first escort mission, and stole all of his goods! He has never forgiven them.
context_34123=You are good at martial arts, why not stay in our escort agency?
context_34124=Say hello to Zhuo Shishi before you go!
context_34125=Go but come back quickly. Jin Zhuni of Five-Immortal Sect is near, and she may find me.
context_34126=She is the Dharmapala of Five-immortal Sect. She excels in martial arts, and is not a common person. Be careful when you meet her.
context_34127=You're smart, but it's too late.
context_34128=You really think I'll just hand it over?
context_34129=Cough...cough...it's useless...Don't strain your brain for nothing...This...is the unique medicine of Five-immortal Sect. No one has the Antidote except for their people. Common Five-immortal Sect Disciples don't have the Antidote. I only worry about my naive youngest martial sister Lan Qinge. Please go to see her.
context_34130=<s>Isn't there anything you can do to save her?
context_34131=I don't feel well, but they tell me I will live. Please visit me if you ever need the assistance of Nishang Palace in the future.
context_34132=Now, enter the martial arts school and duel with your Elder Brother. Do not fight him with your hands, or your mind. Fight with your heart, and you will defeat him.
context_34133=<s>Defeat Fan Ba.
context_34134=I have nothing more to teach you. Return to your master.
context_34139=<s>Deliver the tea to Yang Minyuan.
context_34140=<s>You can hear someone shouting for help outside the silk shop! Rescue them!
context_34141=This is my granddaughter's portrait. I've come here by inquiring about her with the portrait along the way. You can take it as a token.
context_34142=Rescue the old man's daughter from the second floor of the Chengdu Brothel.
context_34143=<s>Speak with Taishu Qiao again and discover who was behind the kidnapping of the old man's daughter.
context_34144=<s>I fought Fan Ba and took the money he earned from selling Yan Zhi to the Chengdu Brothel.
context_34193=It's a long story. Are you patient enough to listen to it?

menu_34050_1=I'll be back.
menu_34051_1=I'll just be going--wait, who was looking for me now?
menu_34052_1=Intentionally? No. But selling tea is more dangerous than you’d think.
menu_34053_1=My enemies won't stop chasing me until I'm dead.
menu_34054_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thank you. I’m sure this will be useful at some point.</font>

menu_34071_1=of course, here's the West Mountain Hunting Ground of Royal Guards. My knowledge can help do nothing.
menu_34072_1=How can I earn your trust?
menu_34073_1=Well, I'll go along with you. Take it easy.
menu_34074_1=Brother Hong, many thanks for your recommendation. I'll go and talk with the deputy leader Ma about what comes next.
menu_34075_1=Seven-Star Pond? The faction around Xiangyang Hill?
menu_34077_1=I'm just a messenger. Why do you do this?
menu_34078_1=I've got to hurry and chase them. Goodbye.
menu_34079_1=In that case, I must go over to look into it. In this way, we can avoid all the troubles.

menu_34086_1=I should ask the leader about it.
menu_34087_1=Well, our misunderstanding is so deep. I bet it must be a trick of Royal Guards.
menu_34088_1=Well......I must go now! For us, it's a great chance.
menu_34090_1=Don't worry! I'll go to ask him by myself.
menu_34091_1=We've expected your ambush. You mean we're afraid of it? Why not surrender now?
menu_34092_1=Then just be a good prisoner.  I have no time to keep you company.
menu_34093_1=Let's see what important notice the disciple has got.
menu_34094_1=I'm to go soon. But it's not a long-term plan.
menu_34095_1=Pond Leader, since you've made a decision, I'll do as you've told.
menu_34096_1=Me? For me, what you're talking about? Pond Leader, I hope you can tell me about it.

menu_34113_1=Well, I'll let go of you today. Next time, you're to die.
menu_34114_1=Why it's people from Devil's Gate again? They stop at no evil
menu_34115_1=That guy bullies people a lot. I'll catch him and punish him!
menu_34116_1=It's a long story. I helped foil the plot of the Royal Guards in Seven-Star Pond.
menu_34117_1=What on earth is that? So mysterious. Ok, I promise you.
menu_34118_1=I'll go right now. Those men are evil.
menu_34119_1=Jade plate? Inn? I don't know about this...
menu_34120_1=I want to visit Mr. Zhuo.
menu_34121_1=Well, how can it be? I've always kept a low profile.
menu_34122_1=I see, confidence is important to an escort.
menu_34123_1=Forgive that I can not comply with your orders since I must rush to handle many things.
menu_34124_1=En. I'm going to say goodbye to Miss Shishi.
menu_34125_1=I'll come back soon. Don't walk around. Don't be afraid, you can count on me.
menu_34126_1=Is she Jin Zhuni? She's fierce, be careful!
menu_34127_1=Damn it! I'll punish you after a while!
menu_34128_1=Don't blame me for being rude. I'll grab it.
menu_34129_1=I'll go now. I can't watch her die.
menu_34130_1=No one has the antidote but the Five-Immortal Sect.
menu_34131_1=Thank you. (What sound?  )
menu_34132_1=I'm about to compete with my elder brother.
menu_34133_1=Thank you. Now, get out of my town.
menu_34134_1=Thank you, elder brother. I'll leave now.
menu_34139_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Thank you!</font>
menu_34140_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff">No! I…wait a moment. I hear shouting outside.</font>
menu_34141_1=Don't worry, I will help you save your granddaughter.
menu_34142_1=You don't frighten me. Stand aside!
menu_34143_1=Then I will find them first.
menu_34144_1=I am going to show you how it feels to be helpless.
menu_34193_1=No problem, I'm also very curious too. I'll listen carefully.
