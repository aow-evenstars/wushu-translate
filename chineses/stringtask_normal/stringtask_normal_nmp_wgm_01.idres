
CanAcceptMenu_49501=Junior Eunuch, are you from the Imperial Court?
CanAcceptMenu_49502=Junior Eunuch, what can I do for you?
CanAcceptMenu_49503=Junior Eunuch, what can I do for you?
CanAcceptMenu_49504=Eunuch, what can I do for you?
CanAcceptMenu_49505=Please tell me what I can get for you.
CanAcceptMenu_49506=The man I am looking for must be your master, then. Where can I find him?
CanAcceptMenu_49507=What's the second task?
CanAcceptMenu_49508=What' next?
CanAcceptMenu_49509=Please tell me where to find Master Dongfang.
CanAcceptMenu_49510=Should we head out now?
CanAcceptMenu_49511=I am looking forward to meet Master Dongfang.
CanAcceptMenu_49512=Do you need me to get anything for you?
CanAcceptMenu_49513=Search for the Blood Kirin.
CanAcceptMenu_49514=I should look for the Blood Kirin in Suzhou.
CanAcceptMenu_49515=Please tell me what you know.
CanAcceptMenu_49516=I'm ready to track down Zhang Shicheng and his kin.
CanAcceptMenu_49517=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Is the Blood Jade Kirin a boon, or bane?</font>
CanAcceptMenu_49518=I've heard that the Rootless Clan members possess great power and long life. How is that so?
CanAcceptMenu_49520=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Accept task- </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Wei Wuyan, Lord of the Rootless Clan</font>
CanAcceptMenu_49521=Are there many rules I must follow?
CanAcceptMenu_49522=I will kill without mercy to warn others against making the same mistake.
CanAcceptMenu_49523=I now realize that, in order to go forward with the Rootless Clan, I must forget about the person I once was.
CanAcceptMenu_49524=I'm an eunuch now. I may as well live with this fact.
CanAcceptMenu_49525=I am ready to show my worth to the clan.
CanAcceptMenu_49526=I've won, but it was a close call.
CanAcceptMenu_49527=So, I am to prove my usefulness, after all.
CanAcceptMenu_49528=I've returned.
CanAcceptMenu_49529=What should we do next?
CanAcceptMenu_49530=So, even the dead stays with the clan.
CanAcceptMenu_49531=I am at your command.
CanAcceptMenu_49532=I am relieved to see that you are safe.
CanAcceptMenu_49533=The bandits are no longer a problem. What's next?
CanAcceptMenu_49534=I will look into this murder.
CanAcceptMenu_49535=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Is it right to attain strength at any cost?</font>
CanAcceptMenu_49540=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Master! </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Do you have any instructions for me?</font>
CanAcceptMenu_49541=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The situation in the East Chamber is uncertain. We don't have any dirt on them either. I don't know what to do.</font>
CanAcceptMenu_49542=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Master, if we continue to use the Imperial steel...</font>
CanAcceptMenu_49543=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What are you looking at?</font>
CanAcceptMenu_49547=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Master! Do you have any instructions for me?</font>

CanAcceptMenu_49563=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What should we do?</font>
CanAcceptMenu_49570=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Master Zhao, did you call me over?</font>
CanAcceptMenu_49651=I no longer wish to be in the Rootless Clan.
CanAcceptMenu_49652=I wish to leave the Rootless Clan.
CanAcceptMenu_49794=I will hunt down the fugitive.
CanAcceptMenu_49795=I will go on patrol.
CanAcceptMenu_49796=I will destroy the Beast Villa.
CanAcceptMenu_49797=I will destroy the Golden Needle Sect.

CanAcceptMenu_49801=I am here to help you collect materials.
CanAcceptMenu_49802=I am ready to seek our allies.

CompleteMenu_49502=Here comes the wine.
CompleteMenu_49503=I am at your service.
CompleteMenu_49504=I've defeated the guard.
CompleteMenu_49505=Greetings, Master Dongfang.
CompleteMenu_49506=Brother Dongfang, here's your wine.
CompleteMenu_49507=Here's all the food you wanted.
CompleteMenu_49508=The deed is done.
CompleteMenu_49509=About my request…
CompleteMenu_49510=Are you hurt?
CompleteMenu_49511=Are you Master Dongfang?
CompleteMenu_49512=I brought you the herbs. Will you help me now?
CompleteMenu_49513=I know where to look for the Blood Kirin.
CompleteMenu_49514=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I will give respect where respect is due. I am here for information.</font>
CompleteMenu_49515=I've done your dirty work.
CompleteMenu_49516=I've survived Twilight Village and returned with the treasure.
CompleteMenu_49517=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Do not mock me. I am ready to join you.</font>
CompleteMenu_49518=The Rootless Clan's door of misfortune
CompleteMenu_49519=So, this is the Rootless Clan.
CompleteMenu_49520=I am ready to meet our lord and master.

CompleteMenu_49523=I am no longer the person I once was.
CompleteMenu_49524=(He finally stops talking!) Thank you for all that you've said to me.
CompleteMenu_49525=The bold will take the crown in the test of battle
CompleteMenu_49526=Changhen remains as the wind blows without pity
CompleteMenu_49527=Do you have anything else you need to tell me?
CompleteMenu_49528=I follow your orders, but it only because I choose to do so.
CompleteMenu_49529=So, we've come this far. So many have died at our hands.
CompleteMenu_49530=I am here to learn, master.
CompleteMenu_49531=Well met, sir.
CompleteMenu_49532=Here is something you can use.
CompleteMenu_49533=He's dead.
CompleteMenu_49534=I've done as you asked.
CompleteMenu_49535=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >So, power is amoral. Right or wrong has nothing to do with it.</font>
CompleteMenu_49540=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Master! I have arranged everything</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >We'll wait for the show.</font>

CompleteMenu_49544=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Master! I have been around in the city for a while. I think this time the Zhe Gang is finished.</font>
CompleteMenu_49545=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Part of the Imperial steel is in our hands.</font>
CompleteMenu_49546=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Master, I have taken care of it.</font>

CompleteMenu_49561=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Job's done.</font>
CompleteMenu_49562=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Something bad has happened. All the carrier pigeons are dead.</font>
CompleteMenu_49563=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Elder Brother Feng, something bad has happened.</font>
CompleteMenu_49564=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >What should we do?</font>
CompleteMenu_49651=I hereby renounce the Rootless Clan!
CompleteMenu_49652=I am leaving the Rootless Clan.
CompleteMenu_49795=I've completed the patrol.
CompleteMenu_49796=I have destroyed the Beast Villa.
CompleteMenu_49797=I have destroyed the Golden Needle Sect.
CompleteMenu_49799=I have castrated a potential recruit.
CompleteMenu_49800=I've collected the materials you asked for.
CompleteMenu_49801=I've collected the materials you asked for.
CompleteMenu_49802=I have done as you asked.
CompleteMenu_49803=I have done as you asked.
CompleteMenu_49804=I have done as you asked.
CompleteMenu_49805=Job's done.
CompleteMenu_49806=It's done.
CompleteMenu_49807=Job's done.
CompleteMenu_49808=It's done.
CompleteMenu_49809=Job's done.
CompleteMenu_49810=It's done.
CompleteMenu_49811=Job's done.
CompleteMenu_49812=It's done.
CompleteMenu_49813=Job's done.
CompleteMenu_49814=It's done.
CompleteMenu_49815=Job's done.
CompleteMenu_49816=It's done.
CompleteMenu_49817=Job's done.
CompleteMenu_49818=It's done.
CompleteMenu_49819=I have interrogated the prisoner.
CompleteMenu_49821=I have carried out the interrogation.
CompleteMenu_49822=I have summoned our disciples.
accept_49501_1=What do you want?
accept_49502_1=Save your flattery. You must want something.
accept_49503_1=You must have seen Master Diao's fine clothing and assumed that he is someone important in the Imperial Court. You want to get something from him. Am I right?
accept_49504_1=I heard from Little Mo that you are very clever and dependable. I have something you can do for me. Don't worry, I will reward you well.
accept_49505_1=It's rumored that this treasure was last spotted in the Yanjing area. But I haven't been able to get any updates even after countless inquiries.
accept_49506_1=I do know the Master Dongfang you mentioned. Master Dongfang would die of exhaustion if I told him every time someone asked me about him.
accept_49507_1=Take it easy. Look, we've got good wine. How could we not have good food?
accept_49508_1=This last matter will depend on your skill.
accept_49509_1=The Master Dongfang you are seeking is my Master. Since you appear to be very sincere, I will take you over. But I have to go to Yanjing City to buy some things for my Master. Why don't you find a place to rest, and look for me in the valley in the West Mountain in a few hours?
accept_49510_1=You came at just the right time. There was a group of people following me earlier. They must be ruffians who are bent on revenge!
accept_49511_1=Our Master is in that small courtyard in the valley by the West Mountain. Since it's still early, I'll go wander a bit before heading back.
accept_49512_1=So, it's that fellow. Based on what he's like, it must have taken you a lot of effort to get my location from him. Ah, never mind. I know you have come here to ask for a favor. Why don't you help me, and I'll help you too.
accept_49513_1=Blood Kirin! This happened a long time ago. But it doesn't hurt to tell you.
accept_49514_1=Jiangnan? Who's there?
accept_49515_1=Somebody named Zhang at Tai Lake? Are you looking for the descendants of Zhang Shicheng?
accept_49516_1=There is a small fishing village above Tai Lake, which is rumored to be the place where Zhang Shicheng's descendants live. The residents in that small fishing village don't have a lot of contact with outsiders, and their comings and goings are very secretive.
accept_49517_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Many people are now eyeing this thing again. Deliver it to the Eunuch immediately to avoid any trouble.</font>
accept_49518_1=Hehe, If you plan on becoming one of us, you will know it soon enough.
accept_49520_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >{@0:Name}, you have joined the Rootless Clan, which means that you are a disciple of his highness, Lord Wei. The reason why the Rootless Clan has no rival both in the Court and Jianghu is because of our lord's excellent leadership. Remember to be respectful when you meet him. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Get yourself ready and then report to me. You may enter the Palace after I send word.</font>
accept_49521_1=Our faction has only three rules, but you must remember them. Rule 1: You shall not fight any other disciples of our faction. Rule 2: You shall follow orders. Rule 3: You shall not expose your identity. The penalty for not remembering these rules is a painful death.
accept_49522_1=Our School is very clear about its punishments and rewards. It's not just punishment you can expect when you make a mistake: death is swift and certain. Go to the jail and find Duan Hai. Take a look at how our clan punishes disciples who make mistakes.
accept_49523_1=You will face great challenges when carrying out your tasks. What you must do is to overcome your weaknesses and flaws so that your emotions don't hold you back. Otherwise, you won't be able to bear the consequences. Losing your head is no laughing matter!
accept_49524_1=Young man, the Rootless Clan's rules might be few in number, but breaking any one of them means death. You should know this already. I have seen many disciples lose their lives over the years. Don't complain about my nagging. I am just reminding you. You'll have nothing once you are dead.
accept_49525_1={@0:Name}, you have come at just the right time. I'm delivering the Lord's orders now. All new disciples are to make their way to the arena for the test. Don't be late!
accept_49526_1=Haha, a close win is still a win. We of the Rootless Clan have always focused on the ends, not the means. Achieving our goals by any means necessary is how we've always done things around here.  Being the victor, you have earned the right to carry out a very important task. Go see Feng Changhen, and he'll tell you what to do.
accept_49527_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >I'll get to the point. Your first task is to go to Moke Island and bring back someone's head. This is a great gift prepared for our collaborators. This person as well as our collaborators used to be Zhang Shicheng's subordinates. With this gift, I think the success rate for our transactions will be greater. </font>
accept_49528_1=I'll take care of the next task. Look, I have finished my wine. Why don't you go fetch me some more? Then come find me uphill.
accept_49529_1=I think those bandits have already made it to the meeting place we agreed on. Go on, it's up that hill. I'll meet up with you after I clear our tracks in the valley. Just play it by ear until I come.
accept_49530_1=You can go now. I'll report the details of this task to the clan. Since you did well, I think you will be able to take on harder tasks. Go back to the Rootless Clan and report to Zhao Wuji. Just tell him what happened.
accept_49531_1={@0:Name}, you have made significant progress. Now our Lord orders you to go to Suzhou now and meet up with Feng Changhen. He will give you the details. Carry out the order!
accept_49532_1={@0:Name}, thanks to you, disaster has been averted. You are my savior.
accept_49533_1={@0:Name}, I've troubled you long enough. I can move now, and I don't think those bandits will come after me anymore. I have some business I must attend to right now, but tomorrow, I want to treat you at the Songhe Tavern in Suzhou. Would you do me this honor, brother?
accept_49534_1=You must inform me of your investigation. I want help you avenge your brother.
accept_49535_1=The basic rule of Jianghu is this: there is neither right nor wrong. The one with the greatest power determines what's right. Take, say, our emperor. Who dares to tell him to his face that what he says is wrong?
accept_49536_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >accept_49536_1</font>
accept_49540_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The case of the stolen imperial steel is not yet closed. We must make good use of this opportunity. Go to the Jinling Skyward Palace right now. Someone there will come to your aid.</font>
accept_49541_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Do we have any dirt on the Huaixi Gang?</font>
accept_49542_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Idiot! Do you think the same tactic will work all the time?! I have a list here. We shall improvise!</font>
accept_49543_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Is this how you ask somebody for help?</font>
accept_49547_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The case of the stolen imperial steel is not yet closed. We must make good use of this opportunity. Go to the Jinling Skyward Palace right now. Someone there will come to your aid.</font>
accept_49550_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >That's right! I have a task for you. Go to Jinling to meet with Feng Changhen. He'll tell you all the details.</font>
accept_49553_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Disguise yourself as a Royal Guards disciple, and hide the imperial steel in the treasure vault. Zhu Gaoxu's spy will try to find evidence.</font>
accept_49554_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Find something for the seven Schools to do. You take care of the Beggar's Sect!</font>
accept_49555_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Release the main force and kill the officers. Move it! Spare no lives!</font>
accept_49560_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >That's right. Same deal. Go to Jinling to see Feng Changhen.</font>
accept_49561_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Zhu Gaosui is at the Jinling Academy. Give him the opportunity to attack the Royal Guards.</font>
accept_49562_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Ah, so you have. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Go back to report to Zhao Wuji. I have other things to do.</font>
accept_49563_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Only you and Feng Changhen will go and inform the junior disciples in each stronghold. Go to the Imperial Horse Ranch, Qixia Temple, Temple of Gratitude, Wang Cattle Farm, and </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Imperial Hunting Ground </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >in Jinling. And inform the liaison personnel there.</font>
accept_49570_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You'll </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >get to </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >know some of the clan's secrets later. You do care for your life, don't you? </font>
accept_49572_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Find that traitor. Go!</font>
accept_49575_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Feng Changhen…well done, you sly devil.</font>
accept_49651_1=Hmph, Rootless Clan isn't a place where you can just come and go as you please.
accept_49652_1=You have been with the Rootless Clan for a while. Although we are not as strong as before, we are still a power to be reckoned with. If you leave, your fate is in your hands.
accept_49794_1=Our spy has reported that the escaped traitor is heading toward Suzhou through Jinling. Go and bring him back right now.
accept_49795_1=Although the Rootless Clan is located in a secluded location, there are no walls that wind can't get through. Go on patrol near the jail, that's where trouble is most likely to happen.
accept_49796_1=The Beast Villa dare to look down on the Rootless Clan. That's no way we can allow them to exist.
accept_49797_1=The Golden Needle Sect dares to look down on the Rootless Clan. That's no way we can allow them to exist.
accept_49798_1=The Xu Family Manor dares to look down on the Rootless Clan. That's no way we can allow them to exist.
accept_49799_1=Find a potential recruit, and castrate him. (You will enter the action mode when you accept the task. You will give up the task if you click on the exit button in the castration action interface or find Zhang Jielun of the Rootless Clan (22,225).)
accept_49800_1=I will reward you once you complete your task.
accept_49801_1=Oh, good. It has been busy around here lately. We don't have enough people, so go get something for me.
accept_49802_1=There is strength in unity, and here at the Rootless Clan, strength is everything.
accept_49803_1=Prove your worth and sincerity to me, by completing my task.
accept_49805_1=The wind will destroy any trees that stand out from the forest. As the Rootless Clan becomes stronger as whole, its individual members have become more vulnerable.
accept_49806_1=They attacked me by surprise. I will kill those bastards when I recover from my injuries.
accept_49807_1=The wind will destroy any trees that stand out from the forest. As the Rootless Clan becomes stronger as whole, its individual members have become more vulnerable.
accept_49808_1=They attacked me by surprise. I will kill those bastards when I recover from my injuries.
accept_49809_1=The wind will destroy any trees that stand out from the forest. As the Rootless Clan becomes stronger as whole, its individual members have become more vulnerable.

accept_49811_1=The wind will destroy any trees that stand out from the forest. As the Rootless Clan becomes stronger as whole, its individual members have become more vulnerable.
accept_49812_1=They attacked me by surprise. I will kill those bastards when I recover from my injuries.
accept_49813_1=The wind will destroy any trees that stand out from the forest. As the Rootless Clan becomes stronger as whole, its individual members have become more vulnerable.
accept_49814_1=They attacked me by surprise. I will kill those bastards when I recover from my injuries.
accept_49815_1=The wind will destroy any trees that stand out from the forest. As the Rootless Clan becomes stronger as whole, its individual members have become more vulnerable.
accept_49816_1=They attacked me by surprise. I will kill those bastards when I recover from my injuries.
accept_49817_1=The wind will destroy any trees that stand out from the forest. As the Rootless Clan becomes stronger as whole, its individual members have become more vulnerable.
accept_49818_1=They attacked me by surprise. I will kill those bastards when I recover from my injuries.
accept_49819_1=Strength is power, and power is control. You will bend these prisoners to your will.
accept_49822_1=Battle is at hand! Summon our disciples!
complete_49501=More than meets the eye, you say? Then show me. I won't pay you if don't give me a good reading.
complete_49502=You are very clever in doing things. Go ahead and speak up.
complete_49503=So, you're here with Little Mo's recommendation. I am an easy-going person, but I'd like to see what you can do first.
complete_49504=I didn't expect that you would be this skillful at such a young age. I have confidence in you now. I won't mistreat you as long as you are working for me.
complete_49505=Dongfang is indeed my last name, but I don't deserve the title of Master.
complete_49506=It's indeed wine made from grapes. Excellent. Let me toast you.
complete_49507=Ha-ha, Beggar's Chicken, Salted duck and Dongpo Pork. They are all my favorite dishes. You did well. I'll take you to see Master Dongfang once you complete the final task for me.
complete_49508=Very good. Since you helped me so much, I'll take you to see Master Dongfang.
complete_49509=I, Dongfang Lin, always return a favor. Since you helped me so much, I will certainly take you to see my Master.
complete_49510=I'm fine. My master has been living as a recluse on West Mountain, and doesn't like to see outsiders.
complete_49511=I have been living as a recluse in the valley for many years. How did you find this place?
complete_49512=I have already said yes. Go ahead and speak up if you think you must. I won't bother telling you lies!
complete_49513=Haha, good boy! We didn't misjudge you. Where is the Blood Kirin now?
complete_49514=Information? You have come to the right person. There's nothing I don't know about around here. It depends on whether you can afford the price.
complete_49515=I wanted to check your kung fu skills. The place you are going is very treacherous. I saw a team of the Royal Guards heading toward there. You must be careful.
complete_49516=Uh, that's right. This is it. You will be rewarded for this.
complete_49517=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Now this is something we don't see often. Very few live to stand where are now, and fewer still leave with their lives.</font>
complete_49518=Ha-ha...Think about it carefully. You either join our Rootless Clan, or you can die.
complete_49519=Since you are now in the Rootless Clan, you must turn away from your past, and follow the Clan rules without question. Otherwise, you'll die a painful death.
complete_49520=All in good time, kid. Know this: although we of the Rootless Clan have few rules, breaking any of them can be fatal. You'd better not get yourself killed. I collect many corpses every day.
complete_49521=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Hmm, you are indeed a Rootless Clan disciple. Smooth and clean. Excellent. Do your duty from now on, and you'll be rewarded.</font>
complete_49522=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >You are an official Rootless Clan disciple from today on. </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Go </font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >to the entrance and report to Deacon Zhao Wuji. </font>
complete_49523=No, no, I didn't look. Anyway, it does me no good to look. It only makes me sad.
complete_49524=Hmm. It's right to be careful. Although we of the Rootless Clan are not as powerful as the eight schools, we are nothing to look down upon. Our internal skills such as the Deviant Vampire and Unholy Swordsmanship are unmatched. Whoever dares to go against the Rootless Clan will be killed, no matter how far the distance.
complete_49525={@0:Name}, I didn't expect that you as a newcomer would have such strength.
complete_49526=The only thing I can advise you is to survive. Every Rootless Clan disciple sharpens his skills through countless dangerous tasks. The weak will be eliminated.
complete_49527=I know you have questions, but it's better not to know things that you are not supposed to know. The less you know, the better.
complete_49528=Yes. You have to hold your fate in your hand, and not hand it over to others. Otherwise, it will be too late when you find out before you die. Leave a path of retreat for yourself and you'll live longer than others.
complete_49529=Young man. Do you smell the blood in the air? This is just the beginning. The road ahead of you will be paved with blood.  We have only one goal, and that's to complete the task, regardless of the price. I hope you can understand that when facing an enemy, either you or he dies. Think about it.
complete_49530=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Based on the rules, you have earned the right to study the Deviant Vampire. You may go to your instructor. The Unholy Swordsmanship is our faction's signature technique. The secret of this skill is that he who is fast will not be broken. I am not going to say more. You will understand after you study it. </font>
complete_49531=Brother, your kung fu is outstanding. If I weren't so careless, I wouldn't have been at the mercy of those bandits. My name is Yan Lingyun. How should I address you?
complete_49532={@0:Name}, this herb of yours is remarkable. I feel better now.
complete_49533={@0:Name}, this is most strange. Who killed him?
complete_49534=What's done is done. Only by doing so, can you grow and strengthen your mind. Only the strongest will survive.
