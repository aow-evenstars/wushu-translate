complete_2805=<s>My people are everywhere. No matter how strong Zhang Jiwu is, you can't escape.
complete_2807=<s>{@0:}, your hesitation makes Tongling disappointed. You must be heartless and cruel. If you are too merciful, the General won't give you important missions.
complete_2808=<s>The three bandits went to The Purgatory (Forbidden Area). There is a way to heaven but they didn't go; there is no way to hell but he was forced to go.
complete_2811=<s>It leaves me out of account that he is Ding Xiaoshan. I've met him at Wild Goose Gate Pass. He is not a evildoer like the General says.
complete_2812=<s>It's all the Chief's plot. I hear East Chamber is expanding its force. We believed the calumny and nearly made big mistake.
complete_2814=<s>Kill all the people who violate the Imperial Edict and defy the order.

accept_4502_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Great Hero, hurry up, rescue East Spring Village! I do not know where these Tartar soldiers came from. They burned and looted in the village, and I risked my life to rush out to beg Yanmen Pass to rescue the villagers. However, I was refused, and even I was regarded as a spy. You seem to be uncommon heroes, please!</font> <font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Please rescue the villagers</font><font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >!</font>
accept_4523_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >According to General Fang's words, there are two Ming Soldier Garrisons outside the Yanmen Pass, one of which is General Hill, and another is Dark Shadow Cave. There is a lot of gunpowder in Dark Shadow Cave, and the enemy can use it to attack our camp from the side via Dark Shadow Cave. So I let General Fang lead you to Dark Shadow Cave now to assist A Lutai to capture Dark Shadow Cave quickly!</font>
accept_4524_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Haha, now It is difficult for Xu Haibing to achieve anything without support. His several senior generals are dead or captured. Now Yanmen Pass is a desperate city and we need not consider it any longer! So, today is the time to break through Yanmen Pass! You can take a break here to wait for orders, and I will go to discuss with the Marshal the details of breaking through the Pass along with the battle arrangements. Then we will gather in the Vanguard Camp to take a bloodbath to Yanmen Pass!</font>
accept_4525_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Haha... good, if you desire to go for shelter, I will consider you my brothers. As long as I live today day, I must let you</font> <font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >follow me</font> <font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >to eat and drink comfortably!</font>
accept_4526_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >A few days ago, you captured Dark Shadow Cave. But just in case, we need to capture Dark Shadow Cave to prevent them attacking our back when our main forces attack the city.</font>

You can carry soldiers to destroy this village, and the property plundered can be regarded as your pay. If you can capture the person called Fang Wuhen, you can use him to find the Advisor Liu Fangshuo who is in the camp. You can receive a generous reward!</font>
accept_4553_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >To tell you the truth, Tartar forces recently tried to attack Yanmen Pass, so the Lord ordered the whole Pass to be on alert. More than that, the Lord also made an appeal to recruit honorable people in the world to assist us. In my eyes, you're not ordinary, brother. Can you help Yanmen Pass?</font>
accept_4554_1=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Are you kidding me? How can I believe you!　 Look at my eyes! Tell me your real purpose!  </font>
complete_4502=All heroes, I am here on behalf of all the villagers to thank you! Without you, we are all… Alas, but some people failed to wait for your coming…
complete_4503=
complete_4504=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Here is Dark Shadow Cave, full of miasma and poisonous gas. You should be very careful!</font>
complete_4505=Thanks for your help, all Swordsmen. Otherwise, Yanmen Pass would be in danger.
complete_4506=How can it be so? Fang Wuhen actually surrendered. I was careless and believed him blindly, so he had the chance to approach the Lord. The city fell into the enemies' hands, and the Lord is likely dead. The morale in the city is very low. Although I put down my life, I lost the Pass. Even if I was cut into pieces, I cannot atone for my crime...
complete_4507=Everything is over. Yanmen Pass has experienced another test. Prince Zhu died for the country and it is a worthy death. Alas, it is an isolated city. It went through hundreds of years and suffered a lot, but at last there are only bones of the dead. Extending territory and fighting for hegemony; are such things worthy? You all take rescuing Yanmen Pass as a just act, but in the end you cannot claim credit for yourselves because of the Lord's death. Please accept my consolation. I have reported the crime of losing Lord in my arms, and I am waiting for judgement in Yanmen Pass. You can leave at ease. Green mountain will not change, and the water will flow forever. Let's depart here.
complete_4511=Alas, I hope so. We really shouldn't let this child run away. He is so happy that he does not know enough to come back!
complete_4512=It is all my fault! I got confused. I should die. But you had to lose your lives with me, and in the end I got General Fang into trouble. Although General Fang's title is not the highest, he was very important in Yanmen Pass. With him guarding, Yanmen Pass will not be lost! It is me! General Fang died with everlasting regret. The territory of the Ming Dynasty was captured by the Tartars and hundreds of years of residences were destroyed. I will not be forgiven even if I die!
complete_4513=Thanks! Hum, I will kill these Barbarians!
complete_4514=Cui'er! I am sorry, and I let you suffer! Good girl, do not be afraid. Everything will be over soon, hold on!
complete_4515=Haha, unexpectedly, I can see such a divine weapon before I die, my whole life is valuable because of this! As long as such a thing can be made, even if it is a Tartar, even Devils can be frightened and killed!
complete_4516=Great! Nowadays everything is ready, and we only need to wait for the Cannon be completed! Soon we can use this Mysterious Cannon to attack those the Tartars! Yanmen Pass, you must stay alive till that moment!
complete_4517=Young Hero, I am just a common person and cannot think like you do. If you really want to go through the pass. I have the passport. You can enter Yanmen Pass with it easily.
complete_4521=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Haha! The Ming Dynasty is dying! We just caught Yanmen Pass General Fang Wuhen. Now you join us, increasing the power of our army. If you follow our commander to build up your success, all of you may win untold riches!</font>
complete_4522=Haha! You have made a great contribution! With the assistance of General Fang, Yanmen Pass, even the whole Central Plain will be occupied! I, Yang Fangshuo will win honor and recognition!
complete_4523=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Haha! You have done a good job. I will record it.</font>
complete_4524=Haha! Nobody can defeat us in the whole world. Yanmen Pass is just the first step for us to fight for hegemony. Zhu Di, we will kill you! You have done a good job. This box of treasure is your reward!
complete_4525=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Haha! Welcome! Follow me. I will give you a rich life!</font>
complete_4526=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Haha. Well done.</font> <font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >If we can occupy Yanmen Pass this time, you will get the best rewards.</font>
complete_4527=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Hum. Good. You have done a good job. I am very satisfied.</font>
complete_4528=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Follow the Commander. The rich life is not far away!</font>
complete_4530=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Good! You are the honor of Great Ming!</font>
complete_4541=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >(Team Task)</font> <font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >So, let's start!</font>
complete_4542=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Good! I will report to the Court to promote you.</font>
complete_4543=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >The Tartars are utterly routed. We have won!</font>
complete_4552=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Good. You know how to fight in the cavalry!</font>
complete_4553=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Do not worry. I have a token. You may take this to enter the pass where there will be a person to arrange everything for you. When the Tartars come, the Lord will arrange the rest.</font>
complete_4554=<font face="Default" color="#ffffff" >Why are there so many Central Plains people join the foreign race?!  I have killed some of them and got some secret letters. Go to Yanmen Pass with this secret letter. Lu Zhong will believe in you.  I will contact you there.  </font>
context_4502=Great Hero, that group of foreigners has done many evil things in the village. Many villagers are dead or injured. If this continues, our village will be destroyed.
context_4503=<s>General Fang has fantastic martial arts skills. He would not have been caught but for us. After he was brought into the camps of the Tartars, he suffered terrible punishment and almost died, but he has not given up. Heroes, General Fang is a real man and a talented commander. If he guides in Yanmen Pass, it will be safe. Save General Fang as soon as possible.
context_4504=<s>the Tartars in the camp has found something. We cannot stay any longer. But if we go back the way we came, we must encounter them. And we have less people, so we should leave in the opposite direction. Follow me to go across the yellow plains. Go back to the pass crossing Huyang Hill and Dark Shadow Cave.
context_4505=<s>This is a secret letter written by Tartar Advisor Liu Fangshuo to the Tartar Emperor's teacher. It says that Fang Wuhen has surrendered and asked Wanyan Lasuo to help. Bull! General Fang is a hero and will never surrender. According to the letter, the Emperor's teacher is collecting Explosive in Dark Shadow Cave and going to send Braves to bomb the gate when they attack the city. We cannot let the teacher and his plan leave Dark Shadow Cave.
context_4506=<s>Good. That is the Clarion of the Tartar's attack. They have finally launched an attack on Yanmen Pass. Swordsmen, please follow me to fight against the enemies. We should guard Yanmen Pass and keep our civilians safe. As long as I am alive, I will not let any Tartar enter Yanmen Pass!
context_4507=<s>You are great people who think of your country and people. Please let me bow to you! All the people of Yanmen Pass would die if they lose their Lord. So why not fight to the death, to win or die? If we eliminate the Tartars, we may be excused. Even if I am punished, I will die without anything to regret. Now you are willing to save the Lord, and that has mitigated part of our troubles. A path outside Yanmen Pass leads to General Hill. Under the cliff there is the Base Camp of the Tartars. It is very dark tonight. You can fall into the Base Camp from the mountain top to rescue the Lord. You can set fire to the Base Camp set the camp in chaos after saving him. It will be best to burn the Tartars' supplies. We will use fire as the signal of attack and attract the Tartars' attention and thus escape. If you cannot save the Lord, Yanmen Pass will sooner or later be occupied. We will fight until we die. It is dangerous to save a person, with many contingencies. But we have to do this because we are the citizens of the Great Ming. Heroes, the security of Yanmen Pass, even the whole country is depending on this war. We should do our best to fight!
context_4511=<s>The day before yesterday, my daughter went to sell goods with a group of villagers, but she has not come back. I went all the way to Urn City but did not find my daughter. This is an age of war. What happened to her? I had said that it was dangerous outside. However, she didn't listen to me and decided to go out.
context_4512=<s>Shut up! You are all timid! We can never hand over the Snake-proof Fragrance. We are the people of the Great Ming. We should die for the country. How can we beg the Tartars for a living? Besides, we cannot beg for mercy. East Spring Village is our hometown. It may be destroyed by others. We should protect East Spring Village. East Spring Village should not be ruined due to our negligence!
context_4513=<s>the Tartars are not idiots. Now they have the advantage and will not listen to us. We are in trouble because of a small mistake. I am afraid that we cannot help General Fang. We have no way but to sacrifice my life. What you said is a good idea, but I have other arrangements. They want Snake-proof Fragrance, so we give it to them. You go to Snake Valley to catch some little snakes. I need their gall bladders. Remember, just little ones.
context_4514=<s>Snake gall is necessary for making Snake-proof Fragrance. It should be made of gall bladders from mature snakes and herbs to keep the aroma. But I will use the gall of little snakes. It can dispel the poisonous air in Snake Valley, but after a while the effect will disappear and the snakes will come out. However, the Tartars will have walked deep into the valley and will not escape. But some the Tartars are cautious. They may ask us to lead them. But I am not afraid of death. Please...
context_4515=<s>We successfully guarded the village. But many people died. The Yanmen War is continuing. The failure in Snake Valley cannot stop their attack. Once the pass is broken through, many people will lose their homes just like us. We should do something. My family was a famous craftsman family. We were enrolled into the war because of wealth. To avoid the chaos of the Central Plain, my family moved to the frontier. But everywhere sees war. We have no place to hide. And I finally understand that we cannot live well without a peaceful country. I still keep the drawing of the Mysterious Cannon passed down from my ancestors. You can take it to Yanmen Pass and ask craftsmen to make one. It will hurt the Tartars greatly. Kill more the Tartars for Xiaocui and other dead fellows.
context_4516=The Mysterious Cannon's structure is very exquisite and its style is unique, we should admire it. If there are some cannons like that in Yanmen Pass, we can defeat the Tartars easily! But there is not enough stone and wood in Yanmen Pass. The construction period may be too long. Please go to the back of the mountain to collect some materials. I will supervise the craftsmen while they make cannons.
context_4517=<s>I was a villager of East Spring Village outside Yanmen Pass. But obviously, the Tartars want to attack the pass and have thus set up camps outside the pass. I didn't want to leave my village but the war has become wider and will influence East Spring Village one day. So for the security of my family, I leave here and find a safe place to live. When the war ends, we will go back.
context_4521=<s>Haha. The Ming Dynasty is dying! We just caught Yanmen Pass Commander Fang Wuhen. Now if you join us, you will increase the power of our army. If you follow our commander to build our success, you will win riches!
context_4522=Fang Wuhen, whom we caught in East Spring Village days ago, is imprisoned in the Tartar back camp. His martial arts are excellent and he is a very prestigious person in the Garrison Army of Yanmen Pass. He has set both fake and real checkpoints and knows much about the disposition of forces. If he surrenders, it will be easy to attack Yanmen Pass. However, Fang Wuhen is very stubborn, tough-minded and determined, so he will not change his mind due to mere dreck. Fortunately, his family background is special and he holds irreconcilable hatred of Zhu Di. His name means “Hate-less,” but he may have hatred in his heart. You can start from this point and persuade him repeatedly by saying that Zhu Di exterminated Fang Xiaoru and his kindred that year. Only in this way can you persuade him.
context_4523=According to what General Fang says, there are two garrison stations of the Ming Army outside Yanmen Pass--one in General Hill and another in Dark Shadow Cave. Plenty of gunpowder is stored in Dark Shadow Cave, and they can go through Dark Shadow Cave to our back and attack our Base Camp. Therefore, I order General Fang to lead you to Dark Shadow Cave and help A Lutai capture Dark Shadow Cave.
context_4524=Ha-ha, Xu Haibing is now alone. Some of his Generals are dead, some surrendered, and Yanmen Pass is now an unsafe city. We do not have to worry. Today, we must be able to break Yanmen Pass! You can have a rest here and wait for my orders. I am going to discuss the attack details and disposition with the Marshal. Afterwards, we'll gather at the Vanguard Camp and slaughter Yanmen Pass!
context_4525=According to what Lu Zhong's subordinate says, going to Lu Zhong for shelter can get us plenty of money and extravagance. Therefore, go to the Snake Valley, find Lu Zhong and join his army as his mercenary.
context_4526=Though you have captured the Dark Shadow Cave a few days ago, the result of an unexpected accident, you now have to capture General Hill too. We cannot allow them to kill us, but we are unprepared in our attack.
context_4527=After joining Lu Zhong's Army, ask Lu Zhong for pay and provisions. Lu Zhong says that there is an East Spring Village not far from the Snake Valley. Let's rob this village and the treasures will be ours as our deserved pay.
context_4528=Ha ha, who on the earth still dares to fight with us? Yanmen Pass is only the first step of our plan to fight for hegemony. Zhu Di, wait and you will die soon! The one next to Yanmen Pass is Guanxia Village. The villagers are escaping with their treasures now. Let's go to kill them all!
context_4541=The Yanmen Pass Battle is urgent and critical. You arrive just in time!
context_4542=Brothers, thank you for your help! Thanks to you, the Tartar Army has been defeated and repelled.
context_4543=According to intelligence, a group of Wulin people sneaked into the Tartar Camp a few days ago and burned their provisions. The backup force of the Tartar Army hasn't come yet and their morale is sinking. We must take this opportunity and go out to fight back and repel the Tartar Army from Yanmen Pass.
context_4546=The Tartar Army occupied East Spring Village not long ago. General Fang Wuhen went to assist but no news returned and his life is uncertain. The Rebel Army of Lu Zhong's went to the Tartar Army for shelter. They took East Spring Village as a stronghold and now frequently invade the back of Yanmen Pass. We'll send troops to exterminate them and find news about General Fang.
context_4552=The battle in Yanmen Pass is very critical now. You have to master war skills quickly and go to help the frontline! New recruits can go to Hu Yingjie, Leader of cavalry, and join the prewar training to learn some necessary skills. He is on the drill ground in the inner city of Yanmen Pass.
context_4553=Recently, Tartar Army Yanmen Pass Station has been recruiting soldiers and plans to capture Yanmen Pass in one stroke. Though their intention is obvious, Yanmen Pass is ready for the battle. Prince Zhu, who garrisons the Yanmen Pass, has also released a call for men with honor from all walks of life to come together. Every man has a share in the fate of his country. Go to Yanmen Pass to protect the country.
context_4554=According to what Fang Pinting says, you need to take the Recommendation Letter and go to Yanmen Pass and join Lu Zheng's Rebel Army.

context_2177=<s>A few days ago, I heard that the Tartars made trouble outside Yanmen Pass. How is it now? I am really worried about it. Every man has a share in the fate of the country. Qingzhi came back from the Amber Plains just now. You can go to ask him about the situation of Yanmen Pass.
context_2178=<s>Yanmen Pass is known as the top pass of the world, which is easy to hold but hard to attack. If one man guards the pass, ten thousand are unable to get through. If Yanmen Pass is broken through, it means that the Tartar Army can open the gate and march into the Central Plains. Until that time, the people will be plunged into an abyss of misery and our country will be in a huge rut. But it is really worrying that the Imperial Court does not care about this at all. Now only one man can turn the tide, and it happens that this man is right in this temple. He used to be a Lord. Because he couldn't help himself out of some secular trifles, he became a monk to forget the old troubles. You can go to the Abbot House to find him.
context_2179=<s>Amitabha, good indeed. I have been a Buddhist, and none of the worldly events have a thing to do with me. Lord? No, I am just an ordinary Shaolin Monk now. If you really care about the common people, go down the mountain and beat those evil monks who bully the common people fiercely. After that, you can come back and talk to me about how to save the people in the world.
context_2182=<s>All these are evil. The past cannot be changed. It was because I was young and aggressive. I was blinded by hatred.
context_2185=<s>We have no time to lose. Let's divide ourselves into 2 groups. I will go back to Jinling first. You take my letter and go to Yanmen Pass then. I have sent a letter to my trusted follower Ding Yumin to ask her to wait for you outside the Pass. I have told her your story and she'll prepare some entry formalities for you. See you inside the Yanmen Pass.
context_4501=The Yanmen Pass has been besieged by the Tartar Army for days, but the backup troops of the Imperial Court haven't arrived yet. Every man has a share in the fate of the country. As a member of Jianghu, we cannot pay attention to our own morals without thought of others. We should go to Yanmen Pass and steadfastly safeguard the country, contribute our share of strength, repel the Tartars and protect our people, regardless of our own lives.

accept_2302_1=Many bandits have been looting and causing trouble recently. So much so that no one in the village can be at ease.

The patriarchs of the village would surely be appreciative.

context_2204=You have a gentle demeanor and you treat people fairly. I have seen how hard you have practiced over the years and no disciple makes me prouder. As you know, the most basic form of training for Shaolin is carrying water and chopping wood. Let me prepare a bigger water barrel for you to carry water in from now on. Your elder brother Qingkong has already carried his water out into the world somewhere.  Meet up with him and return here when you are done.
context_2212=<s>Young master, I don't understand. I heard that this lunatic is from Shaolin. If you want to know more, you should ask Master Abbot.
context_2213=I have already gone over the story of the mad monk with you. Enough with that.  Do you know why I needed you?
context_2214=Don't worry about it. Master Abbot figured it out. (Wondering): Elder Brother wants to learn martial arts skills so bad that he'll be in bad shape if he doesn't pass the test. I'll confess to the mistake and accept the punishment. It's better than Elder Brother receiving such a pitiful fate. I'll go to the Abbot and confess.
context_2215=The matter of the missing scriptures is closed. Do not worry about it any more. Go back and find your master. You must prepare for the test.
context_2217=(A few days later) Why hasn't your elder brother come back yet? I have looked all over for him with there's no trace. Maybe he went to the forbidden instance on the back hill? Why don't you head there and investigate. Though be forewarned, there is a lunatic imprisoned there. Whatever happens, do not try to handle that lunatic on your own.
context_2218=Because of your outstanding performance, you are among the first group of disciples to take the test this year. If you are ready, head to the forbidden instance on the back hill.
context_2228=<s>The grave robbers have been brazen of late. I never thought anyone would try to steal this from the Library... When you see Abbot Xuanhuai, give this to him. Never use it to learn martial arts without permission. Because you are not strong enough, you would not only fail to learn the skills but you would also become demonically possessed.
context_2307=Someone called "Green-Faced Beast" Teng Lei has trespassed upon Wudang ground. All disciples are to stop him.  {@0:}, your skills are noteworthy. Aid them in stopping Teng Lei.

context_2319=I never imagined that Xiang Jiuchen was a Wanderer's Valley disciple in disguise. We cannot let Wanderer's Valley succeed with their ploy. Defeat the Wanderer's Valley disciples!

context_2414=<s>You gave a lot of detail. This reminds me of something that happened two years ago. Could this be the same person?
context_2415=<s>(Sigh) I would have let you pass earlier but I am the only one who knows about Sifei's past. There's no need to search elsewhere. Even if you find out the truth, what good will it do? Well, seeing that you are so determined, I have cannot stop you. There is a box in the Meiyan Tower. If you can obtain the jade disc from the treasure box I will tell you everything!

context_2704=It's a good thing elder brother came to save you. Thank your elder brother.
context_2705=Younger brother, the poison in you is very strange. I have heard that the Six Jiangnan Elders of Guili Villa have unique healing skills. The Villa Lord has too. Perhaps if you find them they could cure you. Speak to the leader about going.

context_2811=According to Wang Dagui, Yue Zhipeng had escaped to deep inside the Underground Jail. Pursue him.
context_2812=Look at these two. They are definitely not conspirators or rebels. There is something fishy going on here. Continue the pursuit and find out the truth.

Since you got this Yinyang herb for me, I, Shan Chong, will tell you a this: Of the four Blissful Altarmen, only the Corpse Alterman was used by Shan Wuliang.
