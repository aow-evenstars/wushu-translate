
CanAcceptMenu_34578=Brother Ye, why do you frown?
CanAcceptMenu_34579=I'd like to know something about Nine Yin Manual.
CanAcceptMenu_34580=I'd like to ask you one more thing. Do you know my parentage?
CanAcceptMenu_34581=What should I do now, Leader?
CanAcceptMenu_34582=Aunt, what do you know? I can't search randomly. This isn't the way.
CanAcceptMenu_34583=Now you can rest assured.
CanAcceptMenu_34584=I won't forget your kindness, Leader.
CanAcceptMenu_34585=Why you are here?
CanAcceptMenu_34586=I'll go to find some Herbal Medicines for you. This is Losing heart Disease.
CanAcceptMenu_34587=So you're ok now.
CanAcceptMenu_34588=The Alliance Leader Lin told me that you're familiar with Nine Yin Manual, so I've come to consult you.
CanAcceptMenu_34589=Girl, what can you do?
CanAcceptMenu_34590=Ok, I'll go to say goodbye to Island owner now.
CanAcceptMenu_34591=Please let me leave, Sir.
CanAcceptMenu_34592=You come to help me?
CanAcceptMenu_34593=Li Hanqiu, can you help me?
CanAcceptMenu_34594=How do you help me leave Peachblossom Island?
CanAcceptMenu_34595=Leader Lin, I suddenly think of the matter in Linked Fortress. I'm worried about it.
CanAcceptMenu_34596=What do you want?
CanAcceptMenu_34597=What do you mean?
CanAcceptMenu_34598=To tell you the truth, Shi Huhu also wanted you to persuade Qiu Baisui.
CanAcceptMenu_34599=Please think about it carefully, Leader.
CanAcceptMenu_34621=Have you finished the Letter, Leader Qiu?
CanAcceptMenu_34622=See who I am clearly!
CanAcceptMenu_34623=What are Royal Guards going to do in Yanjing in the near future?
CanAcceptMenu_34624=Tell me, what is the plan of Royal Guards this time?
CanAcceptMenu_34625=You're so annoying.
CanAcceptMenu_34626=Spit it out! I don't have time for this!
CanAcceptMenu_34627=Stay here and don't play any tricks!
CanAcceptMenu_34628=There are really no Royal Guards here?
CanAcceptMenu_34629=Royal Guards will go towards the south. I'll follow them. Wang Xiao is here. You can take him back!
CanAcceptMenu_34630=Which rooms are those Royal Guards in?
CanAcceptMenu_34631=Why you are stealthy? I don't think you are a good person.
CanAcceptMenu_34632=Injury is unavoidable.
CanAcceptMenu_34633=Leader Xiao,
CanAcceptMenu_34634=Here is?
CanAcceptMenu_34635=Girl, I only...
CanAcceptMenu_34636=How do you know?
CanAcceptMenu_34637=Delightful Forest? Why do they come?
CanAcceptMenu_34638=Their martial arts are good. What should we do?
CanAcceptMenu_34639=What happened?
CanAcceptMenu_34640=Why did you come to Wudang to make trouble?
CanAcceptMenu_34641=Answer my question, why did you come to Wudang?
CanAcceptMenu_34642=Tao-zhang, did you know that?
CanAcceptMenu_34663=What should we do now, Tao-zhang?
CanAcceptMenu_34664=Which Royal Guards do you know about?
CanAcceptMenu_34665=Could you remember it?
CanAcceptMenu_34666=Tell me the truth quickly.
CanAcceptMenu_34667=What on earth are you doing in Luoyang?
CanAcceptMenu_34668=Are you still so confident?
CanAcceptMenu_34669=Well, waiter, did those Royal Guards have meals in your restaurant?
CanAcceptMenu_34670=Did you get it done?
CanAcceptMenu_34671=You had better quit early.
CanAcceptMenu_34672=It's too bad.
CanAcceptMenu_34673=Where did those Royal Guards go?
CanAcceptMenu_34674=Elder Shi, let me help you deal with them.
CanAcceptMenu_34675=Ok, I am about to go now.
CanAcceptMenu_34676=What should we do now?
CanAcceptMenu_34677=What should we deal with Murong Diyun?
CanAcceptMenu_34678=Why did you resort to violent treachery against your sister?
CanAcceptMenu_34679=Elder, what did you come over to see me for?
CanAcceptMenu_34680=I hope brother Qin can tell me.
CanAcceptMenu_34681=I didn't kill Elder Xu!
CanAcceptMenu_34682=Yes, I gave the flute to Royal Guards, so Leader Xiao is innocent.
CanAcceptMenu_34683=Incense leader Fan, did you get any information on Royal Guards?
CompleteMenu_34578=Leader Lin, long time no see. This is my salute to you.
CompleteMenu_34579=Thanks for telling me, Leader.
CompleteMenu_34580=Leader Lin, I still don't know what I should do next.
CompleteMenu_34581=Aunt, your grandson isn't near here. Do you have any other clue?
CompleteMenu_34582=It's ok, Aunt.
CompleteMenu_34583=Leader, I plan to seek benefits for Civilians in the future, and offer my pygmy effort for people in the world.
CompleteMenu_34584=Who are you?
CompleteMenu_34585=Wait for me here. I'll be back soon.
CompleteMenu_34586=Do you feel better?
CompleteMenu_34587=Who are you?
CompleteMenu_34588=Who are you?
CompleteMenu_34589=Thank you very much, Miss.
CompleteMenu_34590=Sorry to offend you.
CompleteMenu_34591=What on earth do you want?
CompleteMenu_34592=Are you Foolish Aunt?
CompleteMenu_34593=I've got the Peachblossoms for you.
CompleteMenu_34594=Leader Lin, I'm back.
CompleteMenu_34595=Surrender now?
CompleteMenu_34596=Why you are here?
CompleteMenu_34597=Thanks for telling me, girl.
CompleteMenu_34598=Leader Qiu, this is a Letter of your daughter. Please don't be stirred up by others.
CompleteMenu_34599=That's so good.
CompleteMenu_34621=You are a Royal Guards Red Flag Disciple?
CompleteMenu_34622=I want to ask you something. Will you ask more brothers to come here?
CompleteMenu_34623=I need to ask you something!
CompleteMenu_34624=Have you finished? Put away your Waist Ornament!
CompleteMenu_34625=Confess or not?
CompleteMenu_34626=I think Royal Guards are no big deal. Let's wait and see!
CompleteMenu_34627=Waiter, did you see any Royal Guards nearby?
CompleteMenu_34628=You're a Beggar's Sect Disciple, right?
CompleteMenu_34629=Sir, I'd like to ask you.
CompleteMenu_34630=Who are you?
CompleteMenu_34631=Why don't you speak? What important matter?
CompleteMenu_34632=I didn't expect this would all happen so suddenly.
CompleteMenu_34633=You just...
CompleteMenu_34634=Girl, don't get excited so easily because I'm not here to steal the sword.
CompleteMenu_34635=Miss Hong, I have something to seek your advice.
CompleteMenu_34636=What's wrong with you? What happened?
CompleteMenu_34637=Lots of disciples in Delightful Forest came here. I repelled some of them, but there are still many disciples left.
CompleteMenu_34638=What's wrong?
CompleteMenu_34639=Why did you come to Wudang to make trouble?
CompleteMenu_34640=You lost! You're a simple mantis trying to stop a chariot!
CompleteMenu_34641=Tao-zhang, Delightful Forest was also instigated.
CompleteMenu_34642=I see.
CompleteMenu_34663=I'm willing to help Delightful Forest find young Stronghold Leader. I hope Brother Yan can help me.
CompleteMenu_34664=These are your silver. Do you know where Royal Guards hide at the moment?
CompleteMenu_34665=I have a question and you had better answer it carefully.
CompleteMenu_34666=You're so dirty.
CompleteMenu_34667=I've notified Wudang of that and your plot will fail sooner or later.
CompleteMenu_34668=Waiter, I have something to ask you.
CompleteMenu_34669=Waiter, this is the seasoning required by those guests. Do remember to add it.
CompleteMenu_34670=Behave yourself! Your plan will definitely fail since I'll leave for the Scholars at once.
CompleteMenu_34671=Great! It's a regret that Miao Ying has fled away.
CompleteMenu_34672=What's wrong with you?
CompleteMenu_34673=Elder Shi! Are you okay?
CompleteMenu_34674=Elder Shi, I don't think Diyun is in a good situation.
CompleteMenu_34675=Elder Shi, do you think Diyun is recovering?
CompleteMenu_34676=Here you are. Tell me where's your master?
CompleteMenu_34677=Murong Weiyu
CompleteMenu_34678=You are?
CompleteMenu_34679=Something big is happening.
CompleteMenu_34680=Is Elder Xu dead?
CompleteMenu_34681=No, Incense Leader, Royal Guards did this!
CompleteMenu_34682=We are wondering how to deal with Royal Guards!
CompleteMenu_34683=They have taken action.
accept_34578_1=Many villagers have been murdered. I'm investigating.
accept_34579_1=Nine Yin Diagram is the essentials of martial arts. I'll answer your questions.
accept_34580_1=Em...all right, you should know your parentage now.
accept_34581_1=Go back to the inn and have a rest. You'll find your answer one day.
accept_34582_1=My husband said some mysterious boats passed by the Gate of Suzhou Water City. Maybe this has something to do with it.
accept_34583_1=It's so good to have you. We don't need to be a state of anxiety in the future.
accept_34585_1=I came to find the island owner, Mr. Huang, but now I'm lost. How can I get out?
accept_34586_1=<s>Heart-losing? Does it mean lovelorn?
accept_34587_1=I'm not ok at all. I hope you can help me to the end. I've lost my way in the Peachblossom Array for a long time. You seem to be connected with the Array. Can you bring me out?
accept_34588_1=I haven't condemned you for intruding, but I don't want any relation with Lin Tiannan. You can go.
accept_34589_1=Certainly. My dad is fond of me the most. If I ask him...it'll be easy. Wait here. Don't run about. It won't be good to you if you anger him.
accept_34590_1=<s>You're silly, how can you see my dad?
accept_34591_1=<s>Don't leave now. Let me test you.
accept_34592_1=Master has a strong character. You won't be able to escape if he doesn't want you to leave. Go to find Foolish Aunt now. She'll help you. No time is left. Go now.
accept_34593_1=<s> I want Peachblossoms. I'll help you if there are. Let's become Sworn Friends if there are Peachblossoms.
accept_34594_1=With me, you need not fear Huang. If I go play with him, you can leave.
accept_34595_1=<s>You should go to the Twelve-Linked Fortress to look for clues about the Nine Yin Diagram.
accept_34596_1=<s>I must find Brother Qiu to vent my anger for me. Wait and see.
accept_34597_1=Find Qiu Sai'er. He might be able to calm Brother Qiu.
accept_34598_1=<s>Take this letter to my father. Maybe he'll see my side of things.
accept_34599_1=What Sai'er said is true. I'll spare you today.
accept_34621_1=<s>It's done. Here it is. Please bring it to Leader Xiao.
accept_34622_1=You don't know how to do business. Brothers, let's punish him.
accept_34623_1=Please give me some food. I only joined the Royal Guards because of the uniform.
accept_34624_1=<s>Oh, so it's misunderstanding. I'm not a member of Royal Guards. You must have been mistaken.
accept_34625_1=<s>What do you want? Why do you hit at my acupoints? You!
accept_34626_1=<s>The Royal Guards plan to seize control of each neutral school. Then, we will be the most powerful sect in the world.
accept_34627_1=You only know to hit acupoints. Have a big fight with me if you're capable!
accept_34628_1=Sir, you know that Royal Guards are not to be trifled with. I can tell you, but don't tell others. Now many of their Leaders live here, and one looks handsome...Anyway, they'll start off soon. I saw them preparing the horses.
accept_34629_1=<s>Is it Royal Guards Red Flag Emissary? That's great. We must be able to expose the plot of Royal Guards this time.
accept_34630_1=I usually don't tell the situation of guests to others, but these Royal Guards have been rude and unreasonable. Let me tell you. Their rooms are on the second floor. They just went out. You can go to see if there's any clue.
accept_34631_1=It's misunderstanding! Don't be impetuous!
accept_34632_1=<s>Forget it. I can't beat you. Let me give you the information of Leader Xiao first.
accept_34633_1=Yes, Leader Xiao hopes you can see Tao-zhang Chongxu in Wudang and find it out. If Beggar's Sect shows up now, it may create a disturbance. The Leader is afraid of being exploited, and it will be unrecoverable.
accept_34634_1=<s>Sword Robbing Thief! You even dare to intrude the Sword Tomb!
accept_34635_1=<s>I drew them here!
accept_34636_1=<s>Just now Qu Yi played the flute beneath the mountain to communicate the information, so I know some situation.
accept_34637_1=I don't know, but there is a large number of them. They're assembling beneath the mountain.
accept_34638_1=<s>We can't try our best to fight them now since there are a large number of them. We must crush them one by one. You go to the Side Door first, and I go to the Portal. They won't expect we'll be so fast. Don't lose the advantage.
accept_34639_1=They took turns to fight, and some people were attacking aside. Please go to help them. It's dangerous in Portal and Back Hill Door.
accept_34640_1=<s>I'll tell you if you can defeat us.
accept_34641_1=<s>Someone used the message of Young master as a condition to ask us to attack Wudang. But it's okay for me as long as I can kill people, hah!
accept_34642_1=As a taoist, I just heard of that. In my opinion, perhaps this affair is derived from the North!
accept_34663_1=<s>In my opinion, we had better help Delightful Forest for the time being.
accept_34664_1=<s>Actually I don't know too many details on this, but my subordinate got a message that they have headed for Luoyang.
accept_34665_1=<s>I remembered that. I saw some Royal Guards ride high horses and check in when passing by the nearby inn. But I don't know whether they have left or not...
accept_34666_1=I'm Purple Flag Emissary of Royal Guards. Even a mere nobody like you want to dishonor me?
accept_34667_1=We only stay in Luoyang so as to monitor certain people. We won't be of much use since you took the bait.
accept_34668_1=<s>It's time for the army of Royal Guards to approach the Scholars now. You have no time to support them even if you get the message. Once the Scholars are overthrown, our Royal Guards force will expand further and even become No. 1 gang around the world!
accept_34669_1=<s>I just want to serve it for them? Why did you ask about it?
accept_34670_1=You can rest assured that everything has been done successfully. I've completely added it to their Meals.
accept_34671_1=You've made me suffer such a burning shame and, as a result, I'll let you more dead than alive in the future.
accept_34672_1=<s>Seemingly Royal Guards take actions fast.
accept_34673_1=They broke it through. Despite the headmaster's profound martial arts, what I concern is the large number of Royal Guards, plus their insidious means...<br><s>Look out, your back...
accept_34674_1=The younger generation like you having such a courage are rarely seen. So let me appreciate your martial arts!
accept_34675_1=<s>I heard some people in the Scholars were biased against you before. Please forgive them!
accept_34676_1=Now the only way is to find Murong Weiyu. She must know the solution.
accept_34677_1=My owner also wanted me to tell you that, if you go to find Danyang Grass, you'll be able to reconcile the Internal Injury of Murong Diyun.
accept_34678_1=<s>How is Diyun?
accept_34679_1=<s>It still needs further consideration.
accept_34680_1=After you left, leader Xiao suddenly got a dependable message that the Imperial Court would take big actions.
accept_34681_1=<s>Can it be others except you?
accept_34682_1=What! It was you who gave that flute to Royal Guards. So you're working together with Royal Guards!
accept_34683_1=A number of Royal Guards have arrived in Suzhou. I don't believe they'll ever leave.
complete_34578=Don't go to so much trouble about me. It's distant. What are you doing here?
complete_34579=<s>You're welcome. Some misunderstand you, but you'll be respected one day.
complete_34580=This is not your fault. After all, you need to think about something by yourself.
complete_34581=<s>My grandson has disappeared. How can I go on?
complete_34582=<s>You're a true hero.
complete_34583=<s>Ok, you can make such a decision. I'm gratified.
complete_34584=Who are you? I'm only me.
complete_34585=<s>Where are you going?
complete_34586=<s>I feel much better. Thank you.
complete_34587=You run about in my Array, but you even don't know who I am.
complete_34588=I heard what you and my dad talked about just now. You're nice. Let me help you, ok?
complete_34589=You're welcome. Be careful if you're involved.
complete_34590=I didn't expect you to be so powerful.
complete_34591=<s>You'll be defeated if you compete with the island owner again. Youngest sister asked me to help you.
complete_34592=Foolish Aunt, everyone calls me Foolish Aunt. How do you know?
complete_34593=Ok, let's become Sworn Friends.
complete_34594=<s>It's good you're back.
complete_34595=<s>Don't be arrogant. This is the territory of Linked Fortress. I'm not a person to trifle with.
complete_34596=Listen to me, you can't act rashly though your martial art is better than his. Brother Qiu is not bloodthirsty...
complete_34597=<s>I'd like to ask you for help...
complete_34598=What stirring up? Let me see.
complete_34599=So the Imperial Court will harm us. This is unusual. You must be careful.
complete_34621=<s>What are you? I don't want to buy anything. Get out!
complete_34622=<s>I dare not. Please ask, I'll answer all your questions.
complete_34623=I must answer you when you ask me? Who do you think you are? I lost to you by accident just now, so what?
complete_34624=I'm a gentleman, so I can't be disloyal!
complete_34625=<s>It's itchy, so itchy. I confess!
complete_34626=<s>Don't try to be brave. Isn't it better to submit to us early?
complete_34627=Royal Guards? Sir, please have a look in other place. I'm not clear about it!
complete_34628=The leader asked me to look for you long ago.
complete_34629=Say it please. We provide good service.
complete_34630=I'm...
complete_34631=<s>My teeth! You're cruel!
complete_34632=Leader Xiao has a foreboding too...
complete_34633=<s>Forbidden Instance of Sword Tomb. Why you are here!
complete_34634=<s>What are you doing in Sword Tomb?
complete_34635=<s>Qu Yi asked you to come, right?
complete_34636=<s>Someone reported that numerous people are climbing up Wudang to attack massively...
complete_34637=<s>What? Why do they come to Wudang?
complete_34638=A few criminals have plotted against me.
complete_34639=Don't ask. You're not a Wudang Disciple. What the hell are you doing here
complete_34640=You'll never know until the last moment.
complete_34641=<s>So that's the case...
complete_34642=<s>Take great care in the future.
complete_34663=<s>I can't oppose you. I'm easy to report.
complete_34664=<s>Let me think...I remember I saw it...
complete_34665=<s>Who do you think you are? Do you want to criticize me?
complete_34666=<s>Any means for success are acceptable.
complete_34667=<s>Don't look so pleased. No one knows who the winner will be.
complete_34669=<s>Sorry to bring much trouble to you, sir.
complete_34670=Wow.
complete_34671=How is it going on now? Please explain it in detail.
complete_34672=<s>Many Royal Guards attack and climb up the mountain. I intended to defend the Mountain Gate, but I couldn't rival...
complete_34673=<s>I'm fine, but there are too many Royal Guards...
complete_34674=I learnt that one of martial arts practiced in Royal Guards Place was very insidious. So let me take care of her. You should first have a look at the leader's situation!
complete_34675=<s>It's...just alleviated temporarily, but not cured...
complete_34676=You're very obedient.
complete_34677=<s>You have finally come, but you're too slow.
complete_34678=<s>I'm Xu Liyu from the Beggar's Sect. You're new in town, so I came to see you.
complete_34679=<s>Indeed, it's a thorny problem.
complete_34680=<s>Don't pretend to be foolish again. Can it be others except you?
complete_34681=<s>Royal Guards? However, ...
complete_34682=<s>It makes sense.
complete_34683=<s>It's not so simple. Wanderer's Valley is working with the Royal Guards
context_34578=Many villagers have been murdered. I'm investigating.

context_34665=I remembered that. I saw some Royal Guards ride high horses and check in when passing by the nearby inn. But I don't know whether they have left or not...
context_34666=I'm Purple Flag Emissary of Royal Guards. Even a mere nobody like you want to dishonor me?
context_34667=We only stay in Luoyang so as to monitor certain people. We won't be of much use since you took the bait.
context_34668=It's time for the army of Royal Guards to approach the Scholars now. You have no time to support them even if you get the message. Once the Scholars are overthrown, our Royal Guard force will expand further and even become No. 1 gang around the world!
context_34669=I just want to serve it for them? Why did you ask about it?
context_34670=You can rest assured that everything has been done successfully. I've completely added it to their Meals.
context_34671=You've made me suffer such a burning shame and, as a result, I'll let you more dead than alive in the future.
context_34672=Seemingly Royal Guards take actions fast.
context_34673=They broke it through. Despite the headmaster's profound martial arts, what I concern is the large number of Royal Guards, plus their insidious means...Look out, your back...
context_34674=The younger generation like you having such a courage are rarely seen. So let me appreciate your martial arts!
context_34675=I heard some people in the Scholars were biased against you before. Please forgive them!
context_34676=Now the only way is to find Murong Weiyu. She must know the solution.
context_34677=My owner also wanted me to tell you that, if you go to find Danyang Grass, you'll be able to reconcile the Internal Injury of Murong Diyun.
context_34678=How is Diyun?
context_34679=It still needs further consideration.
context_34680=After you left, leader Xiao suddenly got a dependable message that the Imperial Court would take big actions.
context_34681=Can it be others except you?
context_34682=What! It was you who gave that flute to Royal Guards. So you're working together with Royal Guards!
context_34683=A number of Royal Guards have arrived in Suzhou. I don't believe they'll ever leave.

menu_34637_1=What? I'll go to help them!
menu_34638_1=Ok, I am about to go now.
menu_34639_1=Don't worry. I'll go now.
menu_34640_1=Bastard! Get out of the way before I kill you!
menu_34641_1=I gotta go and inform Wudang of that.
menu_34642_1=What?
menu_34663_1=Why? They're originally evil sects.
menu_34664_1=Ok, I am about to go now.
menu_34665_1=Many thanks, I'll go there to have a look at it immediately.
menu_34666_1=You should have avoided that!
menu_34667_1=I didn't expect it like this! I will never make your plot succeed.
menu_34668_1=What!
menu_34669_1=Wait a minute. They are very tricky. So don't serve the dishes until I'm back, otherwise they will smash your restaurant.
menu_34670_1=Stand here and don't step in it for now.
menu_34671_1=Any time.
menu_34672_1=Indeed, so far as I know...
menu_34673_1=Who dare take such liberties?
menu_34674_1=Speak so seriously, elder Shi. Give it to me.
menu_34675_1=Elder Shi is too modest.
menu_34676_1=Okay, I'll go to find her.
menu_34677_1=It is actually like this.
menu_34678_1=You still has the cheek to ask?
menu_34679_1=Elder, please speak.
menu_34680_1=Imperial Court?
menu_34681_1=I'll go to see it!
menu_34682_1=That's not the case, not the case!
menu_34683_1=It makes sense.
