context_73901=Alliance leader Lin Tiannan has already contacted the sect leaders. Many sects have found traces of Silent Temple spies' activity beforehand, but they chose to deal with it alone because of their differences. Now the Silent Temple is rising in power, Lin Tiannan and the sect leaders have decided to select an envoy to help them communicate with each other and to solve the threat of Silent Temple together. Maybe more clues could be found.
context_73902=After learning your purpose, Xuanhuai tells you that Zu Cheng's old room is kept as it was all these years. You can go have a look.
context_73903=Search Zu Cheng's room. See if there are any clues.
context_73904=After pretending to leave Shaolin, the monk who secretly studied you from before sneakily follows you. You walk to a secluded spot, suddenly uses flying skill to gain distance from him, then finds a suitable roadside to hide and observe. The monk thinks he lost his target and searches for you nearby. You wait for the right moment, rushes out and attacks him. He is subdued after a fierce fight.
context_73905=You return to the temple to visit Abbot Xuanhuai and tells him what has happened. The abbot is troubled that there are still Silent Temple spies in Shaolin. You deduce that Zu Cheng must have left something important behind, and the Silent Temple is still looking for it. Ask Xuanhuai where it might be hidden.
context_73906=Abbot Xuanhuai is shocked after reading the letter. It lists some names of people belonging to the major sects, including: Yu Mengqiu from Scholars, Xuanyuan Chuqing from Emei, and Xuanyuan Kuanglang from Royal Guards. They are all people in high places. The matter is urgent. You must report this to Lin Tiannan.
context_73907=After Lin Tiannan hears your story, he tells you that Yu Mengqiu has already been discovered. And that Royal Guards is still in close contact with the Imperial Court, and since the court is investigating the Silent Temple, they would be working together. You wouldn't be much help there if they don't trust you. In Emei Abbess Juechen already have suspicions about Xuanyuan Chuqing's past. But the girl is kind hearted and never did anything to harm Emei or Wulin, so the abbess never confronted her about it. The matter is complicated. Lin Tiannan wants you to go to Emei to see if there are any clues. Suddenly, Silent Temple followers appear......
context_73908=Xuanyuan Chuqing seems to know that the alliance leader is looking for her. She says after spending her years in Emei and being treated with honesty from her sisters, now she would never do anything to harm her sect. She also tells you that many people is watching the alliance leader. You are alone and outnumbered, so you should stay away from the drama to protect yourself. You learned Xuanyuan Chuqing is only a piece of the puzzle, and she don't want to be involved any longer. You don't want to disturb her peace but you also don't want to give up your investigation. You ask Xuanyuan Chuqing for advice but she won't say a word. You leave her, but......
context_73909=You two kill Zhao Zhi after a tense fight. Xuanyuan Kuanglang is hesitant in fighting you since both of you are now severely injured. No one is certain who would be the last one left standing. He warns you no matter what you know you must mind your own business. Not only are Silent Temple and Tianwaitian your enemies, the Imperial Court and Royal Guards are also known for their bloodlust. You might still live if you choose to disappear now. And if you do any harm to Xuanyuan Chuqing, you will end up just like Zhao Zhi.
context_73910=Go back to Suzhou and report to Lin Tiannan. After Lin Tiannan learns that the Royal Guards and Imperial Court is now involved, he knows that it would be difficult for him to take part in the matter while the rumors about him is still spreading. He tells you to go to Lord Qin Manor to help after he take his leave. Progress might be made over there, but you must always be careful with Lord Qin and don't trust all his words.
