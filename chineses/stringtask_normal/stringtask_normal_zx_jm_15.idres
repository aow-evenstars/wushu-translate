CanAcceptMenu_28673=Do you know how to get into Three-god Mountain?
CanAcceptMenu_28674=What is in the Three-god Mountain? Can you tell me?
CanAcceptMenu_28675=Ah, this is not the right attitude. Did you not know all of these money were dirty money?
CanAcceptMenu_28676=Three-god Mountain is filled with thugs and outcasts. Why are you joining them?
CanAcceptMenu_28677=Then what? It's my mercy to not be giving you, lowly peasant, to the authorities.
CanAcceptMenu_28678=Have you seen a guest inquiring about heading to Three-god Mountain?
CanAcceptMenu_28679=Xuewu Stronghold? Is that the one our villager Ying Rushi wants to join? Where is it?
CanAcceptMenu_28685=Who am I? You'll be begging for my mercy when I tell you! I am the Secret Association Poison Maker. This is a secret letter for your villa leader, go get your leader now!
CanAcceptMenu_28686=I am here on Secret Association Leader's order for a serious matter. I hope you will cooperate.
CanAcceptMenu_28687=You don't need to be so mannerly with me. When the Secret Association finally conquer the Wulin, you would have had an integral part in the effort.
CanAcceptMenu_28688=What matter? Oh, THAT matter! Yeah, I know what to do.
CanAcceptMenu_28689=Second Leader is too courteous. Is Villa Leader in the villa right now?
CanAcceptMenu_28690=Good. When the deed is done, Wulin will fall into chaos, and we will benefit from it with the least effort.
CanAcceptMenu_28691=These Six Gates have their hands reached beyond where they need to be. Didn't you tell him our background?
CanAcceptMenu_28692=Second Leader has some unspoken concerns?
CanAcceptMenu_28698=Don't worry. This is a secret mission, even though it is quite difficult.
CanAcceptMenu_28699=In that case, what is your plan?
CanAcceptMenu_28700=As long as you are loyal to the Secret Association, we will treat you accordingly. What is your next step?
CanAcceptMenu_28701=Second Leader is dead. Have you made arrangements for all the mundane matters?
CanAcceptMenu_28702=Even though the Secret Association is mysterious, it does not open doors to everyone. Someone that accomplish great things will not dwell on minor details. Please consider carefully.
CanAcceptMenu_28703=Good. You are indeed as wise as I expected.
CanAcceptMenu_28704=Fourth Leader? Who are you?
CanAcceptMenu_28705=The priority now is to rescue Zhang Liang. He seems to know the whereabouts of Fourth Leader. I didn't carry any medicine. Do you have any?
CanAcceptMenu_28706=Do you know where Fourth Leader is? Why did he hurt you?
CanAcceptMenu_28711=Quit the chatter, stinky monk. Get out of my way if you know better, or you will regret it.
CanAcceptMenu_28712=Narrow-mindedness is not a trait of a gentleman. Ruthlessness is the mark of a truly great man
CanAcceptMenu_28713=Abbot Xuyuan, I am here to inform you of something!
CanAcceptMenu_28714=Abbot, I...
CanAcceptMenu_28715=I have wounded the Living Buddha, and hurt your disciple. Why does Abbot not scold me?
CanAcceptMenu_28716=Ok. I will go greet the Three Gods Priest. Please arrange the rest.
CompleteMenu_28673=I have heard that after you enter the Three-god Mountain, you will be worry-free. You can eat and drink to all your heart's content!
CompleteMenu_28674=I heard you would like to join the Three-god Mountain. They are just a group of evil thugs. You are still young, and has a promising life ahead of you. Why join in their ranks?
CompleteMenu_28675=You are Yuan Qing? I heard you would like to join the Three-god Mountain?
CompleteMenu_28676=I have dragged Yuan Qing back. Hope all of you have learnt the lesson and don't go astray again.
CompleteMenu_28677=Hey, boss. Was there a prominent guest hanging here just now?
CompleteMenu_28678=Hey, have you seen a rich merchant looking for someone passing by earlier?
CompleteMenu_28679=This must be Xuewu Stronghold? Go notify your Villa Leader.
CompleteMenu_28685=You are the Fourth Leader of Xuewu Stronghold?
CompleteMenu_28686=You are the Second Leader of Xuewu Stronghold?
CompleteMenu_28687=I have gotten rid of those "nails".
CompleteMenu_28688=This is Samsara Grass. It has blood clogging and bruise removing effects. Second Leader can treat the members with it.
CompleteMenu_28690=I have drove them away. They are just the minions, nothing much.
CompleteMenu_28691=I have killed the people sent by the Six Gates. Now you and the Leader can prepare in peace.
CompleteMenu_28698=Leader, I subtly probbed the Second Leader. It seems like he have a strong hate against you, and would like to replace you.
CompleteMenu_28699=I have wiped the Second Leader from the face of the earth. You no longer have to worry about him.
CompleteMenu_28700=I have cleared out those guards and patrols.
CompleteMenu_28701=How dare the Third Leader be rude to the Secret Association. These type of people will end up being obstacles later on. I have already killed him!
CompleteMenu_28702=Grand Leader, the Fifth leader was stubborn. I had to defend myself, and the weapons were blind...
CompleteMenu_28703=You look wounded. What happened?
CompleteMenu_28704=I saw your loyal member Zhang Liang. He fainted from the heavy damage by the Fourth Leader.
CompleteMenu_28705=I have gotten a Millennium Heart Protecting Pill. You should be fine now.
CompleteMenu_28706=Get lost, stinky monk!
CompleteMenu_28711=I have killed the Fourth Leader. Now the Xuewu Stronghold is yours to rule!
CompleteMenu_28712=Greetings to you, Abbot Xuanyuan.
CompleteMenu_28713=Abbot, this is the White Dew you asked for.
CompleteMenu_28714=Abbot, you are suffering from a horrible disease. Why don't you use those medication yourselves?
CompleteMenu_28715=Leader, is the Three Gods Priest here?
CompleteMenu_28716=Abbot, the Three Gods Priest has arrived, and I have killed it on the way.
CompleteMenu_28717=Excuse me Abbot...
accept_28673_1=<s>Three-god Mountain is very steep and heavily guarded. It would be very difficult to enter. However, Grandma Pan's Son in the village seems to want to join Three-god Mountain. You can check with her.

accept_28688_1=<s>Thank you very much. One of my brother was wounded while getting jumbled up with the Six Gates. Since you are the Secret Association Poison Maker, could you please grant my brother some medicine?
accept_28689_1=The elder brother is inside. Please come in!
accept_28690_1=<s>You are the most wise! The Six Gates has really been getting in our way recently. Not only did they bribed some of our brothers, but they also brought an expert in martial arts. We ended up with a lot of wounded brothers.
accept_28691_1=<s>You are teasing us. We would not leak anything while we work for the Secret Association. Sometimes we have to get the short end of the stick for that, but we just persevere through.

accept_28706_1=<s>Fourth Leader heard that all the other leaders died one by one, so he decided to leave. Too bad my skills were limited, and I was not able to stop him. Based on his escaping route, he should have gone to the Meili Temple in the mountains.

accept_28714_1=<s>Amitabha. The saying goes, saving a person must be a persisting effort, just like escorting the Buddha to the west. This is the Xiaohuan Pill I just made from the herb. Please give this to the lady outside to treat her seriously ill mother.
accept_28715_1=<s>Amitabha, monks refrains from temper and anger. You were clearly going easy on my silly disciple earlier, and you were willing to run the two errands for me. I don't see you as a person of extreme evil. Plus...

complete_28673=<s>Sigh. If only Three-god Mountain was that great.
complete_28674=<s>Hmph, you know nothing. After you get on Three-god Mountain, money and women are all mine to wield. That is the pleasure of life!
complete_28675=<s>Yes, I am. What's up? You would like to join me in my journey?
complete_28676=<s>Pfft, you may have us now, but you can't be on us for ever. It's my advice to you to promptly release us, otherwise...
complete_28677=<s>There are many passerby day in and day out. It's not like they mark their face. How would I know who is a prominent guest.
complete_28678=<s>Oh, there was one. Heading over to Xuewu Stronghold.
complete_28679=<s>Who are you? Sounding all bumptious.
complete_28685=<s>Oh, you must be the Secret Association master. Fourth Leader has gone up the mountain.
