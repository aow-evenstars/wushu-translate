17339=<font color="#ff0000">Liu Fangshuo: Fang Xiaoru's family was eliminated by Zhu Di. Fang Wuhen is a disciple of Shaolin, but in fact he's the son of Fang Xiaoru. You can persuade him by this. He will change his mind for certain, and I will help you too. Go! </font>
17340=<font color="#ffff00">A bunch of Wulin guys and Ming troops are attacking the jails in the hope of rescuing Fang Wuhen!</font>
17341=Fang Wuhen: You speak nonsense. Get out!
17342=Fang Wuhen: You scum. You live off the Ming Dynasty yet serve those Hu dogs. Do not speak to me!
17343=Fang Wuhen: How can one babble on to me like this? Go jump off a cliff or something.
17344=Fang Wuhen: Sorry, what was it you said?
17345=Fang Wuhen: What you said is terribly disordered, wordy, inarticulate and repetitive. Get way from me.
17346=Fang Wuhen: Tired? Have a drink, I will wait.
17347=Fang Wuhen: Sounds sensible. Go on.
17348=Fang Wuhen: You bastards seem good at learning about our country.
17349=Fang Wuhen: I hadn't thought about that before.
17350=Fang Wuhen: Haven't you been in a meeting before?
17351=Fang Wuhen: If you're lying, I will hollow out your skull and use it as a cup!
17352=Fang Wuhen: I never thought I could be so wrong, but now I see the truth.
17353=Fang Wuhen: What you said is sensible. (Fang Wuhen admires you)
17354=Fang Wuhen: If I follow the Marshal, will I be privy to some meat?
17355=General Fang, we are here with good news. Please calm down and listen.
17356=I, Fang Wuhen, have lived through much hardship. Come on!
17357=The Marshal spared you because he thought there was something special about you. If you choose to be ungrateful and anger the Marshal, he will behead you!
17358=If you still resist once we've breached Yanmen Pass, then no one will be spared.
17359=Do you think your death will be simple? Once we are in the Central Plains, we will purge your bloodline!
17360=Upon victory, the Marshal promises a mountain of riches, stables of horses and women! Follow us and you can have this too.
17361=General Fang, speak the words and I will do anything you ask.
17362=Join us in the fight for glory and honor at Yanmen Pass!
17363=We Tartar appreciate all types of beauty.
17364=As old saying goes "The homes of the rich reek of meat and wine, while frozen bodies lie by the roadside." The people of Zhu Yuanzhang are starving. Why not join us and help?
17365=After Zhu Di gained power, he murdered his loyal followers indisciminately. The officers did not dare to speak out. Join us against such injustice.
17366=The Ming Imperial Court are inhuman. They attack during peace, blackmail us and their soldiers treated our people like swine. Now our marshal intends to right these wrongs.
17367=Our Marshal works to help the suffering of the Central Plains. Why work against us? Instead, join our cause.
17368=Your Emperor is not the legitimate one. Emperor Yunwen has been a loyal patron for years and was granted the title "Ming Khan." We do not wish to occupy the Central Plains. The purpose of this war is to help Emperor Yunwen restore his country.
17369=There is no difference between the Mongolians and Han. We are all human, so there is no reason to kill  one another. Our Empire understands this and wants to unite us as a family of equals.
17371=I heard there was a scholar named Fang Xiaoru in Ming. After Zhu Di occupied the imperial city, Fang Xiaoru criticized Zhu Di and so his family was eliminated. Do you want the same to happen to you?
17372=Of all the talented Mings, no one can compare with Fang Xiaoru. When Zhu Di rebelled and occupied the throne, only Fang Xiaoru stood up to his tyranny, and was killed for it. With his death came the end of an era, one with virtues people have forgotten and even oppose. Your cause it for not. Surrender to us.
17373=Although Fang Xiaoru's bloodline was eliminated, some say a single son escaped. Could that be, General Fang? If so, how could he serve Zhu Di? It can only be a lie to benefit Zhu Di. For the sake of the people, this evil must be stopped.

18511=This is the genuine article.
18512=This is a counterfeit.
18528=Silently, I walk up the west tower; the lonely trees stand quietly under the soft beam of the crescent moon; the vast garden seems to have locked up all the bleakness of autumn.
18531=C: All things drift like water in a perishing stream, life floats but like a dream. Let us frequent the road to the beautiful land of the drunkards.
18532=D: Who would climb with me now to the high hall? Our autumn views, I long recall. These things are the past, emptiness overcame; just like all events in a dream.
18534=Enjoy life when there is prosperity. Never tip a gold cup to the moon when it is empty.
18535=A: Let us revel in a feast with veal and beef, and empty three hundred goblets of wine before we leave.
18536=B: The life style of the rich is all fake. I should rather stay drunk than to ever awake.
18537=C: Heaven has given me a gift and it’s my turn. All my fortune is squandered; but it will return.
18538=D: All sages in history were solitary, except those drinkers who left their glory behind.
18540=The man of Zhao with unadorned Hu tassel; he has a Wugou scimitar, bright like frost and snow. His white steed with a silver saddle; gallops swiftly like a shooting star.
18541=A: He kills one man in ten steps; leaving no trace within a thousand miles. Flicks the robes after the deed is done, leaving face and name unknown.
18542=B: Even the great Lord of Xinling, with a sword on his lap, shares roasted meat with Zhuhai while holding wine for Houying.
18543=C: Three shots and a vow will be taken; the five Sacred Mountains will crumble. When the eyes blur and the ears go warm; heroic spirits rise like a sun.
18544=D: Save the Zhao by wielding of a golden warhammer; the city of Handan is shaken. The two brave warriors of aeons; their might graces the City of Daliang.
18546=When there is no more moon and spring flowers; for me who had so many memorable hours? My attic which last night in vernal wind did stand; Reminds cruelly of the lost moonlit land.
18547=A: Carved balustrades and marble steps must still be there; but rosy faces cannot be as fair. If you ask me how much my sorrow has increased; see the rushing river flowing east!
18548=B: The starlight sparkled upon in the Pond of Sand River; and who out there was singing the Melody of Water? When the wind stopped I was about to go back as it was getting late. Alone was the moonlight shining down and reflecting in water on the lake.
18549=C: The banquet has not yet closed; music floats in the air; ice on the pond begins to melt. In a deep painted hall with candles bright; dim perfume is smelt. The thought of age turning my hair white like the snow is hard to bear.
18550=D: Who wants to spread more fragrance before fragrant spring? When drunk, I beat on rails to the beat of my heart. Do not light a red candle upon my return! I should like to see the hoofs reflect moonlight as they tread.
18551=A Famous City
18552=For ten years here I wander, and there you lay. I seldom think about you, yet how could I forget you. With your grave a thousand miles away, where can I confide my loneliness?
18553=A: A pair of white egrets fly; they have not a care in the world.
18554=B: The slow road is as long as the path to Heaven; it is easy to see the stars, but difficult to see a poet.
18555=C: Townspeople pour out from the city gate to watch the tiger-hunter.
18556=D: Even if we met, could you recognize me with dust all over my face and hair like frost?
18558=When I was little, I thought the moon was a white jade plate. Or maybe a mirror in Heaven flying through the white clouds.
18559=A: Chariots come from the yellow road, and thousands of banners shine like a rainbow. The advancing troops march north to Xiliu, and then ride east to Ganquan.
18560=B: But this consuming of the moon is for me a truly ugly scene; Filling me with a feeling of foreboding, wondering what will come out of it.
18561=C: Now the moon is being swallowed by the toad and the light flickers out leaving darkness all around; I hear that when nine of the burning suns out of the ten were ordered to be shot down by the Emperor Yao, all has since been quiet and peaceful both for heaven and man.
18562=D: First came the two legs of the fairy and the cassia tree. But for whom the rabbit kept on pounding medical herbs? I could not guess.
18564=When did the bright moon first appear? One raises his goblet, and asks the blue sky. One does not know, in the celestial palaces, what year it is this evening.
18565=A: It invokes the Ping Shan Mansion in the South where I leaned on pillows to watch smoky rain. A single goose flew into dark heights. Just as the line from the Drunken Old Man says: "The mountain is there, and yet not there."
18566=B: Circle painted pavilions, seeps over carved doors, shines on the sleepless. The moon has no regrets. Why does it glow in full over parted humans?
18567=C: I could ride the wind to return there, but fear the unbearable chill of the jade towers and their jeweled eaves. I dance with my crisp shadow in delight; could the world of mortals ever know this feeling?
18568=D: Roll up brocade curtains at sunset; water blends with the sky beneath the pavilion. You have built this for me; blue and vermilion paint is still wet upon the window sills.
18570=The call of birds hemmed in by the ancient forest echoes throughout; male birds soaring softly, following the females. And to us comes the melancholy sound of the cuckoos; out on the empty mountain, under the lonely moon.
18571=A: Though Dagger-Tower Pass be firm and grim, and while one man guards it, ten thousand cannot force it.
18572=B: Such travelling is harder than scaling the blue sky. Even to hear of it drains the color from one's face.
18573=C: Once broken by an earthquake and with many brave men lost. Just finishing the stone rungs of their ladder toward heaven.
18574=D: Such travelling is harder than scaling the blue sky. But I still face westward with a dreary groan.
18576=Remaining red fading from flowers, apricots small and green. When the swallows are hovering, the water flows around the houses. Since blown away, willow catkins on boughs diminish; such lush grass must be found the world over!
18577=A: The travelers outside the walls hears the laughter of beautiful women within. Gradually the laughter fades and no more footsteps can be heard; those with feeling are vexed by those without feeling.
18578=B: Now I am old in a lonely hillside town. Drumbeats and flute songs are drowned in prayers amid mulberries and lost forever. The lanterns are put out, dew falls with frost. Over the fields dark clouds hang low. It shall surely snow.
18580=D: That day by the embroidered drapes where we met; our eyes lowered, you pretended to flee; then smilingly tidied up your scented cloudlike tresses. Shutting down a mountain of spring, too shy to speak, Hard to reveal lightly to people emotions so deep.
18582=Men have sorrow and joy; they part or meet again; the moon is bright or dim, and may wax or wane. There has been nothing so perfect since the days of old.
18583=A: It takes a little air of vastness within to ride upon a thousand miles of crisp wind.
18584=B: We wish each other a long life so as to share the beauty of this graceful moonlight, even though we are separated by a thousand miles.
18586=D: Just as the line from the Drunken Old Man says: "The mountain is there, and yet not there."
18588=I think of the time when Ms. Xiao Qiao just married Zhou Yu; oh, how handsome and prestigious he was! But in between the feather fan and silk ribbon, through the laughter and leisurely talk, all mighty foes were swept away, dispersed like dust and smoke.
18589=A: Even I drank till I saw you again, a flower in the mirror could never be picked. Nevertheless I would still be surprised and carry on to inquire; how many strands of your hair have since turned grey and white?
18590=B: The old kingdoms, in spirit, I journeyed; through my infatuation, I only gained gray hair. Life is but a dream! I shall toast a libation to the river and her moon.
18591=C: Clear morning dew flows, fresh stems sending out buds; how much I want to travel in spring. The sun is rising, the fog disappears; will it be a beautiful day today?
18592=D: The treasured mirror is hard to find; as the clouds close in, it is difficult to see the green. The wind over the river is angry and mad; as dawn approaches, waves and turbulent floods destroy the village.
18594=Always remember the pavilion beside the brook; drunken, it helps me remember the way home at dusk.
18595=A: When asking the one rolling up the screen, she answers that the begonia is the same. Do you know it? Do you know it? It must be the green that is plump and the red that is lean.
18596=B: Sensing someone was coming, in shyness, she ran away with her unrestrained socks. Her golden pin almost fell off. Halting abruptly, she leaned against the door. Turning her head, she sniffed a green plum as if nothing had happened at all.
18597=C: To our hearts content, we were rowing back; and yet we entered deep among the water lilies by mistake. Row the boat! Ford the river quickly! Frightened birds scatter, flying over the water.
18598=D: Leaning on every spot of the railing, I am in no mood to enjoy such a scene. Where could he be now? What I see is but endless withering grass. I gaze far away; he is still nowhere to be seen.

18612=This nectar wine is full of fine bubbles and rich color. You should drink it in a clear glass to better appreciate it.
18613=You should use a jade cup to drink this fine wine! As the famous Tang poem says: "A jade bowl reigns supreme over amber rays." A jade cup enhances the rich color of this wine.
18614=This wine is of the finest quality! The aroma alone is intoxicating. It would be best to drink this fine wine from a rhino horn cup to enjoy its rich flavor.
18615=Sorghum wine is the most ancient of wines. Drinking this kind of wine is an elegant way to cherish the past.
18616=Rice wine has a good flavor but is a little weak. You have to drink a lot to get into the proper mood.
18617=Herbal wine is made by combining many different herbs. When you drink this fine wine, you will experience its fine bouquet.  You must use an antique wicker cup when drinking herbal wine. The cup is weaved from ancient wicker, which gives the wine an even more pleasant flavor.

sys_wssz_0273=Elder Sister, I have gathered the wrong herbs. Can you give me a gathering tool?
sys_wssz_0274=You have herb gathering tool in your package; you can't hold another.
sys_wssz_0275=The gathered herbs are not the right ones, and they have all been seized by Elder Sister Wu Leilei.
sys_wssz_0278=Elder Sister, I have gathered the wrong herbs. Can you give me a gathering tool?
sys_wssz_0279=Elder Sister, can you check whether these three herbs are correct?
sys_wssz_0280=Have you gathered the three "hot" herbs? I will take them away if you pick the wrong kinds. Come to me when you have finished using your gathering tool.
sys_wssz_0281=<font color="#ff0000">Zhu Wei: "The road ahead is very dangerous. It will be unwise if you insist on continuing on. I can't look on and watch you enter so much suffering. Please forgive me if I have offended you!</font>
sys_wssz_0288=I have found the tracks of those beasts. Do you want to come along?
sys_wssz_0289=Yes, please lead the way.
sys_wssz_0291=It didn't even look at you.

sys_wssz_0294=Thank you for taking me to see the elephant. Ha-ha. I am telling my buddies that I have seen an elephant.
sys_wssz_0295=Oh wow. That's an elephant.
sys_wssz_0296=Are you sure that you want to leave here?
sys_wssz_0297=I am sure.
sys_wssz_0298=It's very warm near the fire pit. It can really chase away the cold.
sys_wssz_0299=It is unusually cold here. It takes a lot of energy to chase away the cold. It seems there are a lot of firewood piles around here. Let's make a fire to chase away the cold.
sys_wssz_0300=The Villa is still in crisis, please help us.
sys_wssz_condition__103345=In order to prevent the pet from harming people, please summon it in the Beggar's Sect scene. (Hint: The current Intimacy is too low. You will be able to summon the pet at any time after the Intimacy has increased.)
sys_wssz_103345=In order to prevent the tamed beast from harming people, please summon it in the Beggar's Sect scene. (Hint: The current Intimacy is too low. You will be able to summon the tamed beast at any time after the Intimacy has increased.)
sys_ymg_0000=We traveled thousands of miles here to Yanmen Pass in order to restore Emperor Jianwen's Ming Dynasty, even if it means being called rebels. Listen to the orders the leader has for us for our next mission.
sys_ymg_0001=People who do great things sometimes have to overlook some of the small details. Although we have been forced to take refuge in a foreign tribe, what we are really doing is taking advantage of foreign tribes to help go against Zhu Di in order to restore Emperor Jianwen and the Ming Dynasty. You must remember.
sys_ymg_0002=Miss, we will follow you to the death!
sys_ymg_0003=Our forefathers' experience tells us the foreign tribes cannot be trusted. We should be careful and not show any weakness. First take refuge with Lu Zhong's rebel forces, then wait for an opportunity to gain the trust of the Tartar Tribe.
sys_ymg_0004=I understand.
sys_ymg_0005=There is no time to hesitate. In order to gain the trust of Lu Zhong, the villagers of East Spring Village and the Ming Dynasty guards must be sacrificed. This is all for restoring the great Ming Dynasty. Their sacrifices will not be in vain. We must not hesitate or else the rebel troops might see a weakness. Remember, going down this path means we will be forever written in history as traitors. Be brave and fight to the end.
sys_ymg_0006=However, if you encounter a guard named Wuhen Fang, you must not kill him. Do not be reckless. This person is important to our cause of restoring the Ming Dynasty.
sys_ymg_0007=Miss, Wuhen Fang is a mere border-defending soldier. What is it that you see in him?
sys_ymg_0008=Although Wuhen Fang is only a petty soldier, he is in fact gifted in both academics and martial arts and has great potential for great achievements in the future. Furthermore, his birth is related to a great secret that will impact the survival or destruction of the Yanmen Pass. Liu Fangshuo has been planning to engage with him for a long time. This person is a critical to our cause of restoring the Ming Dynasty. We must capture him first.
sys_ymg_0009=General Fang, I have something to say! Actually...
sys_ymg_0010=You people receive salaries from the Ming Dynasty but are willing wag your tails like dogs to the foreign tribes, killing our people and causing chaos on our land. Stop saying nonsense and die!
sys_ymg_0011=Good work. Liu Fangshuo entrusted us with the responsibility of persuading the surrender, which shows how much he trusts us. This person is capable of single-handedly fighting and capturing Wuhen Fang. We must be careful of him. Tomorrow, we will be Tartar Tribe lobbyists, but will secretly inform Wuhen Fang of our real intentions. This person is not stupid. He will surely make the right decision.
sys_ymg_0012=This General Fang would rather break than bend and is very loyal to the Ming emperor. Why would he listen to us?
sys_ymg_0013=Not necessarily. Wuhen Fang's father was the famous Xiaoru Fang, who, after the War of Jingnan, would rather die than betray his country and was later killed. Zhu Di also killed his entire family, including all close and distant relatives. Wuhen Fang was saved by someone and was able to avoid being killed. However, how could one ever forget the person who killed his family? Revenge is inevitable.
sys_ymg_0014=Liu Fangshuo knows this very well. He must have spent a lot of time doing research.
sys_ymg_0016=I am just worried that the general will not believe what we say.
sys_ymg_0017=If that happens, I will go to my contingency plan. All you have to do is get me a chance to meet him face to face. I will think of a way to distract Ji'er Ma (the door guard responsible for the Beautiful Woman Plan). You guys go tell the truth as fast as possible. Go!
sys_ymg_0018=Being a servant of the Han people, trying to rely on foreign tribes to restore our country would be like asking a tiger to turn over its own skin. However, as long as were are careful, it might still be a feasible plan.
sys_ymg_0019=We are all people who had survives Zhu Di's blade.
sys_ymg_0020=The Dark Shadow Cave is a secret base that the Ming Dynasty's army used to conduct a surprise strike on the Tartar Tribe. Its military supplies and provisions are abundant. Its destruction would be a significant blow to the morale of the Ming Dynasty army. Inside the Dark Shadow Cave are good men and women that are protecting our country. Sister, do we really want to do this? If Yanmen Pass really...
sys_ymg_0021=Zhongyi, our Fang family has been loyal people for generations. Once we take on the path of a rebel, we will have to see it through to the end and succeed. Otherwise, we would be ashamed to go see our various ancestors! The only way to make Zhu Di personally lead his army in battle is to defeat the troops at Yanmen Pass. In order to achieve this, all sacrifices are worth it. Don't worry, they will not have bled in vain!
sys_ymg_0022=Lahu Ertuo is keeping Zhongyi by his side in the name of managing the troops in war. Could he have seen through our plans? No, that is impossible. We stick to the plan to take General's Hill!
sys_ymg_0023=As long as the red cannons are still standing, the Yanmen Pass shall not be conquered. Lahu Ertuo is using Zhongyi to make us charge into the city. It is clear that he wants us to die in battle. I have under-estimated Liu Fangshuo! However, as long as Zhongyi is safe, he will surely be able to restore Emperor Jianwen and defeat the Tartar tribe. However, I may not be able to see that day. Disciples, if you leave now, you will still be able to preserve a good name. Once you charge the city, you will never be able to convince people of your innocence again. What is your decision?
sys_ymg_0024=We will follow Ms. Sui to the death!
sys_ymg_0025=Prince Zhu has a vicious move called the "Step Above the World", which you could counter using the "Shield of the Dragon" move that you can learn from me. (Hint: this move can only be learned by one warrior at a time)

info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_1_2=Impossible! Don't even think about it!
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_1_3=Ke Jun? There is something wrong with that kid. He is always making enemies. He is probably dead in some forest somewhere as we speak. Why don't you just forget about that kid? Let's go to Zuixian Tower and get drunk.
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_1_4=Sob... Young Master Ke... if Young Master Ke were here...
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_1_5=What a joke! I have so much money that most women can't keep their legs crossed around me. How dare a whore like you disrespect me. Do you believe that I can send you back and then enjoy you every day and night?

info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_1_7=Interests can be cultivated. Yanxing Escort Agency Escorts make at least 100 teals per month. In addition, we are sometimes able to capture road bandits to exchange for some beer money. Do you know how many women are interested in me? How dare you reject me!

info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_2_5=In terms of money, that Ke Jun boy goes on missions every day. He does not make a lot of money but he sure does make a lot of enemies. Every time I do an escort case, I make a load of money. Anyone with a set of eyes can see the difference here.
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_2_6=(The horse casually glances at you)
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_2_7=I don't believe that Ke Jun boy is any better than me in terms of looks. You can make a comparison yourself. I have soft skin and a good look. That Ke Jun boy has ugly hair and looks like a wild hunter.
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_2_8=(The horse casually glances at you)
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_2_9=You can run but you can't hide. There is no way the Suzhou imperial office can protect you forever.
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_3_1=What happened to you?
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_3_10=Young Master Xue, please go home. I will be temporarily living in the Kuang Family Estate for a while. I do not have good health. Maybe I won't be able to move for much longer. Currently, my only wish is to be able to meet Young Master Ke one more time.
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_3_2=You!
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_3_3=Don't worry, there are many people besides the Yanxing Escort Agency that what to act. Some things are better to not know about. Beware of your little mind not being able to let go!
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_3_4=You! What do you want?!
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_3_5=Very well, you wait and see. You want to see Ke Jun? Let me tell you, you will never see him!
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_3_6=Meng Xue, please go back.
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_3_7=Girl, you look so beautiful, but in reality, you are hard and you smell bad!
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_3_8=Young Master Xue, I am not afraid to die. I just want to see Young Master Xue face to face, even if it is the last time.
info_qy_luxia_luxia_talk_3_9=What do you see in the guy!? Do you really want to hang yourself on that dead tree? I have money and can help cure you of your illness, allowing you to live in good health.

info_qy_luxia_normal_info_8=Oh, I just saw him at the Ancient Forest. You can go find him there.
info_qy_luxia_normal_info_9=Oh, I just saw him at the Evil Bandit Fortress. You can go find him there.
info_qy_luxia_normal_player_0=Excuse me, do you know where to find a swordsman named Ke Jun?
info_qy_luxia_ouyang_talk_1_1=Ms. Lu is a very important part of their plan. Be careful with her. Be sure not to upset the plan.
info_qy_luxia_ouyang_talk_1_10=Boss, that Xia Lu girl is indeed very difficult to deal with.
info_qy_luxia_ouyang_talk_1_2=I hear that Ms. Lu is sick and the boy has gone to Yanyu Villa to collect medicine. When he comes back, he will see Ms. Lu in my bed looking like a whore...
info_qy_luxia_ouyang_talk_1_3=This guy Ke Jun, he is good at martial arts and he is rather famous. His only issue is that he is too conventional. The Jianghu needs change. I invited him to participate in such an important event out of kindness. He, however, did not respond to my kind gesture but would rather I be mean to him. His attitude has dragged Ms. Lu into matters that originally weren't her business.
info_qy_luxia_ouyang_talk_1_4=Rest assured, there are many beautiful women in the world. I am not as dumb as that Ke Jun fellow.
info_qy_luxia_ouyang_talk_1_5=Nonsense, with their means, the really do not need to deceive us. They are just trying to use Ms. Lu' illness to make Ke Jun do what they want. We got paid already, so we must complete our tasks. Even if Ms. Lu is not of use anymore, you still need to be careful. We do not want to anger those masters.
info_qy_luxia_ouyang_talk_1_6=Yes... Yes. However, I am a little worried. Ever since they poisoned her, Xia Lu has been severely injured. If they are not able to fully cure her in the future, how will I marry her?
info_qy_luxia_ouyang_talk_1_7=Be quiet! Hey stupid, don't be so loud. If you let someone else find out, we will all be in trouble!
info_qy_luxia_ouyang_talk_1_8=Being good at martial arts may not be a good thing. Take Ke Jun for example. Had he had not had such good martial arts skills, he would not have crossed the Blade Sharpening Hall.
info_qy_luxia_ouyang_talk_1_9=Huh, you don't look like much of a man. A few years earlier, if you were willing to work hard and defeat Ke Jun, would still be ours.
info_qy_luxia_player_be_found=Is this the Tong-Fu Inn? Sorry master, I went the wrong way.

sys_clone031_062=All of the Hell King's accomplices have been eliminated. The Hell King's forces have been greatly weakened. It is likely that the Hell King's secret room (125,394) is hidden inside the Residence of Leisure. Let's find out.
sys_clone031_063=Did you hear that? So the entrance of the Hell King's secret room is inside. <font color="#ffff00">It's at (114, 370)!</font>
sys_clone031_064=You trouble makers! I'll make you pay, all of you!
sys_clone031_065=The Hell King's secret room:
sys_clone031_066=Can't imagine such a big secret room is hidden underneath the Residence of Leisure. Now go down the hallway and find the Hell King!
sys_clone031_067=The Hell King's secret room is right in front of me! However, I am stopped by this big gate! The  entrance is where you can find the Hell King's ledger. Getting the ledger will allow me to rule the Central Plains!
sys_clone031_068=How can I open this gate? Is this a trap?
sys_clone031_069=Who are you? How dare you sneak up on me? Take 'em down!
sys_clone031_071=All right. Let's go.
sys_clone031_073=Time Limit:

sys_clone031_077=Pirate captain:
sys_clone031_078=There are many pirate captains in Golden Sand Bay. Eliminate them quickly to lower their morale. <font color="#ff0000"> Let's mount the condor raised by the Beast Villa disciple at (-499,16), take the explosives nearby, and bombard the pirate captains. </font>

sys_clone031_095=The <font color="#ff0000">Whistle</font> is now at your disposal. Use it to summon the condor!
sys_clone031_096=There are many pirates on the Golden Sand Bay. If you run out of explosive, return to (-459, 9) of the wharf for more.
sys_clone031_097=All people who ever came to the Delightful Island were finally controlled by the Hell King. They lost their self-respect, and had nothing to fight for. Since pirates are attacking the Isle, it would be a great opportunity for us to crush the Hell King's forces! I know how to get to him.
sys_clone031_098=Unite with Li Zhong:
sys_clone031_099=Li Zhong went to the Delightful Villa in advance, meet him outside the Delightful Villa at (-146,596).
sys_clone031_100=Proceed to the Tender Land:
sys_clone031_102=You think you can overthrow the Hell King?
sys_clone031_103=An ant dreams of biting an elephant to death. How hilarious!
sys_clone031_104=You can't even get rid of the bunch of ants. Looks like I have to do it for myself. Die!

sys_clone031_108=Many pirates are besieging Delightful Island. <font color="#ffff00">Liu Yun (-448, 1)</font> is resisting with his men. Find him quickly to lend him assistance.
sys_clone031_109=Delightful Island Crisis:
sys_clone031_110=The stone gate is opening slowly! Enter the Hall and find the Hell King!!
sys_clone031_111=Find the Hell King:

sys_clone033_304=I don't quite understand what you said, Brother Zhuo.
sys_clone033_305=Those are crocodile tears you're shedding. I thought you'd be pleased.
sys_clone033_306=Brother Zhuo, you were born outside imperial territory, but you claim the Central Plains as your homeland. It's quite clear that you have the ambition to take over the country.
sys_clone033_307=While all of you here had fought your numerous battles, I was still a nobody. Your Majesty, if it hadn't been for your goodwill, I would never be able to come so far. Even if my skills are not worthy, at least they could provide us with some amusment.
sys_clone033_308=No need for such modesty, Brother Zhuo. By nature and tradition, the strong dominate the weak. Seeing others dying is more agreeable than seeing yourself dying.
sys_clone033_309=Brother Zhuo, you are wasting your time selling your lies before the emperor. The emperor fully trusts me, otherwise I wouldn't have been appointed a position of great responsibility.
sys_clone033_310=Don't overreact, Brother Zhuo, I'm nobody and my name is too trivial to be remembered. A duel between great masters is always a matter of life and death. When the duel is over, if you still want to know the truth, I would be happy to tell you.
sys_clone033_311=What's the matter, Brother Zhuo? Not enough Chi? Ha ha ha…
sys_clone033_312=It's too late!
sys_clone033_313=What are you talking about? Enough of your slanders!
sys_clone033_314=Shut your mouth!
sys_clone033_315=Brother Zhuo, if you're getting tired of living, I won't hesitate to lend you my sword.
sys_clone033_316=I haven't been in Central Plains for a long time. I was quite surprised that you are so strong. "Wo Weihuang" is a rebellious name, I bet it's not your real name. So your real name, please?
sys_clone033_317=Your candor pleases me, Young Hall Leader. You deserve my mercy.
sys_clone033_318=You asked for it!
sys_clone033_319=Hmph! Half a year ago, Ding Jiuzhong was killed, Tao Baisui was nowhere to be found, and now the jade treasure appeared, and the Ten Ultimates showed up. The world is in upheaval you are the one behind it! Will you now tell me, what's the purpose of this brilliant conspiracy?
sys_clone033_320=The Ten Ultimates have retired from Jianghu for a very long time. You made them show up and fight against each other. Some of them are dead while other wounded. Such a tale!
sys_clone033_321=You had everybody fooled. Your ambition impresses me, Young Hall Leader.
sys_clone033_322=Young Hall Leader, you've masked your skills well. For all my years in Jianghu, I still cannot figure out where you learned to fight like that.
sys_clone033_323=Perhaps it'd be not so bad to die at the hands of such a worthy adversary as you, Young Hall Leader.
sys_clone033_324=You are the son of the emperor in name only. Your claim to the throne will be challenged as long as Zhu Di's other sons live. We are the Wala…why don't you join us for profit and glory? Surely if the next emperor is unfit to rule, we'd find a suitable replacement!
sys_clone033_325=You are young and naive. You need to see this - one of my ultimate skills!
sys_clone033_326=I recognize this skill…and you! It's you who gave Mo Wuqing to us and poisoned her!
sys_clone033_327=It's you who is behind all this! Not only you knew in advance that the East Chamber were plotting a rebellion, but you also knew about my plan to kidnap the emperor, which explains why you gave Mo Wuqing to us!
sys_clone033_328=Bravo, such a brilliant conspiracy! How long did it take you to execute your plan? I bet it was very difficult to find Ming Shiyue and Yu's descendents…
sys_clone033_329=It turns out that I'm just a pawn after so many years of conspiracy, fooled to the very end! Now that all is said and done, go ahead and strike me. Let's get this over with.
sys_clone033_330=You are such a handsome young man, with such delicate skin. Should I even lay my rough hands on it?
sys_clone033_331=Hmph! Three years ago you fled rather quickly. The insect poison had no antidote, and I thought you died somewhere in a filthy part of town. Never thought that you would get over it using the Nirvana skill. Today I will let you taste my little brothers...
sys_clone033_334=Ha! I've lived a hundred years, and I'm too old to understand what you just said. Could you repeat that? No matter what, bear in mind that Zhuo and Wo Weihuang are unimaginably powerful, and I'm a weak old man, so what do you expect me to do about it?
sys_clone033_335=Seems you are having itchy hands and sore eyes, correct? Ha ha, I've poisoned you. Leave me. Your life is already mine, and I choose to spare it, for now.
sys_clone033_336=Leave now, or you'll see me in a different state. You won't like that.
sys_clone033_337=Young man, why do you insist on fighting? Don't you understand the tradition of respecting the old?

sys_clone033_347=What made you conspire with Zhuo Bei against the emperor? Did they force you to do so?
sys_clone033_348=No matter what happened, I won't hold you responsible as long as you turn yourself around now...
sys_clone033_349=Did nothing in our past ever mean anything to you? Why are you treating me this way?
sys_clone033_350=Qing'er!
sys_clone033_351=Qing'er, wake up! Don't you remember me?
sys_clone033_352=So, our relationship…it was but a dream. Very well, you may strike me now.
sys_clone033_353=(The horse casually glances at you)
sys_clone033_354=…Kill!

system_5n_txz54=Did you notice that there are a circle of pegs on the ground? Follow the hint (the hint would be invisible if you set the visual effect to minimum). Move your character to the top of the wooden peg (9 stacks of the buff are mandatory, you have 5 chances for each round), and go to the prison gate guard. He will then open the door for you.

39096=Stop it!
39097=Dharmapala: How dare you disturb the palace leader!
39098=Dharmapala has been defeated. The trapped person has something to say to you.
39099=Dharmapala: You've slaughtered our people! I'll make you pay!

menu_newword_xiyu_loulan_1=Don't worry, they're safe with me.
menu_newword_xiyu_loulan_2=Sounds interesting. Tell me more.
menu_newword_xiyu_loulan_3=Sounds like a fair deal. Thank you.
title_newworld_xiyu_loulan_1=So they say you have the Desert Stars. Now every faction in the Western Regions will be after you.
title_newworld_xiyu_loulan_2=Now that you have a taste for the finest things in life, how would you like to have more treasure coming your way? The map of the fabulous Gold Centipede Cave is yours, if you give me the Desert Stars.
sys_xiyu_sg_1=This is the calm before the storm. A war is about to start!
sys_xiyu_sg_2=Time's up. Better luck next time!
sys_xiyu_sg_3=Congratulations, you've defeated the experts!

llmkdoor=Can't activate directly.
sys_llmk_talk_001=I am injured and in need of rest. Please help us rescue Yang Peifeng and the Wudang disciples. They are trapped in the left side of the Loulan Treasury.
sys_llmk_talk_002=Please get well. Leave the rest to me.
sys_llmk_talk_003=We're Emei. Our fight with Yin Feng and Lu Qianniang brought us here, and the stone gate closed behind us. I thought we'd never get out!
sys_llmk_talk_004=Be careful. Traps could be everywhere.
sys_llmk_talk_005=I wonder how Yang Peifeng and his team are doing, and how those sinister faction members just came out of nowhere…this is infuriating!
sys_llmk_talk_006=Focus on healing your wounds. I'll take care of what's left.
sys_llmk_talk_007=Did you see all those puppets? I found some kind of mechanical switch in one of them.
sys_llmk_talk_008=I will keep an eye open for it. That could be a trigger for more traps.
sys_llmk_talk_009=The mechanism in this room appears to be connected to the stone gate blocking the central chamber.
sys_llmk_talk_010=Let me go take a look.
sys_llmk_talk_011=If you hadn't arrived on time, it would have been a total disaster for us!
sys_llmk_talk_012=I was only doing what had to be done.
sys_llmk_talk_013=The fighting got so chaotic that we've lost track of each other. I noticed that Xu Miaozhen and the Emei Disciples were forced to retreat to the path on the right. They must be trapped by now. Please go save them!
sys_llmk_talk_014=Tend your wounds, Sir Yang. I'll take care of the rest.
sys_llmk_talk_015=I've juse become friends with those Emei. You must not let anything happen to them!
sys_llmk_talk_016=Don't worry, I'll make sure they're safe.
sys_llmk_talk_017=What a treacherous place! I fear for the safety of those Emei disciples.
sys_llmk_talk_018=Focus on healing your wounds. I'll take care of what's left.
sys_llmk_talk_019=See those wooden puppets on your way here? I wonder if they are the armored automatons I've heard about.
sys_llmk_talk_020=They are indeed, and quite powerful, too. There's no telling what is driving force behind them.
sys_llmk_talk_021=There's a stone gate blocking the central chamber. It appears to be connected to the mechanism in this room.
sys_llmk_talk_022=I'll go take a look.
sys_llmk_talk_023=Those Emei are true heroines. I hope they're safe.
sys_llmk_talk_024=Focus on healing your wounds. I'll take care of what's left.
sys_llmk_talk_025=Yang Peifeng and the Wudang disciples are trapped at the left side of the Luolan Treasury! Forgive me for not going with you to save them, for I must rest and treat my wounds.
sys_llmk_talk_026=I just came from Yang Peifeng and his team. Don't worry, they're safe now.
sys_llmk_talk_027=Wonderful news! Please continue with your valliant efforts…you're near the end! I leave the rest of our mission in Sir Yang's good hands, and yours.
sys_llmk_talk_027_1=I'll go talk to him now.
sys_llmk_talk_028=What do we do now? How do we open that stone gate?
sys_llmk_talk_029=I think we need to trigger some kind of mechanism.
sys_llmk_talk_030=Why are there so many mechanical devices in this place? Wooden automatons? It's simply beyond belief!
sys_llmk_talk_031=The ancient technology of this place is truly incredible. I'd never imagine such things were possible even in this day and age.
sys_llmk_talk_032=The rest of us are injured. It's all up to you now to complete our mission.
sys_llmk_talk_033=Focus on healing your wounds. I'll take care of what's left.
sys_llmk_talk_034=I'm glad that everyone is fine.
sys_llmk_talk_035=Focus on healing your wounds. I'll find a way.
sys_llmk_talk_036=There is a mechanical device of some kind in this room.
sys_llmk_talk_037=Watch your step. Let me go check it out first.
sys_llmk_talk_038=Are Sir Yang and his team all right?
sys_llmk_talk_039=Aside from minor injuries, everyone is fine. We've discovered that, in order to access the inner sanctum of the Luolan Treasury, the mechanisms at two adjoining chambers must be activated at the same time.
sys_llmk_talk_040=If we can figure this out, then so can our enemies. We don't have much time left.
sys_llmk_talk_040_1=I'm sure there is still much any of us has yet to discover.
sys_llmk_talk_041=We're all counting on you now.
sys_llmk_talk_042=I won't disappoint you.
sys_llmk_talk_043=We'll come to your assistance as soon as we're recovered.
sys_llmk_talk_044=Thank you all!
sys_llmk_talk_045=Take care, hero!
sys_llmk_talk_046=Thank you.
sys_llmk_talk_047=Just now the two opposing sides were fighting each other so hard that we strayed. I noticed that Xu Miaozhen and Emei Disciples were forced to retreat to the aisle on the right. They must have been cornered and captured. Please save them!
sys_llmk_talk_048=The injuries they've sustained are minor. They'll recover soon.
sys_llmk_talk_049=I'm glad to hear that. Our next move is to open the stone gate that leads to the inner sanctum of the treasury. Its opening mechanism is connected to switches that can be found somewhere in the two adjoining chambers. If we find those switches, we'll be able to open the gate.
sys_llmk_talk_049_1=Good to know. I'll go check it out.
sys_llmk_talk_050=Those villains will not give up so easily. We must be prepared.
sys_llmk_talk_051=Agreed.
sys_llmk_talk_052=While we were fighting, our enemies mentioned something about mechanical triggers. They could be referring to traps or door switches in this area.
sys_llmk_talk_053=I'll go find those mechanical triggers.
sys_llmk_talk_054=Sir Yang is right. The stone gate's opening mechanism is connected to the two chambers at either side, where you'll find the switches. One switch is here in this chamber. The other switch should be where Lady Xu and the Emei disciples are.
sys_llmk_talk_055=Let me go take a look.
sys_llmk_talk_056=Take another look. The clue is nearby.
sys_llmk_talk_057=Not bad.
sys_llmk_talk_058=Watch your step. Don't trigger any traps.
sys_llmk_talk_059=I'll be careful.
sys_llmk_talk_060=Did you find them?
sys_llmk_talk_061=They're all slightly injured. They'll recover soon.
sys_llmk_talk_062=I'm relieved to hear that. Now we can focus on opening that stone gate.
sys_llmk_talk_063=Don't worry, we'll get it open.
sys_llmk_talk_064=It's all up to you now.
sys_llmk_talk_065=I won't disappoint you.
sys_llmk_talk_066=Take care!
sys_llmk_talk_067=Thank you.
sys_llmk_talk_068=This treasury is full of mystery and wonder. The Luolan people were indeed ahead of their time.
sys_llmk_talk_069=Not bad.
sys_llmk_100=It's moving!
sys_llmk_101=These puppets…they're coming to life!
sys_llmk_102=I'm hearing sounds of battle. Is anyone there? These wooden puppets look very peculiar…
sys_llmk_103=So, you have the key to the final door. That'll make things much easier.
sys_llmk_104=The treasure of Loulan must not be sullied by foreign hands!
sys_llmk_105=Enough talk. Fight!
talk_llmk_002=Noises of battle are coming from all directions. Who can it be?

title_newworld_xiyu_xixia_4=Because of the incompetence of Guan Fenglei of the Tiger Roaring Villa, Wang Xiao of the Royal Guard got his hand on a secret roster of the men who are fighting for our cause. My men are in danger!

sys_newworld_xiyu_xixia_1=So, even the righteous is not above stealing. Shame on you, ha ha!
sys_newworld_xiyu_xixia_2=Villain! I'll get you next time!
sys_newworld_xiyu_xixia_3=I must rest. We'll fight another day.
sys_newworld_xiyu_xixia_4=The Royal Guards are in battle. This is your chance to steal the roster from their leader.
sys_newworld_xiyu_xixia_5=Ha ha, that's all for today. I'm out of here.
39087=The Royal Guards over there are engaged in battle. I'll wait until an opportunity presents itself.
39088=I will come back for you
39089=Oh boy! We'll fight next time. I'm leaving.
39090=If I hadn't been badly injured, I would have easily defeated you.
39091=Various factions have joined the battle. Defeat them!
39092=These injuries mean nothing to me. I will still finish you!
39093=So, the righteous one is caught stealing? Shame on you.
sys_find_water_001=Congratuations, you have found a precious source of water in this vast and barren desert.

sys_djh_lf_04=That was some excellent kung fu you just demonstrated. May I have the pleasure of sparring with you, so that I may experience it firsthand?

speak_xiyu_damoguicheng_4=Do not dishonor the memory of our Shifu! We have an agreement!
speak_xiyu_damoguicheng_5=I simply entertained Mr Ling, and added some rare spice to his food. I'm afraid the only thing on his mind now is to seek revenge against Zhu Di. He will kill anybody in his way.
speak_xiyu_damoguicheng_6=So be it. From this day onward, you are no longer my daughter.
speak_xiyu_damoguicheng_7=So you found me, you vile woman. Aren't you afraid that you won't be able to crawl back into that cave of yours?
speak_xiyu_damoguicheng_8=You don't scare me. If it weren't for the imperial guards you brought to my home last time, you'd be holding my chamberpot by now.

speak_xiyu_damoguicheng_10=So this is your doing, Lei Xingkong! This is the end of you!

sys_bff_04=You will die by my hand today…this I swear!
sys_bff_05=I didn't show your mother the kindness she deserved. Now, even Shi Guanyin is my enemy. I don't blame you for hating me, but if you ever try to throw your life away again, you may just do that.
sys_bff_06=Save your regrets, villain. As long as I'm alive, you're as good as dead!
sys_bff_07=Lei Xingkong, there's no escape for you!

speak_beiyuan_cfbj_2=I was trying to help. There's no need to thank me.
speak_beiyuan_cfbj_3=I'm just glad I could help at all.
sys_beiyuan_cfbj_exit=Leave
text_cb_xss_title_01=You've made it this far. That says quite a lot about you.
text_cb_xss_01=I got lucky, that's all.
text_cb_xss_title_02=You're too modest! You think you can just barge into the Changbai Sect like that?
text_cb_xss_02=Yet here I stand, as your guest. It means that I may be of service to you.
text_cb_xss_title_03=You're a clever one, so I'll be completely honest with you. We're a small unit of the Changbai Sect. We were sent to the Northern Plains on a mission, but that was eight years ago. We've been stuck here ever since.
text_cb_xss_03=Tell me more. Perhaps I can help you.
text_cb_xss_title_04=Well, we should start with what happened eight years ago…
text_cb_xss_04=Who is that?
text_cb_yqq_title_01=So, now you know the Changbai Sect is not to be trifled with.
text_cb_yqq_01=Are you from Changbai Sect?
text_cb_yqq_title_02=Indeed. I'm here to visit Elder Xiang on behalf our leader. If it were not for the Blood Worm, I would never have come all the way to this frozen wasteland.
text_cb_yqq_02=Could you please take me to your people? There are a few things I need to ask, and I'd be grateful for your assistance.
text_cb_yqq_title_03=Of course. Just follow me.
text_cb_yqq_03=Thank you.
text_cb_jl_title_01=It's not safe here. Why don't you just go now?  When it gets dark, terrible things will happen, and you'll regret ever coming here.
text_cb_jl_01=You don't have to worry about me. I can take care of myself.
text_cb_jl_title_02=This is no joke. Leave before sunset! When night falls, members of the Changbai Sect will lose their minds and beat up anybody they see. Their blood is brownish. We have to lock them up in iron chains. Now that we have my young martial sister today, I'm afraid we won't have another stone house for you to hide inside! You really should go!
text_cb_jl_02=I find all this very hard to believe. Who would lose their minds like that?
text_cb_jl_title_03=All of them except my younger martial sister and me. It's been eight years since they were bitten by the Blood Worm…they wouldn't be able to last that long outside Snowy Mountain. Go now, before I make you leave.
text_cb_jl_03=I'll leave.
text_cb_jl_04=I'll stay.
text_cb_xy_title_11=Why are you following me? Who sent you?
text_cb_xy_14=I see.
text_cb_sw_title_01=Here is the stone house.
text_cb_sw_01=I'm going in.
text_cb_xy_title_01=What are you talking about? You know nothing!
text_cb_xy_01=You're already cured of the Blood Worm!
text_cb_xy_title_02=Nonsense. What made you say that?
text_cb_xy_02=Here. Look at the blood stains on the wall. You said someone who's inflicted with the  Blood Worm wouldn't bleed like this! The color should always be brownish!
text_cb_xy_03=You know quie well what's inside this sandalwood box. It's dim sum from Yanjing, a rare treat in these parts, still fresh from the oven. You must have traveled very recently to get this, which would not have been possible if you were still afflicted with the Blood Worm!
text_cb_xy_04=This is a drawing depicting Elder Xiang's madness at night. If you were also driven mad by the Blood Worm, would it have been possible for you to make this drawing?
text_cb_xy_05=You said alcohol is fatal to those afflicted with the Blood Worm. You're the only here with a jug of wine at your bedside. You even smell of drink!
text_cb_xy_title_03=You meddlesome fool!
text_cb_xy_title_04=Like I said, you're quite clever.
text_cb_xy_title_05=So? What of it?
text_cb_xy_title_06=So, you have the keen nose of a dog.
text_cb_xy_06=Why are you keeping the antidote to yourself?
text_cb_xy_07=Why aren't you sharing the antidote with your comrades?
text_cb_xy_08=But you still used the antidote. Where is it now?
text_cb_xy_09=You're lying. You must still have some left for the others. I need it.
text_cb_xy_title_07=Need I remind you, if I had the antidote, I would have used it to save my father.
text_cb_xy_10=So, he used all of the antidote on you, his own child.
text_cb_xy_title_08=Eight years ago, we of the Changbai Sect were compelled to carry out a mission, on behalf of the man who poisoned us with the Blood Worm. He then gave us just enough antidote to be free of the poison's mind-controlling effects for one month, and ordered us to carry out a second mission. We refused.
text_cb_xy_11=Please, I need to know what happened.
text_cb_xy_title_09=Let's just say that the same amount of antidote was a permanent cure of the Blood Worm…for just one person.
text_cb_xy_12=So that's how you were cured.
text_cb_xy_title_10=No, I speak the truth. The others believed my father took the antidote, which was also true, but he did not use it for himself.
text_cb_xy_13=Your father cared only about you, not himself or the others. I will not judge him.
text_cb_xss_05=Who's your master now?
text_cb_xss_title_06=No idea. Every time we meet, he's dressed in black all over, with a bamboo hat.
text_cb_xss_06=Which faction did he order you to destroy?
text_cb_xss_title_07=Ice Spirit Castle. We didn't expect Tian Xi, their leader's eldest daughter, would later join the Longmen Agency. We slaughtered her entire family. Most regrettable…
text_cb_xss_07=Leave that in the past. What's to become of you now?
text_cb_xss_title_08=Let me ask you this: were you the one who offered Blackpool Devil the antidote?
text_cb_xss_08=Why are you asking me about this?
text_cb_xss_09=Hundred Beads?
text_cb_xss_title_10=Half Moon is the poison that has inflicted him, and Hundred Beads are the only known antidote. He is afraid that once Hundred Beads are used as an antidote for the Blood Worm, they will no longer be effective against Half Moon.
text_cb_xss_10=Then it is indeed fate that has brought me to you. I have the Hundred Beads. They are yours, for but a small price.
text_cb_xss_title_11=Please say.
text_cb_xss_11=I need you to tell me everything you know about the massacre at the Ice Spirit Castle eight years ago.
text_cb_xss_title_12=Very well. What you heard from Ye'er was but half of the story. We were sent to a large house with many courtyards to prepare ourselves for an upcoming mission. Many masked servants were there to attend to our needs. Then a man wearing blood-soaked clothes came to lead us to Ice Spirit Castle.
text_cb_xss_12=Please continue.
text_cb_xss_title_13=When we were finally told of our mission's objective, we refused to cooperate. The blood-cloaked man then started to play his flute, which activated the Blood Worms, parasites that we unwittingly ingested with our food and drink. We were compelled to carry out the slaughter.
text_cb_xss_13=I see……
text_cb_xss_title_14=Yan'er, Ye'er's fiancée, died in the mission. Yi Zhi sees me as an enemy because he thinks I am the one who caused them all the trouble. Lend me your Hundred Beads, I beg you. I must make amends.
text_cb_xss_14=OK.
text_cb_xss_title_15=Thank you for saving my life. What's inside this white jade box is not the antodote, but something just as useful. It contains a Blood Worm larva preserved by Ye'er. The larva can be used to detect the presence of its queen, which is the source of the mind-controlling power.
text_cb_xss_15=This is what I've been looking for. Thank you!
text_cb2_jyz_title_01=You've found the Changbai Sect. State your business.
text_cb2_jyz_01=I've been looking for the Changbai Sect. It's just my luck that I found you so soon!
text_cb2_jyz_title_02=Why are you looking for us?
text_cb2_jyz_title_03=Then help me, and I will help you in return. I need your help in dealing with Elder Xiang. Will you do it? It's not a decision to be taken lightly, for your life may well be at stake.
text_cb2_jyz_03=Let me think about it.
text_cb2_jyz_title_04=So, what have you decided?
text_cb2_jyz_04=Helping you sounds risky. I don't want to lose my life over this.
text_cb2_jyz_05=I'm intrigued. I've come all the way here already, so what choice do I really have?
systalk_01=This can't be handled by any outsider. Are you sure you have the right person for the job?
systalk_02=Keep your opinion to yourself. I know what I'm doing.
systalk_03=Don't make any hasty decisions. We've waited eight years for this, so what's the hurry now? We must get rid of this person one way or another.
systalk_04=Enough. I've made up my mind.
text_cb2_jyz_title_05=But you've already learned too much. I'm afraid I can't let you leave now.
text_cb2_jyz_06=But no, whatever game you are playing, I refuse to be your pawn.
text_cb2_jyz_title_06=You know what you have to do.
text_cb2_jyz_title_07=Just give up and die!
text_cb2_jyz_07=Fine, let's fight!
text_cb2_jyz_08=Very well. I don't really want to fight you, anyway.
text_cb2_jyz_title_08=Relax. I only need you to get inside Xiang Ye's house. I'm looking for a piece of evidence to deal with his father.
text_cb2_jyz_09=Can you be more specific?
text_cb2_jyz_title_09=Let me tell you why we're here. For eight years, we've been inflicted with the Blood Worm, and only here in this land of ice and snow can we find respite.
text_cb2_jyz_10=Why do I have to be the one to break into Xiang Ye's house? You know Elder Xiang, I don't.
text_cb2_jl_title_01=So, what's your next move?
text_cb2_jl_05=Steal it without being caught.
text_cb2_jl_06=Grab it in plain sight.
text_cb2_jyz_title_11=Because it must be done at night, when we are all no longer ourselves. Know this: if you are afflicted with the Blood Worm, your blood will be brownish, just one sip of alcohol will kill you, and you can no longer leave Snowy Mountain. Do you get it now?
text_cb2_jyz_12=Very well.
text_cb2_sw_title_01=(The horse casually glances at you)
text_cb2_sw_01=I'll go back to Xiang Ye's house. He happens to be away at the moment.
text_cb2_sw_02=I'll keep following Xiang Ye to see what he's up to.
text_cb2_jyz_title_13=If you don't follow my instructions, you may as well just die now.
text_cb2_jyz_14=I've come across a few things. I believe some explanation is in order.
text_cb2_jyz_title_14=What have you found?
text_cb2_jyz_15=I saw some blood stains.
text_cb2_jyz_16=I found a sandalwood box.
text_cb2_jyz_17=There's an interesting drawing.
text_cb2_jyz_18=Didn't you say Blood Worm makes you allergic to alcohol?
text_cb2_jyz_title_15=What's so special about the blood stain?
text_cb2_jyz_title_16=What's inside the box?
text_cb2_jyz_title_17=That's not important. Anything else?
text_cb2_jyz_title_18=Is that so? And Meng Du can't see this for himself?
text_cb2_jyz_19=The blood stain had a normal red color. But you said those afflicted with the Blood Warm have brownish blood.
text_cb2_jyz_20=Fresh dim sum, all the way from Yanjing. Quite a rare treat around here, wouldn't you agree?
text_cb2_jyz_21=Hang on, you really need to take a look at the drawing. It's a rather accurate depiction of Elder Xiang in his frenzied state. Now who would be able to draw like that?
text_cb2_jyz_22=Xiang Ye's got quite a few wine jugs in his room. Who's supposed to drink it?
text_cb2_jyz_title_19=It appears someone is cured of the Blood Worm.
text_cb2_jyz_title_20=How dare they deceive me like this!
text_cb2_jyz_title_21=So I was right all along! Xiang Ye is cured of the poison! I will not let them get away with this!
text_cb2_jyz_title_22=It appears someone is cured of the Blood Worm.
text_cb2_jyz_23=Then why didn't you ask him for the antidote?
text_cb2_jyz_title_23=Eight years ago, Elder Xiang told us we were not given the antidote, and we've been exiled to the Northern Plains to this day. It pains me to learn that he has been lying to us all this time! I should have never joined the Changbai Sect!
text_cb2_jyz_24=Eight years ago, you say? What was the mission?
text_cb2_jyz_25=Then?
text_cb2_jyz_title_25=Before we knew the true nature of our mission, we were brought to a big house, ostensibly to prepare ourselves. There were servants to attend to our ever need, but we were not allowed to leave. We were not aware then that the man had poisoned our food with the Blood Worm.
text_cb2_jyz_26=How did you end up here, then?
text_cb2_jyz_title_26=As soon as a man draped in blood-soaked clothes played a flute, we were under his spell. He said he'd give us the antidote after we wiped out Ice Spirit Castle, and kept doing whatever he ordered.
text_cb2_jyz_27=What will you do now?
text_cb2_jyz_title_27=When our leader learned of his son's misdeed and of the treachery that befell us, he put his son to death. He's been looking for an antidote to this day, but to no avail. The only thing we know so far is that extreme cold will prevent us from dying outright, and that's why we're here.
text_cb2_jyz_28=I see……
text_cb2_jyz_title_28=I no longer care that I'm afflicted with the Blood Worm. What upsets me is the fact that the leaders of our sect had the antidote all this time, but would not share it with the rest of us!
text_cb2_jyz_29=Perhaps they kept the antidote from you for a reason.
text_cb2_xss_title_07=Yi Zhi, listen to me. The antidote we received, it could only give all of us temporary relief, but if it were to be used on one person alone, that person would be permanently cured. I admit it was wrong of me to give it to Ye'er.
text_cb2_xss_08=What are you suggesting?
text_cb2_xss_title_08=I am sorry for what I did, but now I know there is another antidote that can save us all. It's called the Hundred Beads, and they can be found in the Northern Plains.
text_cb2_xss_09=I happen to have some Hundred Beads with me.
text_cb2_jyz_title_29=Please, lend us the Hundred Beads. Free us of this affliction once and for all.
text_cb2_jyz_30=Getting my hands on the Hundred Beads wasn't easy. What's in it for me, if I let you have them?
text_cb2_jyz_title_30=What do you want?
text_cb2_jyz_31=Not a problem. But first, tell me: who was this man who ordered you to wipe out Ice Spirit Castle?
text_cb2_jyz_title_31=We don't know. All I can say is, the man in the blood-soaked clothes was obviously no stranger to murder and mayhem.
text_cb2_jyz_32=Who else was involved in the massacre?
text_cb2_jyz_title_32=I don't know. They were all masked, but they wielded many different weapons and practiced every kind of martial arts known. It's safe to say they're sinister and evil.
text_cb2_jyz_33=I'll lend you the Hundred Beads, in exchange for a live sample of the Blood Worm.
text_cb2_jyz_title_33=This White Jade Box contains the preserved larva of a Blood Worm. Use it to detect the queen of the brood or, if you have the means, raise it to produce parasites of your own.
text_cb2_jyz_34=Thank you.
text_fhxt_title_01=You must be here to enjoy the snow. You seem to be in a very good mood today.
text_fhxt_01=What if I'm here for you instead?
text_fhxt_title_02=What would you possibly want from a humble monk like me?
text_fhxt_02=There are many things a useful monk like you can tell me.
text_fhxt_title_03=The only useful thing I can say to you is a prayer for your health and well-being.
text_fhxt_03=Don't be so modest. I know you can do more than that.
sys_km_talk_1=Thank you. Let me send you on your way!
sys_km_talk_2=What the…
text_fhxt_title_04=Oh, so you know.
text_fhxt_04=You're carrying the portrait of a beautiful woman. That's not something a proper monk would do.
text_fhxt_title_05=Mind your words. The woman in the painting is Lady Qin, when she was young.
text_fhxt_05=You may as well just tell me the whole truth. A monk shouldn't lie, lest there be consequences here and in the afterlife.
text_fhxt_title_06=There's no need to intimidate me. If you ever learn what is not meant for you to know, it is you who shall find no rest until you die a sudden and brutal death. Also, I'll take that item you have in your hand. Give it some thought.
text_fhxt_06=I'm here in the Northern Plains to get rich. If I die, that would defeat the purpose.
text_fhxt_09=Go on, say what you have to say. I can handle it.
text_fhxt_title_07=Very well, then I bid you farewell.
text_fhxt_07=Is that so? And Meng Du can't see this for himself?
text_fhxt_title_09=The real Lady Qin has been gone from the lord's residence for at least ten years. In this portrait, her right hand has six fingers, and the portrait bears the official seal of an imperial court painter. It is the definitive means of identifying her remains. I'm telling you all this to get you in on this deal. You see, Lord Qin is framing Tian Xi for Lady Qin's murder. I'll get Tian Xi for him, in exchange for an ancient manual, but I don't want to deal with him directly. Here is where you can come in.
text_fhxt_10=I see. What's in it for me?
text_fhxt_title_10=The knowledge written in the ancient manual is for us to share. Take this painting to Lord Qin as proof of our intent. Ask him for the ancient script. I can trust you with it.
text_fhxt_11=Fine, give me the painting. (This is a key piece of evidence.)
text_fhxt_title_08=My information is not free. You'll have do something for me.
text_fhxt_08=OK.

sys_gmzd_ycr_002=I don't know what you're talking about. I am simply lost, and my only wish is to leave this hellish place!
sys_gmzd_ycr_003=You think I'm so stupid as to believe you? Go find me the murderer, or you'll never get out of here!
sys_gmzd_ycr_004=Um……
sys_gmzd_ycr_005=Do whatever you want, but I'm the only one who knows the way out.
sys_gmzd_ycr_006=Very well, I'll do as you say.
sys_gmzd_lx_001=So you're the one claiming to have stumbled your way here. We're looking for our elder martial sister Li Yanshaung. Long story short, she was saved in battle by our Shifu, and in gratitude she became her disciple. Our Shifu and Lu Wuming have been lovers for quite some time, but since she wouldn't bring him to the Ancient Tomb, they've made a home for themselves here.
sys_gmzd_lx_002=I see.
sys_gmzd_ly_001=We knew that Li Yanshaung also had feelings for Lu Wuming. We weren't sure if our Shifu knew about this, so none of us ever mentioned it to her.
sys_gmzd_ly_002=I see.
sys_gmzd_mr_001=Stop! Are you looking for Li Yanshuang? I just saw her sneaking past the sword monument. If you want her, then go!
sys_gmzd_mr_002=Thank you for the tip!
sys_gmzd_ycr_007=So, did you find the murderer?
sys_gmzd_ycr_008=Li Yanshuang did it, that's for sure. She said she was just trying to intimidate Lu Wuming, but it was he who held onto her sword and impaled himself. Now she wants you to clear the path to the exit, or she'll blow up the entire Ancient Tomb. If you don't believe me, I can find the explosives she has buried.
sys_gmzd_ycr_009=I can't believe she would do that! I won't allow it! Fine, here's my part of the bargain. Go to the cave where several coffins are kept. One of them leads to a secret exit.
sys_gmzd_ycr_010=Thank you. Please tell your people to leave as well.
sys_gmzd_ycr_011=Jump down there and you're free to go. Before you do, may I ask if that is the Ghost Mask you are carrying? That item and I share a long history. I'd like to trade my White Jade Hairpin for it.
sys_gmzd_ycr_012=Very well. I don't know what to do with this mask, anyway.
sys_gmxd_lys_001=Lu Wuming killed himself; I had nothing to do with it. That wicked Yang Chirui has just sealed the exit to have me dead.
sys_gmxd_lys_002=I have no intention of getting involved in your private affairs. My only wish is to leave this place.
sys_gmxd_lys_003=If I die, I want her to die with me. I've already buried the explosives. I know there's a secret path. Tell her to clear the path, or I'll blow this whole place.
sys_gmxd_lys_004=Very well.
sys_gmxd_lys_005=Go, or die here with the rest of us!
sys_gmxd_lys_006=Very well.
sys_gmxd_lx_001=So you're the one claiming to have stumbled your way here. We're looking for our elder martial sister Li Yanshaung. Long story short, she was saved in battle by our Shifu, and in gratitude she became her disciple. Our Shifu and Lu Wuming have been lovers for quite some time, but since she wouldn't bring him to the Ancient Tomb, they've made a home for themselves here. We knew that Li Yanshaung also had feelings for Lu Wuming. We weren't sure if our Shifu knew about this, so none of us ever mentioned it to her.
sys_gmxd_lx_002=It is actually like this.
sys_gmxd_ly_001=While cleaning our Shifu's room, I came upon a map of the Ancient Tomb. It shows there's a secret path in the deepest cave that keeps several coffins. Perhaps…
sys_gmxd_ly_002=Thank you!
sys_gmxd_lys_007=So, the secret path is here. Let that wicked woman lie down for a while longer…hmm, I see you have the Ghost Mask. Would you like to make a trade for my White Jade Hairpin?

sys_gmxd_lys_008=OK. I've no idea what is this mask for after all.

sys_sldxc_001=I caught a couple of Loulan descendents from Sandstorm Town. They must know the secrets of the Loulan Treasure. We must make them talk!
sys_sldxc_002=I know.
sys_sldxc_003=I know what you want. You're not going to get it from me, so do your worst.
sys_sldxc_004=Shi Guanyin won't let you go if you don't cooperate.
sys_sldxc_005=Come on, don't be like that. If you tell me what you know, I promise nothing will happen to you.
sys_sldxc_006=Ha ha, you're such an obedient pet of that witch. Go bark at someone else.
sys_sldxc_007=Mind your place. I'm not the one who's all tied up here.
sys_sldxc_008=You think working for Shi Guanyin will do you any good? Why don't you just untie me, and we'll have a fair fight. If you win, I'll let you have the treasure map.
sys_sldxc_009=Sure, why not. That'll just make things easier for the both of us.
sys_sldxc_010=You're tougher than you look! I yield. Here, this is what you want.
sys_sldxc_011=I'll take that, thank you.
sys_sldxc_012=What are you going to do to me?
sys_sldxc_013=Tell me what you know about the treasure map, or I'll kill you.
sys_sldxc_014=Tell me what you know about the treasure map. If you do, Shi Guanyin will reward you with so much money, you'll never have to go begging in the street again.
sys_sldxc_015=I know nothing! I'm just a beggar!
sys_sldxc_016=You think you're so tough?
sys_sldxc_017=I'm just a simple beggar. What do I know about treasure?
sys_sldxc_018=Then be a beggar for the rest of your miserable life!
sys_sldxc_019=Shi Guanyin sent you to interrogate us? You don't look the type for this dirty work.
sys_sldxc_020=I'm here to make things easy for you. If you don't cooperate now, you'll have to face Shi Guanyin herself, and by then you'll wish you didn't have to.
sys_sldxc_021=It just looks that way. I can let you two go right now, but only if you tell me the secret.
sys_sldxc_022=I've had my share of adventures. I'm not afraid of you.
sys_sldxc_023=That's what they all say. Let's see how long you can really last!
sys_sldxc_024=Untie me, and we'll have a fair fight. If you lose, it means there's no way you can really keep us here. If you win, I'll tell you whatever you want to know.
sys_sldxc_025=Fine by me.
sys_sldxc_026=Ha ha, I just wanted to stretch my arms and legs again, after being tied up like that. The fact is, even I do know anything about the treasure map, I still wouldn't tell you a thing!
sys_sldxc_027=Go to hell.
sys_sldxc_028=Go ahead, kill me. I'm not telling you a thing!
sys_sldxc_029=Kill you? I'm not done with you yet…tell you what, I'll kill this little beggar first. I don't think he knows anything, so it won't matter if he dies.
sys_sldxc_030=Don't…please don't kill him. Promise me not to hurt him, and I'll give you the treasure map.
sys_sldxc_031=Now that's more like it. Give me the map, and I won't hurt him. You have my word.
sys_sldxc_032=Wow.
sys_sldxc_033=If you don't tell me what you know, you'll be a slave here for the rest of your life!
sys_sldxc_034=Why don't you just tell me about the treasure? I'll share everything we find, wouldn't that be nice?
sys_sldxc_035=You underestimated the courage of a Loulan descendent. Save your breath.
sys_sldxc_036=Keep it up all you want. Sooner or later, you'll talk.
sys_sldxc_037=The treasure of Loulan must not be sullied by foreign hands!
sys_sldxc_038=You're really trying my patience!
sys_sldxc_039=Sounds of battle are coming from the outside. Who is it?
sys_sldxc_040=My mother died because you took Lei Xinkong away from her. Now I will make you pay!
sys_sldxc_041=You must be joking.
sys_sldxc_042=Die! All of you!
sys_sldxc_043=You're injured. You should get your wound treated, and then some rest.
sys_sldxc_044=Fools. Men are but playthings. Fine, give me the Desert Stars treasure map fragment, and I'll give you what you want.
sys_sldxc_045=As you wish. (Leave secret area.)
sys_sldxc_046=Exchange quest item.
sys_sldxc_047=Leave.
sys_newzb_xl=This equipment cannot be repaired. Its durability will be restored to normal when you transfer it to the new world.

39103=The stone gate in front is already open.
sys_beiyuan_ssg_001=Who dares to intrude in Divine Water Palace?!
task_newworld_beiyuan_ssg_011=You must have really impressed the palace leader. Fine, show me what you've got.  Let's see if it proves Tian Xi's innocence!
title_ssg_dl_001=If you help us clear Tian Xi's name, We of the Changfeng Escort Agency shall keep our word and give you the Ancient Manual. If not, don't waste our time.
title_ssg_dl_001_1=Lady Mo? What evidence do you have?
menu_ssg_dl_001_2=I got this Arrow of Gratitude from Yuan Shiping, better known as the Snowy Mountain Wanderer. He was Lady Mo's longtime companion, and thus could identify her remains.
title_ssg_dl_001_2=So what is Lord Qin up to? What is he after?
title_ssg_dl_001a=What about the map?
menu_ssg_dl_002=The map was incribed as a tattoo onto a piece of human skin. Somehow, it fell into the hands of the East Chamber eunuchs.
title_ssg_dl_002=This is all very hard to believe. Who helped Tian Xi escape to the Northern Plains?
menu_ssg_dl_002_1=I don't know. In any case, you promised a reward simply for the proof of Tian Xi's innocence in the alleged murder of Lady Qin; there was no mention of exposing an eight-year-old conspiracy. Now that things have gotten this far, we must spread the word concerning the Arrow of Gratitude. That may convince Miss Tian Xi to return to the Changfeng Agency.
title_ssg_dl_002_1=Good point. Tian Xi once said she needed the Arrow of Gratitude. That should help her case.
menu_ssg_dl_002_2=This whole situation is rapidly spinning out of control. Many factions are now gathering at the Northern Plains in search of treasure. Should the Changfeng Agency seek the Divine Water Palace as an ally, perhaps you will have a better grasp of things.
title_ssg_dl_002_2=That is for us to decide. For now, you've earned your reward for proving Tian Xi's innocence. We'll discuss the other matters at a later time.
menu_ssg_dl_002a=It's been a pleasure doing business with you. Farewell.
title_ssg_dl_002a=
task_newworld_beiyuan_ssg_012=You captured Tian Xi?
menu_ssg_qw_001=Allow me to be frank, my lord. There is a monk called Kong Ming. He has a portrait of a beautiful woman that you'll surely recognize, which is why it is sought after by Tian Xi. You can see where I'm going with this.
title_ssg_qw_001=Go on.
menu_ssg_qw_001_1=Kong Ming has Tian Xi. If you go to him with this portrait, he will turn Tian Xi over to you, no questions asked. That said, I am here only to acquire the ancient manual as my part of the deal. Whatever happens to Tian Xi is none of my concern; I am strictly a neutral party.
title_ssg_qw_001_1=Are you swearing loyalty to me, or making a threat?
menu_ssg_qw_001_2=I leave the matter in your hands, my lord.
title_ssg_qw_001_2=Ha ha, you've got some nerves, to bring this matter before me!
menu_ssg_qw_001a=You've misunderstood me, my lord.
title_ssg_qw_001a=Did I? I know you're here because of Tian Xi. You think you know something that can be used as leverage against me. Are you really that ambitious?
menu_ssg_qw_002=No, my lord! I have no such whatsoever…
title_ssg_qw_002=Then you disappoint me. Get out, or I'll have your headless body fed to the wolves!
menu_ssg_qw_002_1=Well.
title_ssg_qw_002_1=
menu_ssg_qw_001b=To swear my loyalty, of course. It is my great honor to serve you.
title_ssg_qw_001b=If you have something to say to me, out with it.
title_ssg_qw_003=You seem to know a little too much for your own good. Now THAT is a threat.
menu_ssg_qw_003_1=Yes, I fear for my own life. So much so, I've already told many others what I've just told you. If they don't see me leaving here alive with the ancient manual, they'll begin to think twice about this whole affair.
title_ssg_qw_003_1=So, you are making a threat.
menu_ssg_qw_003_2=I am here to serve you, my lord. I'll have to stay alive in order to do that.
title_ssg_qw_003_2=You have me at an disadvantage. So be it, then. Give me that painting of yours.
menu_ssg_qw_006=Of course, my lord. This way, please.
title_ssg_qw_006=Do not meddle in matters that do not concern you. Don't ever cross me again.
menu_ssg_qw_007=I understand, my lord.
menu_ssg_sj_001=Thank you for agreeing to see me, Palace Leader.
menu_ssg_sj_001_1=Very well. I'm here to speak of the murder case at Lord Qin's residence, and how it is connected to the extermination of Ice Spirit Castle eight years ago. This conspiracy is finally coming to light.
menu_ssg_sj_002a=You don't have to pretend to sound so surprised. If I am to be of use to you, you need to trust me with everything you know.
menu_ssg_sj_002b=Surely you know by now that factions of all kinds are coming to the Northern Plains. This is becoming a situation beyond any single person's control.
menu_ssg_sj_003=I was trying to be helpful. If you can't trust me, then I'll take my leave of you.
menu_ssg_sj_004=Hidden treasure? This is beginning to make sense…
menu_ssg_sj_005=Thank you…what is it?
menu_ssg_sj_006=OK.
title_ssg_sj_001=Let's dispense with the pleasantries. We all know why you're here.
title_ssg_sj_001_1=So, you're beginning to see the whole picture. I'll be the first one to admit that, for these past eight years, the Divine Water Palace is but a pawn in Lord Qin's scheme.
title_ssg_sj_001_2=Even Kong Ming…I never expected that he would be involved.
title_ssg_sj_002a=You presumptuous fool! If you dare to challenge me, I will crush you with the full might of the Divine Water Palace!
title_ssg_sj_002b=So it has come to this. Very well, I can tell you the old Lady Qin was not the one who was killed, but you already know that. Most of these factions coming to the Northern Plains are here on unfinished business. Just as what they did to Ice Spirit Castle eight years ago, they'll destroy anyone who knows the secret of their hidden treasure.
title_ssg_sj_003=Be gone, then. You know your way out.
title_ssg_sj_004=Yes, they're coming. Here, take this, it may help you. What you do with it is up to you.
title_ssg_sj_005=Some call it "Endless Love Fragrance." Use it for its pleasant scent, or as a valuable item for barter. If you are going to expose this eight-year conspiracy, you'll need all the help you can get.
title_ssg_sj_006=They'll be here soon. Go now, you know your way out.
ui_addschool_study_job=Please learn an appropriate life skill first.
sys_llhr_04=Various factions have arrived to assist.

sys_jxh_bgym_ts=Can't pick up the item. Bag is too full.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_01=No, I haven't seen him.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_02=What's happening to your face? You're growing old!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_03=I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't help you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_03_1=Very well, I'll find your sister.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_04=I'm sorry.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_05=I dealt with the Six Gates sect.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_06=All of a sudden, your sister started to grow old. It was horrible!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_07=How can you be so calm? Your sister is in trouble!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_08=Very well then, it's your call. Farewell.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_08_1=My conscience demands action. The girl needs my help.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_09=Er.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_10=Show some sympathy. It's your sister.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_11=So, you're worried that I may find something in this stone house.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_1=I've got evidence concerning Bai Shaoxie. It is proof that you've been planning to kill him all along!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_1_1=Just admit it. You don't want your sister to marry Bai Shaoxie. So you're going to kill him.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_1_2=The flower contains a toxin. You're responsible for your sister's unnatural aging!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_1_3=You're the one who caused all the trouble. I'm merely pointing out the truth, that you've been controlling her all this time! You're killing her!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_1_4=There are several dents on the sword. They were caused by internal energy in combat. If you really have never left Snowy Mountain, why would you make a simple sparring match with your sister look like a duel to the death?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_2=I'm not finished. You said you've never left the Snowy Mountain, then where did you get this flower?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_3=And you're a monster! How can you do this to your own sister?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_4=Your poor sister doesn't even know you're harming her! Have you ever seen this sword?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_13=What you've done to your own sister is unconscionable!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_14=If you really care about your sister, you would want her to be happy. Whether to marry someone or to stay with you, you should let her decide for herself.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_15=Very well, I'll be back.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_16=I convinced her to tell me the truth. Your sister poisoned you with the Essence of Caducity, to prevent Bai Shaoxie from marrying you. The aging effect is reversible, though, and the antidote is kept at its usual place.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_17=I feel sorry for both of you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_18=I wish you luck and happiness. Let me go speak to your sister now.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_22=She's leaving you to marry Bai Shaoxie.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_23=Don't be sad. Try to be happy for your sister. Maybe you'll find someone, too.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_23_1=Things change. I've heard bad things about this Bai Shaoxie. If things don't work out between them, I'm sure she'll come back to you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_24=I don't know. Maybe there's still time to give her a proper send-off.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_26=If she's to live a happy life, you can stop worrying. If she's unhappy, she knows she can always come back to you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_cn_27=Thank you.
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_01=Did you happen to see my man Bai Shaoxie on your way here?
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_02=He will get here on time to marry me. I'll be the most beautiful bride in the world. We'll live a happy life together…what is happening?
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_03=What's happening to me? My face! I can't marry Bai Lang like this! You must find my sister, she'll know what to do!
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_04=Don't go. Please help me…
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_05=Thank you.
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_06=What happened?
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_07=I see.
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_08=If he really has feelings for her, he wouldn't mind the way she looks. My sister and I have never left Snowy Mountain, and we've never seen anything like this. Perhaps it's fate, and there's really nothing we can do about it. You need not get any more involved in this.
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_09=So long.
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_10=Suit yourself.
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_11=Why are you still here? What are you looking for?
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_1=Nonsense. Just what do you think I'm trying to hide? What have you got against me?
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_1_1=That's ridiculous!
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_1_2=You, you're lying! How does this flower prove anything?
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_1_3=Who gives you the right to cause trouble between me and my sister? It's none of your business!
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_1_4=What's so special about this sword?
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_2=You have no right to talk to me like that. It's none of your business!
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_3=You meddlesome fool!
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_12_4=What goes on between me and my sister is none of your concern.
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_13=So what if I lied? I'm her sister and I will won't let her get married! No one can marry her! I'll kill anyone who gets close to her!
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_14=I did it with the best of intentions, to protect her from all the bad men out there. Mo-mo will always have me to keep her company here on Snowy Mountain.
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_15=Fine, let her decide. Since I already know how it will turn out, I may as well tell you. Yes, I poisoned her with the age-inducing Essence of Caducity, so that she would know whether a man would truly love her for who she is. She knows where I keep the antidote. Go, then come back and tell me of her decision.
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_16=What happened? What did my sister say to you?
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_17=It's just as I thought. I can't stand the fact that I must do everything she says, and she knows it. I gave my heart to Bai Shaoxie so that he can take me away from her, and start a new life.
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_18=I'm not the one you should feel sorry for. It's my sister. She loves no one, and no one loves her. I'll go get the antidote now, then leave with my beloved Bai.
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_22=So what has she decided?
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_23=I knew it. We've been sisters all our lives, and she would throw all that away for a man. It breaks my heart.
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_24=Lies! I'm not going to marry anyone. I will be my younger sister's guardian angel forever! Has she left?
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_26=You really think so?
title_newworld_beiyuan_cn_27=Very well, I'll wait for her. Here, take the Essence of Caducity. I won't be needing it again.

Afterwards Xie Qi abandoned the Mingyue, followed by the elder Wu Xiong of the faction to enter the Thousand Green Ravine to find the Cold Flame Flower treatment for the internal injuries, and at the same time assist Wu Xiong to find the Demon Ape in the mountain, and fight for the magical power left by the apostasy demon of Ming Cult.

After Mingyue received the news that the apostasy demon of the Ming Cult fled with the magic power, Wu Xiong took the initiative to suggest to the Headmaster to send someone to seize the Scripts. After being instructed by the leader, Wu Xiong led a large number of martial masters of Mingyue to Thousand Green Ravine.

Its forces swept through Wulin with the force of the prairie fire, and their influence for a while remained great. Although the Ming Cult congregation is broad, it has all kinds of people there. At that time, a dark master was hunted by many enemies because he hid a book of wicked evil. Later, he changed his name and entered Ming Cult. He secretly practiced dark arts, and he became possessed by the devil. After that, he had disputes with several cult members and seriously wounded them. Finally, the Ming Cult could not tolerate him anymore. After being besieged by the cult's masters, he escaped and disappeared into the mountains with Scripts. <br>It is rumored that a few years later a group of Ming Cult congregation accidentally went deep into the mountains and were attacked by a fierce giant ape. According to the survivors, this ape used the martial arts of the apostasy demon. In a short while the news spread rapidly. The former enemies of the apostasy demon in Jianghu and those who coveted the evil skills learned that the clues of the Scripts were hidden on the demon ape in the mountains, and went to look for it. One of the most mysterious foreign forces, Mingyue, even sent their martial masters to set camp in the surrounding mountains. After most of the Wulin people failed to find anything, they insisted on staying and looking for the Demon Ape. <br>Ming Cult and Mingyue camp for many years were only separated by the mountains. Although they had no contact with each other, they were alert of each other's existence. Today they found out about their ambitions and decided to strike the Ming Cult whenever there is a chance, and encroach it. Should Ming Cult ignore this, it will surely become the biggest hidden danger of the cult!

For this purpose, I specially called several training methods to restrain their Central Plains martial arts people and their young generations.

clone002n_hb004=Congratulations on becoming the leader! Alright, I am on my way.
clone002n_hb005=What should we do next? There are still many people in the Inn.
clone002n_hb006=It's worse to work for the East Chamber than being killed! Please find Zhou Zhian and bring me his head! Look for Yang Yuqian's two children while you're at it.

clone002n_hb008=Everything is done. It is time to find Shen Yishan.
clone002n_hb009=Sima Huifeng returned to Shen Yishan's place long ago. He must have been killed by them. I've just finished Laughing Madman's Task. I will do my business now. I will kill these animals to bury them with Sima brother. Go to kill Dong Qiu and Shen Yishan for me. I have encircled the hotel. Even a fly won't leave.

clone002n_hb018=Since there will be rewards, I'm up for it.

clone002n_smhf014=Is it that Zhou Zhian plans to travel out of the pass? They are doomed to meet us today. We wait brother He Biao, then we kill them all.
clone002n_smhf015=Don't blame on me if you get in trouble afterwards.
clone002n_smhf016=Shen Yishan also thinks there are too many people in the hotel today. I nearly can't hold it. Hurry to send signal to He Biao. Let him send people to circle the hotel, and hurry! Take the Signal Arrow. Go to a remote place to shoot it. Don't let other people see it.

sys_clone040_001=You not only received the secret letter, but also found this place. You are not an ordinary person. But, a straightforward person does not resort to insinuations. I am Lord Qin Manor's Zhu Yi.
sys_clone040_002=So you are a follower of Lord Qin. No wonder! You said this place has to do something with a mysterious clan and is likely to have great treasures. Please tell more.<font color="#ffff00">(Enter Gong Shuxuan Line)</font>
sys_clone040_003=For many years I have been looking for the mysterious clan and I have found this place, but I don't dare to enter.
sys_clone040_004=Indeed, this place is hidden deep here and there are significant human traces. But before we've met, there were obstacles.
sys_clone040_005=In my opinion, this place used to be the mysterious clan's stronghold. Even now there may be mysterious clan Martial Masters as in front (632,-220)... I invite you to explore with me.
sys_clone040_006=What you said is a bit too much. I'm here either for the mysterious clan or for the mysterious treasure. I'm not going to retreat! <font color="#ffff00">(Entering Gong Shuxuan Line, cannot change)</font>
sys_clone040_007=Recently I dare not go any further than this point. Be careful of what's in front!
sys_clone040_008=Finally got over it! That master's effort was anything but usual. This place indeed hides a secret!
sys_clone040_009=It looks slightly different from the Mystic Mo Family. But that is not important. I suppose you know where to go further.
sys_clone040_010=There is a bridge. Go there (131,78) and take a look!
sys_clone040_011=I didn't expect that there are people other than that blind man who know about this place. How could those little thieves divide grandpa's treasure!
sys_clone040_012=This person should be from the tomb robbers family, and his skill is great. He mentioned that this place has not only great treasures, but also Martial Masters looking for it!
sys_clone040_013=Not sure whether this place still holds the mysterious clan's secret.
sys_clone040_014=I put a lot of effort into this. I will share with you if I find any clues. I need your assistance!
sys_clone040_015=You are welcome. The terrain in front is very special. I wonder if you have any ideas.
sys_clone040_016=There are many strange rocks. Not sure what this rock is doing here, but someone has passed it before. Let's get (-183,-168) across first.
sys_clone040_017=This person suddenly started attacking me after I said I came from the Lord Qin Manor. Help me!
sys_clone040_018=I've finally convinced the tomb robbers to help me return to this place. Yet I got caught by the Lord Qin Manor. Sob...
sys_clone040_019=He killed himself... I don't know what grudges he had with me. Could he be from mysterious clan?..
sys_clone040_020=It probably is the blind man that the Tomb Burglar mentioned. That's weird.
sys_clone040_021=Proceed forward (173,-596) to find more information. Let's get going.
sys_clone040_022=What is this? Is it be the legendary Anaconda? I can't believe it really exists!
sys_clone040_023=Even though we are still shocked, people in front already reported that there is no further path to go!
sys_clone040_024=How could it be like this? There may be other dangers in here! Shouldn't we just return?!
sys_clone040_025=Hmm... To be honest, just now my guests found a secret passage (466,-609) above the rock. Where could it lead?..
sys_clone040_026=Please show us the way. I am interested what else this strange valley has prepared for us!
sys_clone040_027=Since you are already here. Come to me.
sys_clone040_029=Who are you? Is there really a mysterious clan altar in here?
sys_clone040_030=Mysterious clan, hahahaha... mysterious clan must have long forgotten Gong Shuxuan.
sys_clone040_031=Gongshu... Gongshu?!
sys_clone040_032=This is the tomb for you people, prepared by the mysterious clan. I am already old. Let's all die together!
sys_clone040_034=Alright, take me back there.
sys_clone040_035=After passing the challenge of the mechanical humanoid Wei Su, proceed ahead (131,78) to see what is there.
sys_clone040_036=It's said that terrain in front is special. Go over there (-183,-168) and have a look.
sys_clone040_037=As things get more and more complicated, even Zhu Yi doesn't know what's going on. Keep going ahead (173,-596).
sys_clone040_038=Enter the secret passage (466,-609) on the huge rock and see if there is a cave.
sys_clone040_039=After you went through the secret passage (466,-609), you heard the voice telling you to come over (510,-1128). Follow the magical voice.
sys_clone040_040=What do you want to know? Go die and figure it out in the hell!
sys_clone040_041=I am leaving. Anyone dares to stop me?
sys_clone040_042=By the end of the day, this is just some mortal form.
sys_clone040_043=The one who provided clues about mysterious clan turns out to be someone from the Lord Qin Manor? Lord Qin Manor is in middle of chaos. Does it have anything to do with the mysterious clan? Why should we trust you? <font color="#ffff00">(Enter Lord Qin Route)</font>
sys_clone040_044=Mysterious clan? To find out the truth and the purpose of this group, I've been ordered to search it for many years. Lord Qin Manor has nothing to do with the Association!
sys_clone040_045=(He seems sincere and we have numbers. Let's see what he got.) We will believe you for now. Do you have any clues about this place?
sys_clone040_046=After many years of research, I believe that this place used to be the mysterious clan's stronghold. Even to this day there may be mysterious clan Martial Masters. There can be even more evil things ahead. I invite you to explore this place with me.
sys_clone040_047=(He honestly mentioned that there will be danger ahead. He seems trustworthy.) Please lead the way. Let's go and see. <font color="#ffff00">(Enter Lord Qin Route, cannot change)</font>
sys_clone040_048=Li Qingkuang seems rather familiar with this place, while many of us get lost. What's going on with Tianwaitian Sect and mysterious clan?
sys_clone040_049=There seem to be more secrets buried in here than anyone could possibly imagine.
sys_clone040_050=Now we are certain that this place is unusual. There must be more dangers ahead. Are you still willing to accompany me?
sys_clone040_051=We are here to find the truth, so we are sure to proceed. The terrain ahead looks odd. It might be dangerous.
sys_clone040_052=There are many rocks. What is that strange rock for? Just now when we were looking for Li Qingkuang, someone has passed through the stone platforms. Perhaps it is safe. Let's head over and take a look.
sys_clone040_053=He killed himself... I don't know what grudges he had with me. Could he be from mysterious clan?..
sys_clone040_054=The blind man is rather suspicious. This is weird... I see that you are not evil. Of course there is nothing anomalous in your residence?
sys_clone040_055=I often came to mysterious clan, but there was nothing strange in my residence.
sys_clone040_056=I didn't trust you. Please forgive me. Let's move on.
sys_clone040_057=This beast has stitch marks on its back. I found this item after cutting the beast open...
sys_clone040_058=It this... a seal?
sys_clone040_059=This is a previous dynasty's treasure, Dragonjade Seal. It is a symbol to rule over the religions across the nation.
sys_clone040_060=Isn't it some kind of holy artifact? Why was it inside the body of this beast?
sys_clone040_061=No idea. I recognized it because I happened to read about it in the residence's book collection. This is an extraordinary item. I cannot trust anyone here. I will keep it for now. We will see how to deal with it once we leave this place.
sys_clone040_062=(He is sincere and is making a good point.) There are many outstanding people here. I don't think you will lose it. Please take care of it!
sys_clone040_063=There is something unusual ahead (510,-1128). I will follow the sound and see what is going on!

The Pyromaniacal Monk, who came from the Sky Wheel Temple from the foreign wulin, snuck into Shaolin. He accidentally encountered Hei Baizi, who was one of the six divine people. The Pyromaniacal Monk stimulated Hei Baizi for a duel, while he secretly poisoned Hei Baizi. Despite of being poisoned, Hei Baizi defeated the Pyromaniacal Monk easily. Hei Baizi even took the Sky Wheel Record for himself. The Sky Wheel Record presents a method to get Sky Wheel Bead. Taking the Sky Wheel Bead can unlock meridians. Such is very helpful to improve martial arts. Afterwards, under his niece Shui Wuxin's arrangement, Hei Baizi stayed in the underground palace of the Tai Lake. A few years later, Hei Baizi couldn't sustain the boredom there and moved to the Jiuyuan Walled City. He often lure jianghu experts to his place, with the fake attraction of rare treasure and martial arts. Though, in fact this was just to fulfill his desire for fighting. Nowadays, jianghu heroes all come here and want to have a try at dueling him.

She was tamed by the Elder Huadi as a flower slave with the "corpse" after playing dead because she was poisoned previously. Xiao Bieqing and Bi Liusu searched for many times and finally found Mu Shuzi. Unfortunately, Mu Shuzi was like a walking corpse. The two of them took her back to Scholars and visited the Famous Doctor to no avail. Dai Yushu, a successful doctor, said that there is only one person in the world who can detoxify it. Elder Huadi used to be the leader of Worm King Valley in the southwest. Rumor has it that there's a reclusive miraculous person in the Hidden King Peak of southern Shu, who excels in Miraculous Shield Armor, medical skills, insect skills, and eight trigrams. He is known as bloodthirsty doctor. And the bloodthirsty doctor's insect skill is far skillful than Elder Huadi. Because the bloodthirsty doctor lives in seclusion in the Hidden King Peak, and he is isolated, never comes out of the mountain, so few people know him. The Hidden King Peak is located in a tough spot. If you are not a local villager or a disciple of the bloodthirsty doctor, you have a large chance to die in the mountain.

There are also many heroes who are willing to help them and escort Mu Shuzi to the Hidden Peak.

ui_CloneStory945=<s><s>Five Elements Palace, Foreign Wulin's most fearsome and massive faction. Under the guidance of Person in Red, a thrilling trial is about to start. As the saying goes, beauty and money follow each other. The first palace of the Five Elements is filled with beautiful women and exotic treasures. If one's mind is affected by money and lust, they will end up in the hands of the brutal and murderous Jin Chaozi, and would not be able to return. Wood Springflower Palace, the second palace of the five elements, is a paradise where you can forget the worries of the world. The world is not aware of the dark currents underneath the peacefulness. If not for his skills, perhaps even Young Master Liu Ting would have been lost here. Flower fragrances flow and the eyes of woman playing in the water are filled with haze. Her eyes brim with inexhaustible finesse. Wandering in the Water Mirage Palace cannot be forgotten. Shui Ruji has numerous ways to tempt the hearts and it is difficult to return alive. In the blood-red Coastal Flower Field, the dazzling young man is the Firecloud Lord of Fire Stars Palace, the fourth palace of the five elements. He is like a hellish demon who has come down quietly. The only way to survive is to fight him with all your might. This path is very dangerous. The Earth Mechanisms Palace, the last palace of the five elements, is full of strange mechanisms. You need to step with caution to challenge the Palace Leader Earthdragon King. Do not be fooled by his sick and weak appearance. This man is a twisted, perverted and sadistic creature. The only way to get out is to use force. In the midst of intertwined desires and conflicts, you will finally meet Ghostface Saint, the master of Five Elements Palace. A mask covers the face as well as the heart. Fighting with him will be a stunning duel. But everything comes to an end. When picking up the mask, the heart filled with uncertainty. Everything is an end and a return to the starting point...
ui_Desc_Boss_clone044_jcz=<s><s>He rose to power by killing his former Gold Flowstone Palace master, who was wounded and weak in battle. The desire for money, beauty and human rights is his lifelong pursuit. <br><s><s>Jin Chaozi's Ultimate Skill - the golden thread - is invisible. Because it is invisible, it is the most fearsome weapon as it is everywhere and nowhere.
ui_Desc_Boss_clone044_ltgz=<s><s>Slender and elegant, pure and refined. Years of practicing Heartless Sword made him cold and distant. <br><s><s>The only people who are considered friends and rivals in life are Water Mirage Palace Master Shui Wuji and Scholars Master Xiao Bieqing. <br><s><s>Young Master Liu Ting and Grace Lord had a three-day sword fight at Wood Springflower Palace, which Xiao Bieqing described as "A smiling gentleman and a moved demon". <br><s><s>The sword skill and flying abilities are top notch and unmatched.
ui_Desc_Boss_clone044_srj=<s><s>An outlandish woman who observes no manners and disregards social etiquette. She is a Five Elements Palace devil who is feared by everyone in Foreign Wulin. However, anyone who has seen her in person is amazed by her magnificence and splendor. There is no hint of disgust or hatred in her. <br><s><s>Normally she maintains a stern and silent facade. When bored, she will cause trouble and tease Young Master Liu Ting, showing her ingenious nature.
ui_Desc_Boss_clone044_hysj=<s><s>The best of the best at Five Elements Palace. Handsome, proud and unruly. At the age of twenty he already has become the master of Fire Stars Palace.

ui_Desc_Boss_clone044_tlw=<s><s>Since childhood, he has been suffering from a malady, a weakness in his arms and legs and had to use a wooden wheelchair to get around. Later, he was brought to the palace by Ghostface Saint, the head of Five Elements Palace. Although healed, he could only grow up to be a child-like dwarf. <br><s><s>Intelligent, cunning and twisted. He tortures people smiling as if it is a child's mischief, instilling cold terror.
ui_Desc_Boss_clone044_gmsz=<s><s>The head of Five Elements Palace, the true ruler of Night City.

Ghost City is also the largest black market in Foreign Jianghu. This mysterious frontier tends to have many untold secrets. There is also a group of people who are not willing to be exposed to the sun, preferring to live like hosts in the dark and carry out some shady business. Doing business in Ghost City allows you to send black goods through the Netherworld River to any place and any country. Even human trafficking is possible here. Ghost City is run by four Ghost Kings, the leader is called Ghost Hell King, the other three Ghost Kings are Gui Shasha, Gui Sanniang, Gui Wudao. Gui Shasha is well versed in the science of poison, excels at poison use and snake control, and capable of confusing the masses. Gui Wudao is gifted with divine powers and a penchant for killing. Likes to inflict a painful death with no reason. Gui Sanniang is an eerie character good at mind-boggling illusions. Ghost Hell King is able to manage Ghost City well and unify the three kings. The rumor is that he is a skilled and secretive man... The journey through the mysterious Ghost City for the search of truth is destined to be a thrilling one. Only by passing the trials of the four Ghost Kings will you be able to reap greater rewards.

When he is a demon king, he is irritable and has a passion for killing, and no one can stop him from slaughtering everyone.

ui_CloneStory953=<s><s>In the mountains near Ghost City, there is a fire-red gigantic python named Snake King Chi Yin. It spends years in underground caves and devours black earth containing volcanic lava. Therefore, the poop droppings of Snake King Chi Yin are flammable and explosive, and even as powerful as large firearms. Ghost Hell King calls those explosive poops Ghost Pills. He always sends his men to collect Ghost Pills at great risk when Snake King Chi Yin leaves the cave and stores them in the Ghost Cave of the Ghost City. Ghost Hell King sends a large number of guards to guard Ghost Cave all year round. They say that Ghost City's secret stockpile of Ghost Pills is enough to destroy a country. This is the reason why Ghost City has been standing in Foreign Wulin for decades. Ghost Hell King warns the people of Ghost City that Snake King Chi Yin is extremely bloodthirsty, vicious and dangerous, and that the people of Ghost City should not go near that cave. However, if Snake King Chi Yin feces are such a rare and precious weapon, its whole body must be a treasure, coveted by Jianghu commoners. Hiss... The low hissing sound of a huge thing approaching... Do not stare into its eyes. This will only make it more furious, wanting to devour everything in front of it.
