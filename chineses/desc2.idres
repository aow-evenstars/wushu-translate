cj_015_007_003=The villa master looks to be very nice to people and he has a good reputation. Strange why Jianghu figures have always been making an enemy of him. But that's why all of us guards were recruited.

cj_015_033_001=Even if I'm more than qualified to act as assistant, my blacksmith skill is still insufficient to forge weapons on my own. I was apprenticed because my boss was understaffed.
cj_015_033_002=My dream is to forge an unequaled legendary weapon. It is absolutely necessary to take some practice at the blacksmith’s beforehand.

cj_015_037_003=I've lived in Jinling for some time and got some knowledge about the locals. One day I learned that the storekeeper of the grocery store is very easy-going and willing to pay his men high wages, so I got a job here.
cj_015_038_001=I'm excited every time I see money. So I really like my job in the Bank.
cj_015_038_002=I was robbed by a group of bandits. I have to work in the Bank to earn some money.
cj_015_038_003=Safety is most important in a bank. I have some skills, so I was recruited to guard the bank.

cj_015_044_002=As the saying goes "Those who serve the Minister have power equal to that of a Grade 7 Officer". Working as a servant in the minister's mansion should count me minor official.
cj_015_044_003=I'm here for that maid. Disguising myself as a servant is my first step to win her heart. I'm so attracted to her that even my reputation as a Jianghu hero becomes no longer important to me.

cj_015_046_003=The mansion is said to have hidden treasure, so I managed to sneak into the manor disguised as a servant to investigate.
cj_015_047_001=They carefully choose men here. If it weren't for the fact that I've been learning kung fu since childhood, I would have failed the test of spear and staff usage, which is to say I wouldn't have made it as a soldier.
cj_015_047_002=Stone City is a place of military importance. Its security is reinforced all year round. When The imperial court is undermanned we Jianghu people are sent here instead.
cj_015_047_003=As the saying goes "He who is a real man would never become a soldier". But kung fu is the only skill I've got, which has left me no choice.
cj_015_048_001=Working here, these strange-looking foreigners can often be seen. That broadens one's horizons.
cj_015_048_002=If it weren't for the fact that I can get a better pay here than elsewhere, I wouldn't have been willing to come close to these uncivilized barbarians.
cj_015_048_003=If it weren't for the fact that I was robbed by mountain bandits, I wouldn't have ended up working as a laborer here.

cj_015_050_001=I learned some basic skills. So I join an Escort Agency to test my skills.
cj_015_050_002=I'm not bragging but I'm skilled at kung fu, I'm honest and trustworthy, which qualifies me as an escort.
cj_015_050_003=The more robbers are out there, the more promising the Escort Agency business will be. That is the sole reason why I came here to be an escort.

cj_015_051_002=Working here in the post house only involves light work except that the stable is relatively smelly for clean-up. I am perfectly suited for the job.

cj_015_052_001=I've been enjoying watching Chinese operas. By coincidence, they were recruiting people when I got here. Considering that could get me both money and operas, I joined without a second thought.

cj_015_054_003=I was forced to work in the Brothel.
cj_015_055_001=I regret that I was not able to be skilled at kung fu, otherwise when I was sightseeing in Jianghu I wouldn't have been caught and forced into prostitution in here.
cj_015_055_002=It was careless of me to be sold to this place after being blindsided in the dark by a person in black robe. Thank goodness I was no layman in dances and songs, otherwise I'd have to prostitute myself to buy back my own freedom.
cj_015_055_003=I was caught here. Help!
cj_015_056_001=I broke an expensive vase when I worked in a rich family. Then I was expelled and became a beggar.
cj_015_056_002=It may be strange, but I'm happier being a beggar than a business tycoon.
cj_015_056_003=Beggar can only beg for food and cannot find a job.
cj_015_057_001=This place has impressive views. Not bothering to stop by to do some painting would be my biggest loss.
cj_015_057_002=The immediate sight of the pleasant scenery of this place makes me start to feel like that I'm making a painting. I'll, after all, make a painting before setting out again.
cj_015_057_003=My painting skill is truly remarkable. Coming across so beautiful a scenery beckons me to put my skills into use.
cj_016_001_001=A friend of mine happened to work here in this martial arts competition venue, so for convenience I was introduced to the job of Luoyang City guard.
cj_016_001_002=Thanks to my kung fu, I became a Chengdu city guard as expected.
cj_016_001_003=Having wandered in Jianghu for a long time, I was longing to live a different life. I'm not particularly good at anything, but it was my shallow kung fu that got me the job of Luoyang city guard.
cj_016_001_004=Thank goodness I have some skills, or I couldn't get the job here.
cj_016_002_001=There seem to be extraordinarily rich fishing resources here. So I resumed my career as a fisherman.

cj_016_005_003=I was caught here. Help!
cj_016_006_001=The kind of look and skill set I got brought me nothing - I could neither use them to get a normal job nor could I use them to become a prostitute. Working as a laborer is the only thing I can do.
cj_016_006_002=I came to this brothel while under the influence of alcohol last time, and ended up working for them as a labore to pay the bills.
cj_016_006_003=I planned to come here to dine and dash. I didn't expect a master of kung fu to be here in this little pleasure house. So the master took me and they made me a compensating toiler for a couple of days.

cj_016_009_001=Being sick of the fact that you have to fight to live, I'm here to do some reading for a change.
cj_016_009_002=Imagine a secret script of kung fu is placed before your eyes, wouldn't it be a pity if you couldn't read it? One must also be educated while practicing martial arts.
cj_016_009_003=A little kung fu is dangerous. He who wants to be a good kung fu learner also has to be knowledgeable. That's why I paid to learn how to read.
cj_016_010_001=I traveled all around and spent all my money. So I join the Escort Agency and become an escort there.

cj_016_014_002=Commoners have been giving unanimous thumbs-up to this officer. I'll find out what kind of a man he really is in a couple of days. If he is indeed a righteous officer, I would server under him with all my heart.
cj_016_014_003=I work for The imperial court and I'm tasked with becoming one of the itinerant fighters. For the sake of the salary, I would still play it safe by following suit after my colleagues, though I know that itinerant fighters are generally inclined to be averse to collaborating with The imperial court.

cj_016_016_003=It was my shallow kung fu that got me the job of Luoyang city constable.

cj_016_018_003=Although I'm not good at musical instrument playing, it would be a piece of cake to get the job - after all, what I have to do is to simply mislead those charlatans and laymen into thinking I'm quite skilled at it.

cj_016_020_001=I was promoted to a guard in the Lord Residence.
cj_016_020_002=They carefully choose men in this mansion. If it weren't for the fact that I've been learning kung fu since childhood, I would have failed the test of spear and staff usage, which is to say I wouldn't have made it as a guard.

cj_016_028_002=True it's just a small business, but I would rather work as a free man than serve under someone.
cj_016_028_003=It does you no harm to make some small business in your spare time—they say you could make a fortune reselling some commodities rare to be found here in the local area.
cj_016_029_001=I've been robbed by bandits. So I become a beggar now.
cj_016_029_002=War has brought me nothing but misery. I hope some savior in Luoyang city could come to my aid.

cj_016_030_003=I can do better than just reciting poems.

cj_016_031_003=There are many animals here. So I start hunting to improve my life.

cj_018_015_002=True it’s just a small business, but I would rather work as a free unconstrained man than serve under someone.
cj_018_015_003=I got some fine commodities, but I've been having trouble selling them. This place has a very limited market. Guess I'll have to try my luck in another place.

cj_018_016_002=The soil here is very fertile. I'd been through lots of nasty fights in my life and I'm tired of that. For a change, I'm here to live the ordinary life of a peasant.

cj_021_008_002=As a strong man, I didn't expect to succumb to the climate and get sick. Despite that, I survived - a local saved me. To return the favor, I decided to stay to help them guard this place.
cj_021_008_003=A bunch of suspicious looking people arrived in the village. Everybody is worried and wants me to protect them.
cj_021_009_001=They requested me for this. I'm a part-timer.
cj_021_009_002=When it comes to the harvest or sowing season, the peasant is always in need of extra hands.
cj_021_009_003=Workers in this mountain stronghold have been disappearing under mysterious circumstances. I'm looking into it disguised as a laborer.
cj_021_010_001=I'm not skilled at kung fu, but I have the muscle to do manual labor—It is a good job as long as it lets you earn your living.
cj_021_010_002=It's not easy to get a job these days. Fortunately, I have the muscle a laborer needs.
cj_021_010_003=If it hadn't been for the fact that the foreman was an acquaintance, I'm afraid I'd have been jobless, not to mention having to sell my toil.
cj_021_011_001=Post house is a great place for getting intelligence.
cj_021_011_002=Working here in the post house only involves light work except that the stable is relatively smelly for clean-up. I have perfect suitability for the job.
cj_021_011_003=The most crowded post house is the best place for asking around about Jianghu anecdote. I'm inquisitive and I enjoy working here.
cj_021_012_001=Seven-Star Hall is wealthy. You will make something of yourself working for them.
cj_021_012_002=Seven-Star Hall has  made an enemy of ar very strong faction. For self-protection, they have to recruit many new guards. Speaking of which, I regret having joined the sect.
cj_021_012_003=There are many candidates for this job to sift through. If not for my advanced kung fu, I wouldn't have been retained by the Hall leader.
cj_021_013_001=Seven-Star Hall is undermanned even as it is expanding. I'm desperate to get paid, so I joined the sect as a laborer.
cj_021_013_002=Seven-Star Hall has a very large business to run and must be in need of handymen. I'm also joining them for a couple of days.
cj_021_013_003=It's an easy job. No need to do menial labor, well paid, and a chance to watch disciples practice kung fu. I may even learn a thing or two from them.
cj_021_014_001=People easily succumb to the changing climate and get sick. The drugstore has always been busy. I see the job as an opportunity to advance my medical skills.
cj_021_014_002=The pharmacy was expanding when I got here. I've learned a lot of Chinese traditional medicine and I was thought of by the storekeeper as a promising jolly lad. That’s why I'm one of them here.
cj_021_014_003=I got a job here because I'm very experienced. Even the storekeeper praises me for my talent for Chinese traditional medicine.
cj_021_015_001=With some effort I managed to walk to Xiangyang Hill, only to find my money all spent. I found this tea house to be very easy-going with its workers. So I decided to work for them before I have enough money to hit the road again.

cj_021_016_003=Shrine of the Heroines is quite expansive. It must be in need of men to do maintenance work. I happened to be free, so I went there.
cj_021_017_001=As a heroine, I have to find a job that fits me well. The Realm of the Women is the ideal place for me to work. I will stay until I have enough money to travel.
cj_021_017_002=A woman often has to work twice as hard as a man for the same job. That's why I like how they treat me here at the Realm of the Women.

cj_021_019_002=Mutual help between the two denominations has nothing to do with the minor disagreements in how Buddhism should be perceived.
cj_021_019_003=True Tibetan Buddhism and Chinese Buddhism don't share the same origin. The space for improvement lies in letting the two learn from each other.
cj_021_020_001=This place doesn't even have a decent market. It's such a nuisance having to yell as you peddle your goods.
cj_021_020_002=True it’s just a small business, but I would rather work as a free unconstrained man than serve under someone.
cj_021_020_003=Traveler, you face a dangerous world. It's not just the people who do evil, but also because of those who don't do anything about it. I am weak, but I strive to be strong, by peddling in the woods and mountains regardless of possible robbers.
cj_021_020_004=I got some fine commodities recently. Difficult to sell them, though. This place’s got very limited bazaars, making it very difficult to sell the stock so far. Guess I’ll have to chance my luck by moving on to another place.
cj_021_021_001=I wanted to visit the spirit temple, only to run into a bunch of bandits on the way. I was lucky to succeed in pretending to join them.

cj_021_021_003=It'll be very dangerous if you get lost in the snowy mountain. Lucky of me to come across men from Snowbird Stronghold. I joined them since I was jobless.

cj_022_003_001=I’d been through lots of nasty murder in my life and I was tired of that. Thanks to my great skill of chopping logs, I'm able to live an ordinary life as a woodcutter.
cj_022_003_002=After having moved to this barren wasteland, I haven't got any idea how to make a living. The only thing I can do is to chop firewood and sell it for money in the hope of solving the most urgent need of survival.
cj_022_003_003=I would rather work as a free unconstrained logger than serve under someone. The difference is in that being a logger means you don’t always have to stay alert to act according to the boss’s changing countenance, though you would earn more as an employee.

cj_022_010_003=Sect Leader is concerned about the guarding of this place. He sent me.
cj_022_013_001=He who has a weapon in his hand is not necessarily strong. He who has a mop and a piece of cleaning cloth in his hand is not necessarily weak.
cj_022_013_002=That's fine with me - I don't want any part of this disgusting poison based skill.
cj_022_013_003=I've no gift for martial arts? How am I supposed to live with that?
cj_022_014_001=He who has a weapon in his hand is not necessarily strong. He who has a mop and a piece of cleaning cloth in his hand is not necessarily weak.
cj_022_014_002=That’s very fit for me—I don't want any part of this disgusting Poison based skill.

cj_022_015_001=The police won't look after us, so we're on our own. Someone has to guard the gates.
cj_022_015_002=It's very difficult to live a peasant's life. We can only count on ourselves to deal with the bad crops and the mountain bandits.
cj_022_015_003=There is nothing more valuable than family. We must guard them with our lives.
cj_022_015_004=People from all factions have been wanting to sneak into the stronghold. We are forced to strengthen the defense.
cj_022_017_001=We still have to protect the stronghold and maintain its daily routines.
cj_022_017_002=Danger is everywhere when you travek. Once you've had your share of adventures, it's good to settle down and live a peaceful life.
cj_022_017_003=I'm done with all the vendettas and acts of vengeance in jianghu. Let me settle down anywhere to get away from it all.
cj_023_001_001=I still have fond memories of my good old days herding flock in the vast grassland.

cj_023_004_003=If it hadn't been for the fact the Lingxiao City has been frequently pestered by troublemakers, their leader wouldn't have to recruit men all the time. Many thanks to them for getting me this job.
cj_023_005_001=Lingxiao City's martial arts are impressive in terms of its pre-emptive attack, nothing more. Still, it's a good set of skills to learn.
cj_023_005_002=Training in this harsh wintry environment has its benefits. You will become instinctively more resilient.

cj_023_007_001=Snow Villa, located at the foot of Lingxiao City, is solemn and serene. It's a good place for me to settle down, leaving all the chaos and misery of jianghu behind.

cj_023_007_003=I had a narrow escape when I got lost in the harsh, wintry landscape. If it weren't for the villa master, I would have been dead already. So you see I have a reason to work for him.
cj_023_008_001=Lingxiao City is undergoing expansion. The lumber mill is in great need of strong, eager workers like me.

cj_024_001_002=Look, it's not a disgrace for Jianghu people to become involved with mountain bandits.
cj_024_001_003=The stronghold leader is very kind to his followers. He even allows those who do not wish to stay to leave freely, with no question asked. How can I pass up such a nice place as this?

cj_024_002_002=War has brought me nothing but misery. I was lucky to come across the stronghold leader.

cj_024_005_003=This Taoist temple stands no comparison with Wudang Mountain temples. It has abundant incense based contributors, and the scenery of it is uniquely enjoyable, though. Being able to practice here would still live up to people’s expectations on the basis of your identity.

cj_024_008_003=It's an easy job. The pay is good, and I get a chance to watch people practicing kung fu.
cj_024_009_001=I have been admiring Ximen the Hero for a long time. It's just that I still haven't been able to work in his Wanmei Villa. This place is nearby. I will work here for a couple of days trying to get a chance of working there.

cj_024_015_004=Thunderbolt Hall is operating a very big business, wealthy enough for me to have a share joining them. If the Hall Leader values me as a promising worker, maybe I could have the opportunity to learn how firearm is made.
cj_024_016_001=Officials and soldiers here have a good reputation for their deeds. It wouldn't do me any harm to lend them my hand.

cj_024_018_003=The pleasant climate results in many herbs in the mountains nearby. I won't miss the chance.
cj_025_001_001=I've long heard that Devil's Gate is very spooky. Now that I'm one of these guards, I have my chance to take a good look.
cj_025_001_002=That was my first visit to the desert. I didn't know about the terrain and geography, which led me to lose my way. I was lucky to be saved by the leader. So you see I have every reason to stay and work as a bodyguard for him.
cj_025_001_003=If I remembered it right, Ghost Town is said to be bustling and prosperous. How come it is actually so shabby and empty? I must investigate.
cj_025_002_001=If life hadn't been so difficult for me, I wouldn't have come and worked here. They have been said to be demonic cannibals. The way I see it, their behavior has led me to believe that they don't live up to that name.
cj_025_002_002=Sigh. I've no choice but to do menial labor. If I had worked hard in kung fu, I wouldn't end up like this.
cj_025_002_003=Desert Ghost Town and the so-called Silent Temple are closely connected. I sneaked into this place disguised as a laborer to learn more.
cj_025_003_001=I wandered to Dunhuang, and couldn't find a single job. I've no choice but to sell street performances here.
cj_025_003_002=It is sometimes unavoidable even for a hero to have to find something to live on.
cj_025_003_003=Jianghu is not all about vendettas and epic battles. You still have to find a way to feed yourself. Me, I'm a street performer.
cj_025_003_004=You want to rob the rich and feed the poor? It's your life on the line. If your kung fu is not up to it, I suggest you pick a safer way to make a living.
cj_025_004_001=Having always envied the privileges of the authorities, I never thought that I would ever have the chance to become an official myself.
cj_025_004_002=Jianghu people distrust the authorities. However, if being an official would benefit commoners, there is no shame in doing so.
cj_025_004_003=Maybe it's not possible for me to become a great public servant, but I'll do my best to protect the citizens.
cj_025_004_004=Look, being an official is better than being an outlaw. I can still live up to the expectations of my master as long as I uphold my morals.
cj_025_005_001=This Buddhist holy ground has been plagued by thieves. As a believer, how can I just stand by and do nothing?
cj_025_005_002=A Buddhist holy ground must be guarded to preserve its sanctity. I am doing my part.
cj_025_005_003=There are valuable Buddhist artifacts hidden in the Mogao Caves. I will not let this sacred place be violated by greedy thieves.
cj_025_005_004=As a devout Buddhist, I must protect Mogao Caves from those who would violate its sanctity.
cj_025_006_001=Now that the Heaven Net Cult can thrive in this area, they must have gotten something. I will learn what they know before making my next move.
cj_025_006_002=Heaven Net Cult and the remaining survivors of North Yuan Dynasty are closely related. I sneaked into this place in the hope of finding some useful information.
cj_025_006_003=Nobody knows who commands the Heaven Net Cult. Now that I have the opportunity, I will make good use of it to investigate.
cj_025_007_001=They say the Heaven Net Cult is an evil bunch. But if they feed us and give us shelter, I have no complaints.
cj_025_007_002=I've stumbled into Heaven Net Cult territory. I pretended to be a common laborer so that they wouldn't kill me.
cj_025_007_003=It was careless of me to lose the money bag to a pickpocket. Now I'm penniless I have to be here for a couple of days.
cj_025_008_001=This is the lodging for Mogao Caves' visitors. We're under pressure to keep this place safe. The leader is in favor of inviting Jianghu people to help with the security.
cj_025_008_002=This place cannot be counted as prosperous, but considering it's in the middle of a desert, it's bustling. At times, travelers and merchants would find lodging and spend the night here, so the leader has found quite a few Jianghu people to keep the peace.
cj_025_008_003=I wanted to join the army, only to be rejected. I've no choice but to work as a guard first.
cj_025_008_004=Dunhuang has quite a few treasures under safe custody. Now that access wouldn't be granted overnight, we'd be better off getting prepared for a long waiting first.
cj_025_009_001=Large Flag Sect is very well known in Jianghu. You wouldn't lose face for any job you do here including laborers.
cj_025_009_002=The Tie Family have been running the Large Flag Sect for a very long time. The family is very strong in the desert. I'm honored to work for them.
cj_025_009_003=There has been a bounty from Central Plains on the exact location of Large Flag Sect. I happened to walk past this place, and I plan to stay here for a couple of days until I find out more about it.
cj_025_010_001=I got some fine commodities recently. Difficult to sell them, though. This place’s got very limited bazaars, making it very difficult to sell the stock so far. Guess I’ll have to chance my luck by moving on to another place.
cj_025_010_002=It does you no harm to make some small business in your spare time—you can make a fortune reselling some commodities rare to be found here.
cj_025_010_003=True it’s just a small business, but I would rather work as a free unconstrained man than serve under someone.
cj_025_010_004=Having seen some valuable items not to be found elsewhere other than Central Plains, I made bargains and bought several of them, in the hope of selling them for a fortune.
cj_025_011_001=It is rumored that western territory is scheming against the imperial court. The court has sent in more reinforcements. I joined them knowing that they were indeed in urgent need of workers.
cj_025_011_002=I joined the army knowing that they were indeed in urgent need of workers.
cj_025_011_003=Horse bandits are conspiring to enter Central Plains to rob us. The general of the army thought more soldiers and workers are necessary, so he has been procuring the services of Jianghu people.
cj_025_012_001=Yumen Pass, the portal to the northwest of Ming Empire, is in urgent need of sentry services. The defending general kept me because he found me to be smart and good at flying skills.
cj_025_012_002=Few people would be willing to guard such a shabby frontier town.
cj_025_013_001=It's difficult to find water in a desert. I made my way to this supply depot, only to lose my money. I'm taking some odd jobs until I can get back on my feet.
cj_025_013_002=Getting lost in the desert spell certain doom. I was lucky to be saved by someone and sent back. In order to collect enough money for my way home, I decided to work as a laborer for a couple of days here.
cj_025_013_003=I offended and made an enemy of someone strong in Central Plains, only to end up hiding here. I have to keep a low profile for a couple of years until they just let go of it.
cj_025_014_001=You don't even have enough to eat here. Being a horse bandit is the only thing I can do to keep myself from starving.
cj_025_014_002=As long as I can fill my stomach, I don't mind being a horse bandit. Survival is all I really care about.
cj_025_014_003=The horse bandits here are very brutal. Jianghu people are determined to put an end to it. Before that, I will have to convince them who I am pretending to be.
cj_025_015_001=Jiayu Pass is one of the most important passes of the Great Wall. The imperial court has been procuring the services of Jianghu people.
cj_025_015_002=As the saying goes "He who is a real man would never become a soldier". But kung fu is the only skill I've got, which has left me no choice.
cj_025_015_003=Jiayu Pass is one of the most strategically important places for border defense. The imperial court have sent in excessive soldier. More reinforcements are being queued. I have succeeded in getting a job here.
cj_025_016_001=The imperial court have been putting up notices pretty much everywhere, to recruit workers to fortify the frontier town. I knew it was indeed an urgent business, so I came.
cj_025_016_002=Jiayu Pass is one of the most important places for border defense of the Ming Empire. The imperial court have issued the order to have all renovations done as soon as possible.
cj_025_016_003=Bad luck could sneak up on you. I was robbed on my way here. Then I had to work as a laborer. Heaven knows what's next.
cj_026_001_001=Prairie Wolf Gang is remarkably strong in the Western Plains.
cj_026_001_002=Prairie Wolf Gang is the right place for me.
cj_026_001_003=I have to adapt myself to the environment. Working with Prairie Wolf Gang is my best choice.
cj_026_002_001=Xining Town is plagued by bandits. To protect the town and to earn some money, I became a guard.
cj_026_002_002=Xining Town needs more men to defend itself. Since I know kung fu, I did the right thing by becoming a guard.
cj_026_002_003=If it weren't for the good of the people, I would have refused to work as a guard here.
cj_026_002_004=A real chivalric learner of martial arts must always put his martial arts to good use, and would always be glad to help those in peril. Now I happened to witness a bunch of bandits bullying some innocent civilians of Xining Town, how can I stand by and let that happen?
cj_026_003_001=Actually I had no intention of becoming a mountain bandit. It's just that sometimes you've no choice.
cj_026_003_002=A friend of mine, a ringleader of a mountain stronghold, persuaded me into joining him.
cj_026_003_003=They say life in the plains isn't easy. I learned that the hard way, having spent all my money. I had no choice but to become a stronghold bandit.
cj_026_003_004=I want to buy a present for my friend's father, who is celebrating his sixtieth birthday. A quick stint as a bandit will fill my pockets soon enough.
cj_026_004_001=As long as I get enough money to go on with my trip, I don't care what kind of person is running the inn.
cj_026_004_002=I want to learn more about the person running this inn. I heard he's well-connected.
cj_026_004_003=This inn is the only one available in this area. If you want the latest news from travelers, get a job here.
cj_026_005_001=The grassland adjacent to Xining Town belongs to Thunderbolt Hall. That's quite a piece of real estate.
cj_026_005_002=You can tell how wealthy Thunderbolt Hall is by simply seeing how much grassland they own here.
cj_026_005_003=Thunderbolt Hall is so good at making firearms that even the weapons of Shenji Camp cannot compare to theirs. I must sneak into the Hall to see if I can steal some.
cj_026_005_004=I have long since wanted to join the Thunderbolt Hall to learn how their bullets are made. I'm ready to carry out the plan to get transferred to their headquarters.
cj_026_006_001=Flying Eagle Stronghold is behind the black market here. I need to take this opportunity to look into it.
cj_026_006_002=The black market has a lot of rare and precious items. Now that I'm one of them in the Flying Eagle Stronghold, I can try to lay hands on the items at any time. Money is guaranteed if I can find the right buyer.
cj_026_006_003=Trading at the black market is very profitable. The pay itself is not bad, either. So I came to the Flying Eagle Stronghold.
cj_026_007_001=The herdsmen here are constantly harassed by the horse bandits. So they paid us to help guard this village.
cj_026_007_002=The horse bandits were robbing merchants and herdsmen when I came by. I will make them pay for their crimes!
cj_026_007_003=The herdsmen are very hospitable to us foreigners. To return the favor, we offer to protect them from the mounted bandits.
cj_026_008_001=Life is unfair. That's why justice must be upheld with force, by soldiers like me.
cj_026_008_002=Life as a soldier in peacetime can be rather dull, but that's not really a bad thing.
cj_026_008_003=As a soldier, I really don't care which side I fight for, as long as they feed me.
cj_026_009_001=The Khan of the Tartars has been plotting to take over the central plains for quite some time now. Their latest massive recruitment of soldiers is a disturbing development. I must investigate further.
cj_026_009_002=The Tartars lost many men during their recent civil unrest. Now they are recruiting men by the thousands.
cj_026_009_003=They are very selective with their recruits. If it weren't for the fact that I've been learning kung fu since childhood, I would have failed the test.
cj_026_010_001=It's dangerous to work at this outpost. If not for money, I wouldn't have come.
cj_026_010_002=Even if the death rate at the outpost is far higher than those of other camps, I would still be willing to become one of them as long as they make me an offer I can't refuse.
cj_026_010_003=I have known about the Khan of the Tartars' ambition in the plains for quite some time. This is my chance to infiltrate their camps and spy on them.
cj_026_011_001=This place is located high up on the mountain, making it a difficult and dangerous place to reach. The potential trespasser to Supreme Hall would have to be so poorly informed as to ever want to get here.
cj_026_011_002=Western Xia had long since been extinct. Supreme Hall is still very strong though.
cj_026_011_003=Supreme Hall has been in slow decline. However, never underestimate its capabilities. I will keep an eye on it disguised as their guard.
cj_026_012_001=Supreme Hall has a bad reputation in Central Plains, it is very strong though.
cj_026_012_002=If not for learning the martial arts of Supreme Hall, I wouldn't have come to this place.
cj_026_012_003=Despite the fact that Western Xia no longer exists, Supreme Hall is still wealthy and generous to its disciples. It's still worth the risk to work for them.
cj_026_012_004=Supreme Hall is scheming to restore its rule of Western Xia. I have sneaked into the Hall to investigate. If the scheme is true, I will send the information to the authorities.
cj_026_013_001=I got some fine commodities recently. Difficult to sell them, though. This place’s got very limited bazaars, making it very difficult to sell the stock so far. Guess I’ll have to chance my luck by moving on to another place.
cj_026_013_002=It does you no harm to make some small business in your spare time—you can make a fortune reselling some commodities rare to be found here.
cj_026_013_003=True it’s just a small business, but I would rather work as a free unconstrained man than serve under someone.
cj_026_014_001=I'm just a laborer. I neither know nor care what goes on at the Supreme Hall.
cj_026_014_002=I've accidentally stumbled upon Supreme Hall territory, and they made me a guard to look for more trespassers. How ironic.
cj_026_014_003=Working at the Supreme Hall as a laborer is not bad. At least nobody would have the guts to make an enemy of me.
cj_026_015_001=There is a lot of tomb raiding going on. Western Xia people are concerned for the royal tomb's security, so several martial artists have been hired as guards.
cj_026_015_002=The royal tomb of Western Xia has much hidden treasure. Pity that the place is closely guarded. I've no choice but to blend into their ranks, waiting for an opportunity to make the move.
cj_026_015_003=With an effort I managed to get a job, only to end up having to work with a bunch of guys to guard a tomb.
cj_026_015_004=Descendents of Western Xia aristocrats would sometimes come here to clean the tomb for their ancestors. By disguising myself as a grave keeper, I might be able to catch one of them for his worth.
cj_026_016_001=There seem to be extraordinarily rich fishing resources in this place. So I resumed my career as a fisherman.
cj_026_016_002=There seem to be rich fishing resources in this place. So I resumed my career as a fisherman.
cj_026_016_003=To cultivate myself, I fish at the river alone.
cj_026_017_001=I studied medicine when I was young. So I always collect some herbs in the wild.
cj_026_017_002=There are many rare herbs here. So I go to collect rare herbs in the mountains again.
cj_026_017_003=The pleasant climate results in many herbs in the mountains nearby. I won't miss the chance.

title_newworld_xiyu_a2_005_2_3=People love money and will go to extremes to posses it. Their personal reasons are their own and I can only be sure of my own. What about you?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_005_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>I prefer a free and uninhibited life rather than one defined by riches.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_005_3_1=Yet, how can one live a free life in this land?
newworld_xiyu_a2_005_3_1_1=You already have a free life now.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_005_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>I desire a world under my control, be is through wealth or force.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_005_3_2=Such power and wealth will be meaningless once you have passed. What vulgar thinking.
newworld_xiyu_a2_005_3_2_1=I am a common Jianghu person. If I do pursue it, I will be completely unknown in Jianghu.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_006_2_4=It's terrible. Blood is being shed even in the remote and secret areas of the Western Region. Will you help to restore peace to the Western Region?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_006_2_4=People die for wealth, birds die for food. Humans always have their own rules and justice. What is your opinion on this?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_006_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>The Western Region has become a battlefield contending for the treasure of Loulan. If these people lose their desire, the unrest will be over.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_006_3_1=Nonsense. That is not the way to end this situation.
newworld_xiyu_a2_006_3_1_1=You are kind-hearted. My choice is improper to you.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_006_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font> If I cannot correct it then I shall stay away from the turmoil.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_006_3_2=Such will be difficult to achieve.
newworld_xiyu_a2_006_3_2_1=What I mind is I will never be guilty. That is enough.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_007_2_2=There is much unrest here. Why bring a Qin and not a sword? Surely you must have some interest in the treasure.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_007_2_2=Wealth does not interest me. Music is my passion and what I live for. Is there something wrong with that?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_007_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>It would be a great loss if you were to give up the sword. If you immerse yourself in music you will lose your aggression.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_007_3_1=You cannot understand as you have no interest or passion in music. I would like to play music to express my will.
newworld_xiyu_a2_007_3_1_1=Well, good luck!
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_007_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>You've given up sword and replaced it with music. Why? Is it because you cannot find someone who is your match with a sword, thus taking up music as a new challenge?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_007_3_2=You are right. Even my good friends cannot fill that emptiness.
newworld_xiyu_a2_007_3_2_1=May you find a blossom friend one day!
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_008_2_3=The treasure of Loulan has brought many people to this land. What is your opinion on this situation?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_008_2_3=It is strange that the treasure should appear at this time. Whatever though, my interest is in Desert Star. What is your reason for being her?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_008_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>I care not for the treasure. I have always wanted to roam and view the majesty of the Western Region and so I am here,
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_008_3_1=Do the people of the Central Plains see things as you do?
newworld_xiyu_a2_008_3_1_1=Stop kidding me. I am unknown in Jianghu. There are some many experts in Central Plains. They will contend for Loulan Treasure.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_008_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>I have heard much about a mysterious prize in the Western Region which is said to contain the meaning in life. I hope to find it.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_008_3_2=It's location is a secret and those who now it may no longer be alive. If you are successful, please share your findings with me.
newworld_xiyu_a2_008_3_2_1=Well, I am afraid I cannot find it.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_009_2_2=With all the upheaval and unrest around you, why continue this quest for the treasure?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_009_2_2=Most of these treasure hunters are here from the Central Plains! The treasure belongs to the Western Region. I will not allow it to fall into their hands. What is your reason for being here? You talk as if you want me to quit in order to better your chances.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_009_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>Of course, not. I am searching for the mysterious rare item which is said to contain the meaning of life.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_009_3_1=How did you know about it? Well regardless, you'd best for about it or you could lose your life.
newworld_xiyu_a2_009_3_1_1=Take it easy. I can protect myself well.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_009_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>To be frank, I am also vying for the treasure but I lack the skill to get it myself I plan to steal it from the victors while they are weakened.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_009_3_2=Well you are honest but I will tell you nothing further on this subject.
newworld_xiyu_a2_009_3_2_1=I see. Let's wait and see what will happen.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_010_2_3=Do you have any plans for obtaining the treasure? If you don't it will be taken by others.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_010_2_3=Both the Heaven Net Cult and Desert Ghost Town are near equals in strength. If both fight for the treasure they will be greatly weakened. These outsider treasure hunters are the real issue and we crush them like the pests they are. Will you partake in their fate?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_010_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font> I know my own ability. As your friend, I will do the same for you. Wait and see.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_010_3_1=A good choice. You won't regret that decision.
newworld_xiyu_a2_010_3_1_1=Thank you.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_010_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>If they are not truly evil then I will let them go. Though if they are…then their fate is sealed.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_010_3_2=So you say. I'd hate to see the choice you'd actually make.
newworld_xiyu_a2_010_3_2_1=I am sure I can make it.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_011_2_4=I've acquired all three Desert Stars! Here. I hope you can uncover their secret.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_011_2_4=Excellent. If I can obtain the secret of youth, I will be sure to remember how you helped me. For  I appoint you as the Heaven Net Cult Envoy, granting you equal status as the three Saintesses.
newworld_xiyu_a2_011_2_4_1=Thank you.
newworld_xiyu_a2_011_2_4_2=I am not Heaven Net Cult Envoy. Why? (You don't have enough Fame in the western region. Upgrade your Fame to <font color="#FF0000">Level 16</font> and then try again.)
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_011_2_5=What can these <a href="item,item_newworld_xiyu_a1_task_014" style="HLStypebuzz">three Desert Stars</a> do?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_011_2_5=Unfortunately I don't know but the fact that you got them all is impressive.
newworld_xiyu_a2_011_2_5_1=Thank you. Wait, aren't you robbing, are you?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_011_2_6=The treasure of Loulan has led to much bloodshed in this land. Why are so many risking their lives for it?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_011_2_6=Greed leads to irrational actions. What is your reason for being here?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_011_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>The treasure is of no interest to me. The secret of the Desert Stars is what I am after.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_011_3_1=I too am looking for them. Be sure to tell me if you find something.
newworld_xiyu_a2_011_3_1_1=Sure.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_011_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>The treasure is said to contain rare weapons and skills. It is definitely worth pursuing.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_011_3_2=I have heard it has a book of skills strong enough to conquer the world.
newworld_xiyu_a2_011_3_2_1=So amazing!
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_012_2_4=Many heroes have gotten involved in the contention for the treasure. Why not us?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_012_2_4=The situation has become complicated due to the involvement of so many factions. For now I am waiting for the cult leader's order. Why do you ask?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_012_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>The situation is complicated and I do not feel it wise for us to get involved. Holding off would allow us to wait and see how things play out.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_012_3_1=The leader determines what we shall do, not you. You've overplayed your hand. Do you not fear punishment?
newworld_xiyu_a2_012_3_1_1=Why? Dharmapala I just want to do all I can to strengthen Heaven Net Cult. (He is not satisfied with my words.)
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_012_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>Members are scattered all over the Western Region. We should be able to find the treasure with ease, provided the leader says so. Although the Desert Ghost Town, Shi Guanyin and Qiuci are involved, our leader, the Dharmapala and Saintesses can deal with them.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_012_3_2=Haha! Well spoken. I agree.
newworld_xiyu_a2_012_3_2_1=Thank you. (I selected a good choice. Dharmapala looks very happy.)
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_013_2_3=Are we not going to try and obtain the treasure?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_013_2_3=The three Desert Stars are what I am after. As for the treasure of Loulan, put it out of your mind.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_013_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>The treasure is said to contain rare skills and weapons. I wish to obtain these so I will be known all throughout the world.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_013_3_1=Is that what you think? You are pathetically short-sighted.
newworld_xiyu_a2_013_3_1_1=I am sorry. You must be rich in them.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_013_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>I have no interest in the treasure. If the Heaven Net Cult leader wants the Desert Stars,  then I will devote myself to finding them. If I can even but glimpse the meaning in life, my efforts will have been worth it.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_013_3_2=I did not expect you to be so loyal to the Heaven Net Cult.
newworld_xiyu_a2_013_3_2_1=Well, you are the most loyal one.
newworld_xiyu_a2_012_2_3_3=...(Upgrade Heaven Net Cult Affinity to Intimate Level 3 and then try again.)
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_014_2_2=The natives of the Western Region are fighting for the treasure. Do you have any plan on dealing with it?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_014_2_2=The wealth they could attain will mean nothing once they're dead. The fools. Why are you so interested?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_014_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>All people want to live a rich life, no matter their class. What's important is that we amass the wealth in a just way and refuse ill-gotten wealth.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_014_3_1=You have similar ideal to him but what exactly is ill-got wealth? Sounds like an excuse!
newworld_xiyu_a2_014_3_1_1=You are kind of unfair.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_014_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>I care not for the treasure. I'd prefer to spend my life enjoying this wonderful land that clashing over wealth.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_014_3_2=I am a little jealous of your carefree nature.
newworld_xiyu_a2_014_3_2_1=Thank you.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_015_2_2=The natives of the Western Region are fighting for the treasure. Do you have any plan on dealing with it?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_015_2_2=I cannot understand why they shed blood for it. The greedy fools. Though what of you?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_015_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>I will try to find the treasure. If I can obtain it I will use the riches to help and heal all who are in need.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_015_3_1=You have similar ideas to what he had. If my elder sister hears of this, you will be killed.
newworld_xiyu_a2_015_3_1_1=I was not scared to tell you, because you are kind-hearted.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_015_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>I will not spend my life searching for treasure. Though many claim they will use the treasure for good, I do not believe they will. They are no better than thieves.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_015_3_2=I feel your view is too extreme. I believe this can be a good thing.
newworld_xiyu_a2_015_3_2_1=There are too many hypocritical people in Jianghu.
newworld_xiyu_a2_017_4_1_1=You are right.
newworld_xiyu_a2_017_4_2_1=Thank you.
newworld_xiyu_a2_017_4_3_1=I have thought about it. I will face it naturally.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_017_4_4=I have wanted to meet you.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_017_4_4=Haha. You're quite young. Looks like the youths are now emerging to stake their claim in the world.
newworld_xiyu_a2_017_4_4_1=Hope I have the day of being famous!
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_017_4_5=I've got the stone key to the Loulan Treasury. Now if only I knew where the treasury was.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_017_4_5=I am afraid you have to find it by yourself.
newworld_xiyu_a2_017_4_5_1=I see. I am leaving to find it. See you.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_017_4_6=I got the stone key to Loulan Secret Cavern. I wonder where Loulan Secret Cavern is.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_017_4_6=Know that if you cannot protect it once obtained, then perhaps you should not pursue it.
newworld_xiyu_a2_017_4_6_1=Take it easy. I have though about it. It will never fall into evil guys' hands.
newworld_xiyu_a2_021_2_5_1=Of course. I will take my leave now.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_021_2_6=I will do Daily Quests to increase my affinity with other factions.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_021_2_6=Alright. I need to make some medicine to cure Yunyu. You can help.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_021_3_3=No problem!
newworld_xiyu_a2_021_2_6_1=No problem!
menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_007_2_2=Well it seems most in this land are determined to claim the treasure.
title_newworld_xiyu_a3_007_2_2=My concerned is regaining the throne from my uncle. What is your opinion on that?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_007_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>Of course. All should be at the Emperor's command.
title_newworld_xiyu_a3_007_3_1=The officers rise in rebellion. My people should help me put them down!
newworld_xiyu_a3_007_3_1_1=Rebellion without righteous cause is doomed to be put down!
menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_007_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>Water can carry a boat, but it also sink a boat. We should respect the public opinion.
title_newworld_xiyu_a3_007_3_2=If the people are stupid and their will is not the same as God, what shall we do?
newworld_xiyu_a3_007_3_2_1=The existence of the emperor is subject to the existence of the people. The people's will must also be the emperor's will.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_008_2_4=Have you heard about the appearance of the Loulan Treasure Map?
title_newworld_xiyu_a3_008_2_4=Another greedy treasure hunter…Amitabha.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_008_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>Would it not be a good thing if the treasure was to benefit all people?
title_newworld_xiyu_a3_008_3_1=Amitabha... That would be a wise way to use it.
newworld_xiyu_a3_008_3_1_1=Master…
menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_008_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice</font>I know well that sin yields bitter fruit.
title_newworld_xiyu_a3_008_3_2=Amitabha. You are right.
newworld_xiyu_a3_008_3_2_1=See you.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a1_015_2_1=Are you here because of the treasure of Loulan?
newworld_xiyu_a1_015_2_1_1=You are firm. I admire you very much.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_001_2_1=You've been very active of late. Is it due to the treasure of Loulan?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_001_2_1=I don't care about the treasure of Loulan, I am merely following orders. What about you? If you're hear for the treasure, I'd quit now. You're too weak to acquire it.
newworld_xiyu_a2_001_2_1_1=I agree. Sow I have no interest in it.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_002_2_1=Well, I might be interested in a trade down the line. If you Lianfang resign from looking for the treasure, perhaps a big deal might be in store for you after I've obtained it.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_002_2_1=We Liangfang are only interested in trade.
newworld_xiyu_a2_002_2_1_1=Wait and see what will happen. <font color="#FF0000">(I can sell my stuff to Lianfang people from now on.)</font>
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_003_2_1=Are you here because of the treasure of Loulan?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_003_2_1=No. The treasure of Loulan belongs to the descendants of Loulan. I advise you not to get involved in this either.
newworld_xiyu_a2_003_2_1_1=I see. <font color="#FF0000">(I can sell my stuff to Lianfang people from now on.)</font>
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_004_2_1=I do not mean to offend but the Western Region is becoming dangerous place due to the recent events. Being that you are just a young girl, aren't you afraid of getting caught up in this?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_004_2_1=My father and I are here for trade. We have no interest in the treasure. I do not feel there will be any issue so long as we are not involved.
newworld_xiyu_a2_004_2_1_1=Of course, you are right.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_005_2_1=Forgive me for asking but are you Scholars here because of the treasure of Loulan?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_005_2_1=You may not believe me but we are here simply to enjoy the beautiful scenery. The treasure is of no interest to us.
newworld_xiyu_a2_005_2_1_1=Awesome! <font color="#FF0000">(I think he lied. They might also be longing for Loulan Treasure.)</font>
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_006_2_1=Have you come due to the treasure of Loulan?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_006_2_1=No, we are here to investigate Heaven Net Cult and if possible, to enjoy the beautiful scenery.
newworld_xiyu_a2_006_2_1_1=I see. (I have never thought Scholars would paid close attention to Heaven Net Cult. Will they covet<a href="item,item_newworld_xiyu_a1_task_004" style="HLStypebuzz"> Heaven Net Cult Saintess's Token</a> and<a href="item,item_newworld_xiyu_a1_task_005" style="HLStypebuzz"> Heaven Net Cult Token</a>?)
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_006_2_5=You look upset. What's wrong?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_006_2_5=It's nothing specific, I just feel upset. I usually calm myself by playing music but I cannot find a partner. Can you play?
newworld_xiyu_a2_006_2_5_1=Yes, I can. It is my honor to play music together with you.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_031_2_3=Are you pursuing the treasure of Loulan?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_031_2_3=Of course not. I prefer training and fighting over treasure hunting.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_031_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>Loulan is basically a thing of the past. It is a good thing if we can make use of the treasure.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_031_3_1=With your strength you couldn't keep the treasure from being taken from you even if you claimed it.
newworld_xiyu_a2_031_3_1_1=You are right.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_031_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>Loulan's treasure belongs to Loulan descendants. If we get involved we'd be no better than thieves.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_031_3_2=Here ! We do not need to steal the possessions of others. Plus I hate thieves!
newworld_xiyu_a2_031_3_2_1=I agree.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_032_2_4=You are a descendent of Loulan. Why do nothing while others fight for Loulan's treasure?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_032_2_4=We Loulan descendants have been scattered all about the Western Region. Even if we find the treasure, do you think we are united enough to re-establish Loulan?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_032_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>The treasure of Loulan belongs to you. With proper use you might be able to re-establish Loulan.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_032_3_1=You are right. We must try, no matter what!
newworld_xiyu_a2_032_3_1_1=I agree.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_032_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>No offense but I am afraid you Loulan descendants are incapable of claiming the treasure. There are just too many trained experts involved now.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_032_3_2=(Sigh) I cannot protect the treasure left by my ancestors! Will we ever see the day when Luolan is re-established...
newworld_xiyu_a2_032_3_2_1=Do not think too much on it.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_032_2_5=Give the <a href="item,item_newworld_xiyu_a1_task_015" style="HLStypebuzz">Loulan Treasure Map</a> to the Barbarian.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_032_2_5=You have the <a href="item,item_newworld_xiyu_a1_task_015" style="HLStypebuzz">Loulan Treasure Map</a>? Incredible! We finally have the chance to re-establish Loulan! You have our deepest gratitude.
newworld_xiyu_a2_032_2_5_1=You are glib. Wanna cheat me out of my treasure? I will give it to you after investigation. (Upgrade your Fame to <font color="#FF0000">Level 15</font> and then try again.）
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_032_2_6=Are you looking for this <a href="item,item_newworld_xiyu_a1_task_009" style="HLStypebuzz">Desert Star</a>?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_032_2_6=Of the treasure, the Desert Stars are the most precious. It is said that when you collect all three Desert Stars, you will uncover great secret; however, no one knows what this secret it is. So you are looking for the Desert Star? Old Curly Beard was boasting about his new treasure, a<font color="#44ff44"> Desert Star Treasure Map Fragment</font>. Try speaking with him.
newworld_xiyu_a2_032_2_6_1=Thank you. I am leaving to find Old Curly Beard now.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_031_2_4=Is this Heaven Net Cult Token of any use to you?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_031_2_4=What? Only skilled experts can get their hands on such a token. You have it? Don't kid me! Go away.
newworld_xiyu_a2_031_2_4_1=Alright, since you don't believe, I will leave. Bye. (Old Curly Beard did not believe me. I have to upgrade Western Regions Reputation to level 6 and Loulan descendent Affinity to level 2 before I visit him again.)
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_033_2_5=Why aren't you involved in this hunt for the treasure of Luolan?
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_033_2_5=Because quite simply, it is of no use to me.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_033_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>If I have the treasure I will use it to improve my skills tenfold. Plus it would garner me more allies.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_033_3_1=Haha, it seems treasure can change anyone.
newworld_xiyu_a2_033_3_1_1=Thank you.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a2_033_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>Loulan's treasure should be used to benefit all the people of the world.
title_newworld_xiyu_a2_033_3_2=Nonsense. Once you see the treasure such thoughts would exit your mind. No one can resist the allure of wealth.

title_newworld_xiyu_a3_001_3_1=I'm sorry but you don't understand the true meaning. While the teacher prepares the apprentice, their skill depends on their own efforts.

menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_001_2_6=Who is Heaven Net Cult Saintess? How can the token be used?
title_newworld_xiyu_a3_001_2_6=Heaven Net Cult scares all the people in the western region. The Saintess is the goddess to the cultists. So her token is very precious. I have a Heaven Net Cult Token, which can summon all cultists. Would you like to exchange Saintess's Token for it?
newworld_xiyu_a3_001_2_6_1=How can I give this precious item to you just like this? (Upgrade your Fame to level 5 and then try again.)
menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_002_2_3=Most Jianghu people are longing to win the Loulan Treasure.
title_newworld_xiyu_a3_002_2_3=I hate greedy people more than anything. Many vile people have been trying to sneak into the Desert Ghost Town. I hope my father is ok. Do you quarrel with your parents?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_002_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>Though Filial Piety is important, I still argue with them at times. Even parents make mistakes.

menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_003_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>The Loulan Treasure Map has become the focus of many leaders from both the Western Region and Central Plains. We should stay out of this affair to protect ourselves and wait for a proper opportunity to resolve the dispute.

newworld_xiyu_a3_003_3_2_1=Awesome.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_004_2_4=Excuse me for asking but aren't you interested in Loulan's treasure?
title_newworld_xiyu_a3_004_2_4=I wish to but I cannot at this time. How does your lord maintain his rule during all this?

title_newworld_xiyu_a3_004_2_5=The Heaven Net Cult Saintess plays an important role. How did you get her token? Is it a fake?
newworld_xiyu_a3_004_2_5_1=Alright, in this case, there is nothing I can do here. (The prince does not believe me. I have to upgrade Western Regions Fame to level 5 and then try again.)
menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_004_2_6=This <a href="item,item_newworld_xiyu_a1_task_009" style="HLStypebuzz">Desert Star</a> is very precious in the western region. Will it be useful to you?
title_newworld_xiyu_a3_004_2_6=The Desert Star is too valuable to show it to me so casually. It must be a fake!

menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_006_2_2=What's your plan for the treasure of Loulan?
title_newworld_xiyu_a3_006_2_2=It doesn't interest me. Recently someone suggested I support the Loulan descendants in claiming the treasure and re-establishing Loulan. You people of the Desert Ghost Town could profit from that endeavor. What do you think of that?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_006_3_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>The Desert Ghost Town is more than capable of claiming the treasure of Loulan by itself. There's no need to work with others.
title_newworld_xiyu_a3_006_3_1=Nonsense. We would gain treasure much easier if we cooperated with the Loulan descendants. By going it alone we will take heavy causalities. Were you too stupid to think of this?
newworld_xiyu_a3_006_3_1_1=Do not get me wrong. That is just what I thought. Believe me.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a3_006_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice: </font>With the help of the Loulan descendants claiming the treasure will be much easier…but can we trust them?

task_newworld_xiyu_a3_007=I am the chosen king! May grandfather bless me to gain the throne.

newworld_xiyu_a2_021_3_2_1=No, no. I just want to be a witness. Then I will never regret.
newworld_xiyu_a2_022_2_1_1=I see. (I am afraid their true purpose is hunting treasure instead of seeking medicine.)

newworld_xiyu_a2_023_2_1_1=All right, all right, I should leave. (I cannot understand why such a gorgeous woman could be so unreasonable.)
newworld_xiyu_a2_023_2_2_1=Why are you so unreasonable? (Why did you snatch my map? Let you know my stealing skill. What's it?)
newworld_xiyu_a2_023_2_3_1=Well, keep it since you need it. I will take the herb with me. (She looks hostile. I'd better leave now.)
newworld_xiyu_a2_023_2_4_1=You are right. I am not sure this map is authentic or not. (She looks hostile. I'd better leave now.)
newworld_xiyu_a2_023_3_1_1=Thank you for your concern. (She is not that cold.)

newworld_xiyu_a2_029_3_1_1=You just lack food. What's the big deal?
newworld_xiyu_a2_029_3_2_1=You poor boy! Hope you will be adopted soon.
newworld_xiyu_a2_030_2_1_1=I see. Money can be placed over good looking.

title_newworld_xiyu_a2_014_2_3=This is the keepsake I gave to Yang Peifeng! Have I wronged him in some way? He is hailed a great hero within the Central Plains, while my reputation as the Palace Leader has become unsavory. How ridiculous! Unjust even!

title_newworld_xiyu_a2_015_2_3=The most widely-spread rumor is that it is the key to unlocking the secret of eternal youth. As you know there are many others but it is impossible to determine which are true. I'm afraid you will not be able to find the Desert Stars with just this map fragment. I fear pursuit of the Desert Stars will only lead to danger.
newworld_xiyu_a2_015_2_3_1=Thank you. Take it easy. I will not show it to others.

title_newworld_xiyu_a1_003_2_6=This is from the Heaven Net Cult. I don’t know where you got it, but I hope you won’t go down the wrong path.

title_newworld_xiyu_a1_004_2_5=Sorry but I do not know where the Loulan Treasury is located. Supposedly the stone key can lead its owner to where the cavern is located.
title_newworld_xiyu_a1_004_2_7=It is an item usually only found in the possession of Heaven Net Cult members. Best to hold onto it. It could come in handy. The Loulan descendants have lived in the Western Region for generations. They can give you more information.

title_newworld_xiyu_a1_010_2_6=You must be incredibly skilled to have gotten this map. Don't tell anyone else you have this or you could lose your life.
title_newworld_xiyu_a1_011_2_1=I don't think myself lucky enough to be the one to come out on top with the treasure. I'm here to research this language...unfortunately I've made little progress.

menu_newworld_xiyu_a1_011_3_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice:</font> Befriend those who don't offend you. Those that do are your enemy.
title_newworld_xiyu_a1_011_3_2=That's absurd. If I offend you unintentionally, will you also consider me an enemy?
menu_newworld_xiyu_a1_011_2_3=Can you tell me anything about this <a href="item,item_newworld_xiyu_a1_task_004" style="HLStypebuzz">Token</a>?

title_newworld_xiyu_a1_013_2_1=We are just merchants from Lianfang. We are not here for the treasure. Even if we were, we lack the skills to obtain it. We just wish to earn money though exchanging items.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a1_013_2_2=Nice to see you again.

title_newworld_xiyu_a1_013_2_5=The map is used to guide one to Gold Centipede Cave. With the Celestial Centipede's Pearl you will be immune to the poison from the insects in the cave. That said, even with those it is still very dangerous. If you don't feel up to the task, you could always trade them for more worthwhile items.
menu_newworld_xiyu_a1_013_3_5=<font color="#FFAE00">Choice:</font> I choose Box A.

title_newworld_xiyu_yd_001_1_1=You must be new here. The Western Region has become dangerous and all factions engaged in a bitter struggle.
menu_newworld_xiyu_yd_001_2_1=What bitter struggle?
title_newworld_xiyu_yd_001_2_1=Well, I'd better tell you as your ignorance could cost you. The Loulan State, have you heard of it?
menu_newworld_xiyu_yd_001_3_1=Yes. It was a mysterious and flourishing state in the western region. But it periwarehouse suddenly.
title_newworld_xiyu_yd_001_3_1=Right. In fact, these factions are ready for Loulan Treasure. They are contending for Loulan Treasure Map Fragments now. Loulan Treasure is said to have countless treasure, peerless weapons and ultimate scripts. With it, the winner may even overthrow the government and establish a new one.
menu_newworld_xiyu_yd_001_4_1=Oh my God! There must be high casualties here. Could you tell me which factions get involved?
title_newworld_xiyu_yd_001_4_1=Nearly all the factions in the Western Regions get involved. They are Loulan descendents, Western Xia descendents, Heaven Net Cult, Desert Ghost Town, Qiuci and Shi Guanyin. The eight schools of the central plains also get involved. Look, that is the duel between those two regions, the Western Regions and the central plains.
menu_newworld_xiyu_yd_001_5_1=Why are they fighting here?
title_newworld_xiyu_yd_001_5_1=You want to get involved? Consider it carefully. Whatever, they are fighting for Desert Stars! These three Desert Stars can help find out the secret of Loulan Treasure Map. Hey, you look weak. Do you have a cold?
menu_newworld_xiyu_yd_001_6_1=Yes, I do. I cannot get used to the climate here.
title_newworld_xiyu_yd_001_6_1=I see. The climate in the Western Regions is quite different from that in the central plains.The coldness in the grassland, heat in desert, or lack of water or food may kill you here. Do pay attention to your own health situation. Then you can explore here more efficiently. Here is the medicine. Take it. You will feel better.
newworld_xiyu_yd_001_6_1_1=Thank you for helping. Thank you.
menu_newworld_xiyu_yd_001_2_2=Thank you. I feel much better.
title_newworld_xiyu_yd_001_2_2=Always pay attention to your health when traveling in the Western Region. Beyond the grassland is nothing but desert. Now that you are well, do not miss out on the duel. Which side will you choose?
newworld_xiyu_yd_001_2_2_1=I'm from the central plains. Surely I'll join it.
newworld_xiyu_yd_001_2_2_2=I'm tired of the intrigues in the Wulin world of the central plains. I'll join the Western Regions alignment.
newworld_xiyu_yd_001_2_2_3=The situation is complicated. I'd better keep away from it.

newworld_xiyu_a2_034_2_9_1=Deal.
newworld_xiyu_a1_001_2_3_1=I see. Bye. (Mu Dieyin doesn't believe you.You have to ask for more information to win her trust.)
newworld_xiyu_a1_001_2_6_1=I am sorry. Mu Dieyin is indifferent. I'm afraid no one can get some information on Desert Ghost Town unless they are her acquaintances.
title_xiyu_a1_001_1-7a=If the treasure is occupied by the vile people, it might be a disaster to the society. I'm afraid you don't have enough power to keep it. You will be preyed because of it. So why don't you give it to me?
xiyu_a1_001_1-7a=You are right. Here you are. (Emei must have some plan on the treasure. I have no choice but give it to her. I will find ways to get it back.)
title_xiyu_a1_001_1-8a=Loulan Treasure matters a lot. It's complicated in the western region. Jiugong Elder is the leader of justice alignment. You can ask him to keep it for you. Consider it please.

title_xiyu_a1_003_1-9a=You devious and malevolent guy! I will never allow the Desert Star to fall into your hands.

menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_2_5=Your trick does not work on me. We all know that the Northern Highlands people are sly.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_2_5=This bounty on Tian Xi…is that why all of you are here? Makes no difference to me, though.
newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_2_5_1=Whatever you say.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_1_1=Is this a dangerous place? I can't really tell.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_1_1=It's the people here who are dangerous.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_2_1=Indeed. Thanks for the tip.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_2_1=I can't really talk to you right now. I'm busy collecting herbs.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_3_1=Need my help? I know a little something about herbs.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_3_1=Thanks, but I'm good. Since you're nice, let me warn you about a devil who lives here. He catches people to test his medicine. Be careful.
newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_3_1_1=Thank you for the warning.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_2_2=You certainly know your way around this swamp, don't you? I'm impressed.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_2_2=Yeah, so?
newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_2_2_1=I've been having a miserable time ever since I came to the Northern Plains. I'm glad to have met someone like you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_3_2=(The kid must have some special skills, or he could not survive in the Northern Highlands by himself.) I've lived a miserable life since I arrived at the Northern Highlands. I am so happy that I meet you here.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_3_2=Here's some food for you, you look like you need it. Beware of the devil that lives here. He captures people and tests his medicine on them.
newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_3_2_1=Thank you. I'm leaving.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_2_3=I've been looking for Tian Xi. I just can't seem to get anywhere.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_2_3=So, you're looking for her, too. Last I heard, she's on her way to the Divine Water Palace.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_3_3=Really?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_3_3=Believe me or not, it's up to you. I'll say this much: If you insist on catching this Tian Xi, the Blackpool Devil will be but one of your many worries.
newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_3_3_1=Thank you. I'm leaving.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_1_1=Forgive me, I don't mean to intrude.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_1_1=No bother, I was just getting bored, anyway. Tell me, why have you come to the Northern Plains?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_2_1=I've been investigating the murder at Lord Qin's Residence. I discovered that it is connected with the destruction of Ice Spirit Castle eight years ago.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_2_1=So, it's a mystery within a mystery. What leads do you have?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_3_1=I can only say this Twin Fish Jade Pendant is proof of a greater conspiracy.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_3_1=So, tell me what you know.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_4_1=The Plague Lady, owner of Twin Fish Jade Pendant, was betrayed by a man she loved. In her anger, she created the Scourge, which would wipe out the man's entire home town. This Twin Fish Jade Pendant is a ward against the Scourge. It's a good to know that she no longer intends to unleash her deadly poison.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_4_1=This Twin Fish Jade Pendant sounds very useful. Would you like to exchange it for my Lady's Portrait? He he, it really deserves a closer look…
newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_4_1_1=It is a lovely painting…very well, you've got yourself a deal.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_4_1_2=(He doesn't want to give it to you now. Upgrade your reputation to <font color="#FF0000">Level 11</font> and then try again.)
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_3_2=There isn't much more to tell. I better be going now, before my trail goes cold.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_3_2=Tell me more! I'll fight you if you don't.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_3_2_1=Sorry, another time.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_2_2=I'd be more willing to share what I know, if you would do the same.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_2_2=That attitude won't get you anywhere. This is the Northern Plains. You're the one who needs all the help you can get.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_2_2_1=If we have nothing more to discuss, then I will take your leave.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_1_1=I'm sorry to see you so upset. Is there anything I can do for you?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_1_1=It's a long story, but it is all the past now, where it belongs.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_1=Please tell me your story. Take your time.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_1=I have been haunted by guilt and regret for eight years.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_3_1=So many lives are affected by what happened that day eight years ago. We must all go on with our lives.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_3_1=Eight years ago, my wife and I visited Ice Spirit Castle. The place was overrun with assassins, and I saw my wife killed along with the rest of them. How I hate myself! I couldn't even defend her.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_4_1=Let the past stay in the past. You should move on.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_4_1=How can I move on without avenging her? However, I do not even know whom to blame. The Myriad Weave Red Net is the only thing she left to me, and it's still stained with her blood.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_5_1=Would you be willing to give it me? I'll use it for good, in memory of your wife.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_5_1=Yes, perhaps it's for the best.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_5_1_1=This is Half Moon, a potent poison. It is said to be connected to Ice Spirit Castle. Please accept this in exchange.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_5_1_2=(He doesn't want to give it to you now. Upgrade your reputation to <font color="#FF0000">Level 4</font> and then try again.)
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_3_2=I still have pressing matters at hand. Farewell.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_3_2=Sigh…you may go now.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_3_2_1=I'm going.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_2=Tell me everything. They say confession is good for the soul.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_2=It is because of my cowardice that my wife died right in front of me. It's all my fault.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_3_3=Did you avenge her?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_3_3=I cannot find the murder.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_3_3_1=Why are you here feeling sorry for yourself? You should go out there and seek vengeance!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_3=You can stop now. I'm sorry it has brought you back so much pain.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_3=No one can understand me now. What happened that day…does anyone still remember what happened that day…
newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_3_1=I should go.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_1_1=May I ask you something?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_1_1=Go ahead, speak.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_1=I'm new to the Northern Plains. Even though I have a map, I am still lost.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_1=Map? Are you here for the bounty?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_3_1=Yes, I do. I cannot say no to such a rich bounty. <font color="#FFAE00">(Following the sinister path will earn you affinity from the sinister factions.)</font>
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_3_1=Finally, an honest person. Well, let me tell you, the map you have is a forgery. That's why it's not getting you anywhere. I have a secret letter from Lord Qin. If you're willing to serve him, you can get it.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_3_1_1=Thank you very much.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_3_2=You misunderstood me. I'm just here to see what's going on.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_3_2=So you're just another traveler? Then I have nothing to say to you. Be gone!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_3_2_1=Um……
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_1_1=I see. You must have been cheated.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_1_1=I can create the most sophisticated devices, but I don't know how women think.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_1=To know a woman's thoughts is like finding a needle at the bottom of the ocean. It's better if we focus on the matter with Lord Qin, particularly the legendary martial arts script he's after.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_1=Martial art scripts mean nothing to me. It doesn't matter if you're sent by Lord Qin or the Changfeng Agency, I know you're just here for my Arrow of Gratitude.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_3_1=Would you like my Essence of Caducity? I know you are looking for it.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_3_1=Yes, I need it to get an answer from a woman.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_3_1_1=Then we have a fair trade.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_3_2=You are so direct, I do not know what to say.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_3_2=Then say nothing. Go back to where you came from!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_3_2_1=Wait, please listen to me…
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_2=If you feel cheated, you're not alone. The people of the Northern Plains can be quite treacherous indeed, and I've learned that lesson the hard way.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_2=What you say is true, but it will only make me trust you all the less. You are here at this Nameless Cave of mine, so please don't tell me you're just passing by.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_2_1=If that's the way you feel, then I should leave.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_3=I need shelter for the night. May I stay here at this cave?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_3=You're asking for much.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_3_1=Such a big cave, and you won't even share.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_1_1=Are you Xiao Lingdang? The one that ran way from home?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_1_1=It's none of your business.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_1=Kids should be polite. Your grandpa is worried sick about you.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_1=I'm really in trouble this time. Wait, is that a White Jade Hairpin? I once saw it in my Grandpa's house. Did you steal it?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_3_1=No, I didn't steal it. What does it have to do with your grandpa? I heard it belonged to Old Lady Qin herself.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_3_1=Can you give that White Jade Hairpin to me? I really want it. I'll trade you with my Twin Fish Jade Pendant, it's a powerful ward against all kinds of poisons! Please, can we trade? Please?
newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_3_1_1=Sure, why not. I don't really know what's so important about that hairpin, anyway.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_3_1_2=... (He doesn't want to give it to you now. Upgrade your Fame to <font color="#FF0000">Level 10</font> and then try again.)
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_3_2=You really should learn some manners. I'm done talking to you.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_3_2=You're mad, aren't you?
newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_3_2_1=I said, I'm done talking to you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_1_1=Excuse me. May I know why you have retired to this place?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_1_1=Curiosity is a dangerous thing.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_1=I've heard the Changbai Sect is friendly and helpful.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_1=We are just the branch of Changbai Sect, and yes, they have a good reputation now. But it's best if we speak no more about them.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_3_1=What happened to your people? Can you tell me?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_3_1=If you must know, we were used. Then we had to live in the frigid Northern Plains because of a disease we've contracted. Did you get this Golden Skull from Killers' Manor? Can you let me have it?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_4_1=I seek the Ghost Mask. I need it to infiltrate the Demon's Gang and continue my investigation.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_4_1=Today is your lucky day. I have the Ghost Mask.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_4_1_1=Great!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_3_2=You sound so bitter. Have you been sent into exile because you fought for the sect's leadership…
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_3_2=You presumptuous fool. I was never interested in leading our sect!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_3_2_1=I apologize, it was but a guess.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_2=I am here to solve a murder mystery. If I weren't so curious, I wouldn't get anywhere.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_2=You're here because of the murder at Lord Qin's residence? Then I have nothing to say to you. Please leave.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_2_1=From the way you just reacted, I think you do. Please, you can tell me, I only want to know the truth.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_3=I am here to solve the case. I'm afraid I can never solve it without curiosity.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_3=Let's just say things are not what they seem. Take my advice, if you don’t want to die young, or end up the way I am now, you should just mind your own business and go.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_3_1=Thank you for your concern.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_4=I respect the Changbai Sect. They are martial art experts, and yet they always do what's right, and never take advantage of the weak.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_4=It shames me to hear you say that. I hope I can atone for my sins…
newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_4_1=Sir, I don't understand…
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_5=I am a fan of Changbai Sect. Changbai Sect is rich in experts and never bullies common people.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_5=What do you know? Are you trying to humiliate me? Go! Get out of my sight!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_2_5_1=I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend you…
newworld_beiyuan_a2_007_4_1_2=(Upgrade your reputation in the Northern Plains to <font color="#FF0000">Level 8</font> and then talk with him.)
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_008_1_1=Excuse me. Where am I?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_008_1_1=You're in Changbai Sect territory. What do you want?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_008_2_1=Tian Xi, the prime suspect in the Lord Qin Residence murder case, has fled to the Northern Plains. I'm here to investigate. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_008_2_1=Yes, you need all the help you can get.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_008_3_1=What are you suggesting? <font color="#FFAE00">(Following the sinister path will earn you affinity from the sinister factions.)</font>
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_008_3_1=The map on the Northern Plains is a forgery, it will lead you nowhere. This secret letter from Lord Qin would be much more helpful.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_008_3_1_1=So I have the wrong map all along. Thank you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_008_3_2=I was only being polite. It's not a big deal.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_008_3_2=Suit yourself.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_008_3_2_1=You really think you are a big deal, don't you?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_1_1=It's an honor to meet you.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_1_1=Spare me the pleasantries. Just tell me how you'd like to die.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_2_1=I don't want to die! I would never enter Killers' Manor, even if I knew where it was.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_2_1=It's too late for you now. Die!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_2_1_1=Aaarrgh!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_2_2=I have an urgent matter which requires your assistance. I'm no good to you dead.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_2_2=What good are you to me?
newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_2_2_1=I can be very useful.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_2_3=I've always wanted to visit you. I cannot express just how deep my admiration is for you.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_2_3=Your flattery means nothing. Leave!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_2_3_1=Right away!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_2_4=I have heard a lot about you and your faction. You do not disappoint me.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_2_4=You think you're talking to a child? Leave or I'll have your head removed where you stand!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_009_2_4_1=Very well, I'm leaving.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_1_1=What a lovely cat you have, my lady.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_1_1=Have you come all the way here just for my cat?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_2_1=I heard that you were looking for an item. One that I have.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_2_1=So, you're well informed. Tell me, what is this item I'm looking for?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_3_1=White Jade Hairpin.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_3_1=That's right. It may be just an ordinary hairpin, but it did once belong to none other than the Plague Lady herself. Give it to me.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_4_1=I cannot just give it to you, but I'm willing to make a trade. Do you still have the Essence of Caducity?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_4_1=Let me think about it. (She finishes her tea.) Very well, let's trade.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_4_1_1=Excellent.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_3_2=All in good time. Do you have the Essence of Caducity?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_3_2=What's it to you? Get out!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_3_2_1=Well, at least you don't know what I have.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_4_1_2=(Upgrade your reputation in the Northern Plains to <font color="#FF0000">Level 10</font> and then talk with her.)
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_3_3=Not at all, but I would appreciate some information, since you are so well informed. Can you tell me what you know about the murder at Lord Qin's residence?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_3_3=I don't have much to say, but you should already know this is not just a simple murder case. As it unravels, hidden truths are slowly making themselves known.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_3_3_1=Thank you for your comment.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_2_3=Of course not. You are well informed. Could you give me some idea about the murder case in Lord Qin's Residence?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_2_3=I will not discuss this with you. Leave now.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_010_2_3_1=Sorry to bother you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_1_1=Excuse me. I have something to ask you.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_1_1=What is it?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_2_1=Are you familiar with the murder at Lord Qin Residence? The Changfeng Escort Agency and Lord Qin's Residence are now at odds over this case. The only way to resolve the crisis is to find Tian Xi and uncover the truth.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_2_1=I see.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_3_1=You've seen things going on around here. What's your take of all this? <font color="#FFAE00">(Following the sinister path will earn you affinity from the sinister factions.)</font>
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_3_1=I have a secret message from Lord Qin's Residence. If you want to find the truth, you have to go to the Northern Plains with it. The map in your hand is useless there.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_3_1_1=Thank you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_3_2=So you're on the case, too? Did you help Tian Xi in the Northern Plains?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_3_2=You think too much. I no longer wish to talk to you.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_3_2_1=Perhaps I should keep more of my thoughts to myself…
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_2_2=Please don't leave so soon. Consider it good luck that has brought us to this meeting here in this vast Northern Plains.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_2_2=It's luck if we meet elsewhere. Northern Plains is a place where you kill or be killed.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_3_3=Your ability decides whether you will kill or be killed. I will not enter the Northern Plains if I am not confident in my ability.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_3_3=Confident, are you? Then watch your back. Not all blows come straight in front of you.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_3_3_1=I see. Thanks for the advice.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_2_3=Come on. It's affinity that we meet here in the Northern Highlands.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_2_3=Luck has nothing to do with this. You're no concern of mine.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_011_2_3_1=Please, you're not making this easy.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_012_1_1=Tough luck.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_012_1_1=Who said that? If you have something to say, say it in my face!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_012_2_1=You've been on a losing streak. If I don't know better, I'd say you're the infamous Gambler of the Demon's Gang.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_012_2_1=So you've heard of me. Care to make a wager?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_012_3_1=Fine, but we have to wager something. I'll put up the map of the Northern Plains. What about you?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_012_3_1=I have some sort of secret letter, I heard it's rather useful. Let's play two rounds of dice.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_012_4_1=<font color="#FFAE00">Option:</font> I bet high. <font color="#FFAE00">(Following the sinister path will earn you affinity from the sinister factions.)</font>
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_012_4_1=Fine, I bet low.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_012_4_1_1=Let's begin.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_012_4_2=<font color="#FFAE00">Option:</font> I bet low. <font color="#FFAE00">(Following the sinister path will earn you affinity from the sinister factions.)</font>
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_012_4_2=All right, I bet high.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_012_4_2_1=Open it.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_4_2a=Since we're being honest to each other, let me continue. Lord Qin, and a group of mysterious people clad in black, stand to benefit from capturing Tian Xi. Those people are  after a piece of tattooed human skin, which I have in my backpack.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_4_2a=I am very interested in this Tattooed Skin of yours, and I hear that you've been looking for a Golden Skull, which I happen to have. I believe a fair trade is in order.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_4_2_1a=Sure, why not.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_023_2_3x=Where there's a will, there's a way. The end always justifies the means.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a3_006_2_3x=We have no interest in speaking with you. Please leave.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_013_1_1=Trick? What trick?

title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_1_1=Why are you here in the Northern Plains?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_2_1=I place myself at the service of the Changfeng Escort Agency. I wish to prove Tian Xi's innocence.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_2_1=Thank you. We feel sorry for the death of Old Lady Qin. But we cannot admit that it has something to do with us unless there is evidence.

menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_3_2=What will the Changfeng Escort Agency do if Tian Xi is guilty?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_3_2=Perish the thought! Tian Xi is innocent!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_3_2_1=Very well. I'll take your leave now.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_2_2=We must solve this mystery, in the name of justice.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_2_2=If only it can be as easily said and done! Many days have gone by, and we still have not found Tian Xi. So many are now after her bounty. I am really worried.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_3_3=We need to uncover the truth as soon as possible. I have the Brilliant Sword, which belongs to one of the people involved in the decimation of the Ice Spirit Castle eight years ago.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_3_3=Ice Spirit Castle...Tian Xi just won't let it go. You see, she is not only the third lady of Changfeng Escort Agency but also the eldest daughter of Ice Spirit Castle. Bringing those who slaughtered her family to justice has been her lifelong ambition.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_4_1=You did not have to test me, but I understand.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_4_1=I, too, have a piece of evidence. It's a poison called Half Moon, supposedly belonging to Lord Qin himself. May I trade it for your Brilliant Sword? It may bring Tian Xi back to us.

menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_014_4_2=You don't really have the martial arts script, do you? You're just looking after your own interests, like everyone else.

menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_1_1=What's the matter?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_1_1=Have you seen my granddaughter? Her name is Xiao Lingdang. She ran away from home after we had an argument.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_2_1=Xiao Lingdang? That name... If I see her I will mention that you are looking for her.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_2_1=Thank you. I will reward you if you find her.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_3_1=That's very nice of you. The Northern Plains are dangerous. We would do well to help each other.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_3_1=Do you have a problem?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_4_1=I came to the Northern Plains to follow a lead on the murder at Lord Qin's Residence. Unfortunately, I still have a long way to go before ever solving the case. All I've got is this Half Moon.

menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_5_1=Really?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_5_1=To be honest, I've heard of Lord Qin's Residence murder case. It's not simple at all. The Half Moon in your hands is from Lord Qin's Residence. You have to exchange it for Myriad Weave Red Net if you want to solve the case. I'd like to help you if you help me find my granddaughter.

title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_3_2=I'll give you some food, if you tell me what you know.
newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_3_2_1=Thank you. The girl's name is Xiao Lingdang. She was last seen at the Nameless Cave. I'm not sure if she's still there?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_2_3=You still haven't found her?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_2_3=No. Some say that she appeared in the Nameless Cave. But when I went there, she was gone. I will give White Jade Hairpin to anyone who can help me find her.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_3_3=What's so important about this White Jade Hairpin?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_3_3=Ah, that. You see, that has something to do with the business with Lord Qin's Residence and the Changfeng Agency. There's a murder, and this Tian Xi woman is the prime suspect. Do you know whom she has allegedly killed?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_4_2=Are you saying it wasn't Old Lady Qin who was killed?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_4_2=That's why the White Jade Hairpin is so important. Tian Xi escaped from Lord Qin's Residence with this White Jade Hairpin. It is made of ordinary material. Is it possible that Old Lady Qin would wear something so common on her birthday?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_5_3=That sounds suspicious.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_5_3=I heard that Xiao Lingdang appeared in Demon's Gang. That's why I need your Ghost Mask.
newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_5_3_1=Sounds fair. Here you go.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_3_4=What does a mere hairpin have to do with all that? Are you trying to trick me?

menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_2_4=Sorry, I haven't found Xiao Lingdang.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_2_4=I have to find her quickly. Something is going to happen in the Northern Plains.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_3_5=Do you know something?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_001_3_5=I've seen Lord Qin secretly leading his men to the Northern Plains. Things must be getting complicated.

title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_1_1=Save the polite act. What do you want?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_2_1=I'm here regarding the Lord Qin Residence murder case. Do you know anything about it?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_2_1=Yes. I've heard something about it. I give out Longmen Token to heroes who come to the Northern Plains for Changfeng Escort Agency. Anyone who can find Tian Xi will be rewarded with an ancient manual.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_3_1=Oh, you will? How nice.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_3_1=Not everyone can get a Longmen Token. You have to exchange something for it.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_4_1=I only have a map of Northern Plains. <font color="#FFAE00">(Following the righteous path will earn you affinity from the righteous factions.)</font>
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_4_1=A map? That'll do. My brother's granddaughter is lost in the Northern Plains. That map may help.
newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_4_1_1=Thank you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_4_2=I don't have anything to exchange with you. Please, just give me a Longmen Token so I can find Tian Xi for the Changfeng Escort Agency.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_4_2=You can't just beg for a Longmen Token. Go away.
newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_4_2_1=Please, a moment of your time...
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_2_2=Tian Xi from Changfeng Escort Agency is missing. Do you know anything about it?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_2_2=No. The weather is bad here in the Northern Plains, and its people are even worse. Your girl is probably dead by now, so don't waste your time.
newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_2_2_1=Sorry to bother you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_2_3=Have you noticed the unrest here?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_2_3=Of course. Everyone here knows. The East Chamber is here, so you know things aren't as they seem. Why don't you just mind your own business and leave?

text_newworld_beiyuan_jy_053_2=Lady still hasn't let the grudge go after so many years. There's an catastrophe coming to Yanjing soon.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_053_2=By catastrophe you mean?
text_newworld_beiyuan_jy_053_4001=Hush. Both of us will die if the lady knows.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_053_4001=Ok.
text_newworld_beiyuan_jy_053_4002=Eight years ago, we escorted the injured lady to the Northern Plains. Besides healing herself, another important thing to her is revenge. Now lady has refined the Scourge. I'm afraid that there will be corpses everywhere in Yanjing.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_053_4002=That is too much. I have to stop it.

menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_003_4002=The citizens of Yanjing have done you no wrong. Why should they suffer because of a stranger?

title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_01=(The horse casually glances at you)
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_02=It's none of your business.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_03=I just want to do what I have to do. I must atone.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_04=Why are you here again?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_05=You're but a stranger. Who gives you the right to ask me about the truth?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_06=I don't care who sent you. Strangers cannot meddle in Phantom's Mountain Manor's affairs. Leave. You are as disgusting as Ding Mang.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_07=Go ahead, say what's on your mind.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_08=(The horse casually glances at you)
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_09=Really?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_10=Think whatever you like.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_11=So, I was the ghost. It's hardly a secret by now.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_12=(Han Xue's expression changes, but says nothing.)
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_13=You...
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_14=(Han Xue remains silent.)
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_15=You won't find her.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_16=Is that true?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_17=So, there is no escape for her…what should we do?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_18=I...I thought you were sent by Changfeng Agency to catch her for Lord Qin.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_19=On that day…my dad was drinking and lamenting about our mother. My sister and I were cleaning the dishes.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_20=He wasn't there, so he knew nothing. When my sister and I were about to go to sleep, we saw a white shadow outside. I chased it but lost it in the woods. I kept looking just outside our home, and that was when I found Tian Xi.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_21=I didn't expect to learn the secret of my mother's death. Eight years ago, my father took my mother to a party but returned several days later with her ashes. Tian Xi told me that they were at the Ice Spirit Castle, on the night assassins in black came to exterminate them all, including all their guests. My mother saved a little girl, but was killed along with everyone else...everyone else except that girl and my father, who hid in a corner and watched my mother die. By now, you should know who that girl was.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_22=I hate him for being such a coward. To this day, Tian Xi wanted to know who destroyed her family, and so do I.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_23=Tian Xi said one of the assassins wielded twin swords. One of them was lost in the mayhem at Ice Spirit Castle, until my father found it and brought it back here to Phantom Mountain's Manor. It was called the Brilliant Sword, and Tian Xi recognized it instantly. I didn't want Ding Mang to suspect the truth, so I got my sister out of the way by sedating her tea, while pretending to take interest in him.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_24=Yes. Tian Xi was using a snow condor, which is exclusive to Ice Spirit Castle. She trained it to fly with a white coat. That was why I could never catch its trail.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_25=Yes.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_26=When I went to my father's house dressed as the ghost, I heard him talking in his sleep, confessing his guilt of not helping my mother in order to save himself. I was so angry, I stabbed him with my dagger.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_27=She ran away. She probably never expected that I would attack my father.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_28=It's still in my father's room.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_29=That's the story, more or less.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_30=She is smart enough to protect herself.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_31=(The horse casually glances at you)
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_32=It's none of your business.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_33=Now that the truth is in the open, I no longer care what part you have in any of this.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_34=Sex slave? Who told you that? It had to be Ding Mang. What a bastard.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_35=(The horse casually glances at you)
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_36=There is no one in the hut. You may collect up to five pieces of evidence and place them in your backpack.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_37=What is it?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_38=(The horse casually glances at you)
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_39=Think whatever you like.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_40=I am the ghost.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_41=What is it that you want?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_42=(Shocked, saying nothing)
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_43=You...
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_44=(Saying nothing)
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_45=You won't find her.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_46=Really?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_47=Don't lie to me. She didn't seem poisoned to me.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_48=Half Moon...I've heard of it. Tian Xi is in danger!
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_49=But...how do I know if you are going to hurt her or not?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_50=Very well, I'll tell you what happened that night. When my sister and I were about to go to sleep, we saw a white shadow outside. I chased it but lost it in the woods. I kept looking just outside our home, and that was when I found Tian Xi.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_51=I didn't expect to learn the secret of my mother's death. Eight years ago, my father took my mother to a party but returned several days later with her ashes. Tian Xi told me that they were at the Ice Spirit Castle, on the night assassins in black came to exterminate them all, including all their guests. My mother saved a little girl, but was killed along with everyone else...everyone else except that girl and my father, who hid in a corner and watched my mother die. By now, you should know who that girl was.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_52=I hate him for being so coward. He may have saved my mother if he was more brave. Tian Xi was the kid who was saved by my mother. She always wanted to find out the mysterious people. So did I.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_53=Tian Xi said one of the assassins wielded twin swords. One of them was lost in the mayhem at Ice Spirit Castle, until my father found it and brought it back here to Phantom Mountain's Manor. It was called the Brilliant Sword, and Tian Xi recognized it instantly. I didn't want Ding Mang to suspect the truth, so I got my sister out of the way by sedating her tea, while pretending to take interest in him.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_54=Yes. Tian Xi was using a snow condor which is exclusive to Ice Spirit Castle. She asked it to fly with a white coat. When I chased it to the forest, it was missing because it landed on the ground at that time.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_55=Yes.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_56=When I dressed up as a ghost and got close to my father's room, I heard that he said he didn't help my injured mother on purpose because he was afraid that mysterious person would kill him. I was so angry that I stabbed him with a dagger.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_57=Ran away with scare. She probably didn't think that I would kill my father.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_58=It's still in my father's room.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_59=You are right.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_60=She is smart enough to protect herself.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_01=I don't know what you are hiding, but I'm sure it's no simple matter.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_02=I don't mean to meddle, but I don't like to see a pretty young woman being misunderstood by her father.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_03=Atonement? What have you done that you must atone? Or are atoning for someone else, like your father…
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_04=The best way to atone is to tell the truth.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_05=I was sent by the Changfeng Agency to find Tian Xi. This Longmen Token is proof. You can trust me.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_06=Then perhaps I should meet this Ding Mang. Farewell.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_07=I have something that will interest you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_08=The shoes were worn by a lady. There is also sedative in the teacup which you poured water from for your sister. More importantly, you told Ding Mang that Han Ruogu treated you like a concubine.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_09=A pathetic lie. I've spoken with Han Ruogu and your sister Han Ling. If you were his concubine, he would never allow you to live with Han Ling. You lied to Ding Mang in order to get his help.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_10=The broken porcelain pillow was an interesting clue, but what was even more important was the ghost costume.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_11=I believe the following evidence should speak for itself.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_11_1=Submit teacup (Submitting wrong item will result in up to a 20% reduction in HP)
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_11_2=Submit package (Submitting wrong item will result in up to a 20% reduction in HP)
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_11_3=Submit bloodstain (Submitting wrong item will result in up to a 20% reduction in HP)
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_11_4=Submit shoes (Submitting wrong item will result in up to a 20% reduction in HP)
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_11_5=Submit box (Submitting wrong item will result in up to a 20% reduction in HP)
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_11_6=Submit incense sachet (Submitting wrong item will result in up to a 20% reduction in HP)
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_12=Han Ling also said that the rouge scent on the men's shoes is from the Fuxiang Room in the capital. Only a rich family could afford to use it. The one masquerading the ghost was none other than Tian Xi herself!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_13=Tian Xi was suspected of killing Old Lady Qin on October 6th. Two days later, she came to the Northern Plains to see you, for reasons I do not yet quite understand.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_14=Where is Tian Xi now?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_15=I may not find her now, but Lord Qin has put such a high bounty on her, there is nowhere for her to go.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_16=You know this as well as I do. Those bounty hunters won't stop until they have her.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_17=If you tell me what you know I may be able to save her.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_18=Master Di Ling only asked me to bring her back safely, and to prove her innocence. I cannot accomplish that by turning her to Lord Qin.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_19=Where was Ding Mang?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_20=What did she say?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_21=I'm sorry for your loss.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_22=So you chose to help Tian Xi.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_23=So, it was Tian Xi who masqueraded as the ghost the first time, but after that, you took her place.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_24=So, one of you played ghost as a distraction, while the other looked for the sword.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_25=Why did you try to kill your father?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_26=And that's how you got caught. What about Tian Xi?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_27=Where is the Brilliant Sword now?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_28=I don't think you really want to kill Kan Ruogu, as you still call him father. You just feel he should be held responsible for your mother's death and seek your forgiveness. However, he chose to hide the truth. When you were caught, you were so disappointed that you wanted to die.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_29=Why don't you talk to Han Ruogu? He is now full of guilt and regret. Have you thought about your sister? Who will protect her if both of you die? Ding Mang?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_30=Do you really think so?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_31=You don't need to say anything. The look in your eyes reveal all.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_32=I don't mean to be meddlesome…I just have an interest in this case.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_33=Why would a daughter kill her father and then make up a story about being his…sex slave?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_34=It's how that bastard thinks, and he almost convinced me. But why did you lie to him? What are you hiding? I am not as stupid as Ding Mang, so don't lie to me!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_35=Your attitude toward Han Ruogu has changed. Something must have happened.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_36=
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_37=I have something that you will be interested in.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_38=The shoes were worn by a lady. There is also sedative in the teacup you used to serve tea to your sister. You are hiding something from her.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_39=I found a more interesting thing in the porcelain pillow. The pillow was split in half instead of falling to half. More importantly, I found the ghost costume in the closet.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_40=I believe the following evidence should speak for itself.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_41=This is the birthday gift you gave to your sister. Han Ling said that the ghost first appeared on October 8, the day you were celebrating your birthday with your father and sister. You wouldn't have been able to pose as the ghost on that day.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_42=Han Ling also said that the rouge scent on the men's shoes is from the Fuxiang Room in the capital. Only rich families can afford that luxury. That means on that day. the ghost was Tian Xi.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_43=Tian Xi was suspected of killing Old Lady Qin on October 6. She came to the Northern Highlands and met you on October 8. But I don't understand why you help her.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_44=Where is Tian Xi now?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_45=It doesn't matter if I can find her right now. The important thing is whether she can be  safe.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_46=Tian Xi was poisoned before she escaped from Lord Qin's Residence.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_47=Half Moon is colorless, odorless, and unrecognizable to the untrained eye. After half a month, the victim dies. I'm afraid Tian Xi doesn't have much time left.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_48=Therefore, tell me what you know. I may save her in time.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_49=If I want to hurt her, then nothing more is required. She will die in half a month.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_50=What did she say?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_51=Sorry for your loss.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_52=Therefore, you choose to help Tian Xi.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_53=The first ghost was Tian Xi? And the next are all you?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_54=So, one of you dressed up as a ghost and the other one looked for blade?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_55=Why did you kill your father?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_56=So you got caught. What about Tian Xi?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_57=Where is Yao Blade?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_58=I don't think you really want to kill Kan Ruogu as you still call him father now. You just think he should be responsible for your mother's death and tell the truth to gain your forgiveness. However, he chose to hide the truth. When you were caught, you were so disappointed that you just wanted to die.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_59=Why don't you talk to Han Ruogu? He has been torturing by pain and regret. And now you are going to kill him. Have you considered your sister? Who will protect her if both of you die? Ding Mang?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_60=Do you really think so?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_01=It's a long story. I was stabbed yesterday by my very own daughter, my sweet little girl! She also admitted that she went through all that pretense with the ghost, so that she could kill me. How could this be?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_02=Aside from her saying she wanted to kill me, she spoke not another word.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_03=Several days ago, there was a ghost appearing in the manor, and things were moved around. Because there had never been strangers visiting the Phantom's Mountain, we assumed it was supernatural.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_04=What else is there to believe? The only thing I know is that my own precious daughter wants to kill me.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_05=Fine, I'll give you three days. Then we'll decide her fate.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_06=So, what did you find out?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_07=Deal? What do you want from me?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_08=How...do you know I have it?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_09=So the truth has its way of coming out…
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_10=I don't blame her. I deserve it!
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_11=Han Ling…she is too kind. I'm so ashamed.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_12=I took this sword, hoping to avenge my wife, but I never went through with it. Let it now be wielded by one with the courage that I lacked, to shed light on the whole truth.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_13=What's the matter?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_14=What is the meaning of this?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_15=What the...I thought you can discover the truth. I didn't expect you to make up such a ridiculous story.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_16=You moron!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_01=Why? Is there some misunderstanding?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_02=Wait, did you just say a ghost? What else did she say about that?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_03=So when Han Xue admitted that she was the ghost, you believed her because she is your family.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_04=If your daughter wanted to kill you, she would have done something easier, like poison. Why pretending to be a ghost? If you are willing to trust me, give me some time and I'll find the truth.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_05=I'll go talk to her now. Farewell.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_06=Mr. Han, I have the answer you seek. But first, I'd like to offer you a deal.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_07=Brilliant Sword.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_08=It was eight years ago. After witnessing your wife's violent death, you took your daughters to the Northern Plains, but you didn't expect that a lone survivor from Ice Spirit Castle would find you here. She told Han Xue that you hid the truth of your wife's death from her. Han Xue agreed to find the Brilliant Sword for this lone survivor, in order to avenge her mother. She then masqueraded as her mother's ghost.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_09=But what you don’t know is you have a habit of talking in your sleep. Han Xue overheard what you said and disguised herself as a ghost. She cannot accept the fact that her father gave up her mother just to stay alive.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_10=Actually her intent was not to kill you. Han Ling also hopes the three of you can live together.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_11=Then give the Brilliant Sword to me. I will bring it to its rightful owner.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_12=Only the victor has the right to the truth.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_13=Have you really done that to your daughter?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_14=Making her your…sex slave!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_15=What's more, this whole story about a ghost, it was you who made it all up to cover your crimes.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_16=I think I should kill you right now!
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_01=What do you mean by that? Should my sister be responsible for our mistakes?
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_02=I do.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_03=I don't know whether to believe it or not.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_04=They used to be very close. Father always said I am not as smart as my sister.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_05=What's this?
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_06=He finds me a disappointment. Perhaps because I lack any martial art talent.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_07=She treats me very well…in diet and daily life.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_08=I don't know. She never speaks to me about things like that. She treats me as a little girl who knows nothing. I do know that Ding Mang likes her though.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_09=He is a self-righteous lecher. It is strange that he identified my sister as the murderer.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_10=Yes. I was the only one who was sleeping when it happened. I didn't know anything happened until the day after.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_11=I don't know but he always practices outside of Phantom's Mountain Manor. I heard that you have promised to my father that you will solve the case in three days.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_12=What have you found?
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_13=My father is talking to her now. What have you found?
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_14=Ok.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_15=My sister and I.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_16=That was me. My sister gave me some water to drink before I went to bed. Is there anything wrong?
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_17=My sister sedated me?
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_18=Who could it be? If it is my sister…then why would she do this to me!?
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_19=A ghost...yes! People have said they saw a ghost several times though I only saw it once.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_20=Hmm…yes. October 8th.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_21=It was my birthday. My sister gave me a sachet as a gift. My father was a little upset, probably because he was reminded of my mother.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_22=Ding Mang was out looking for girls. Is there anything else?
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_23=I've never seen these shoes...I can tell you that they must have been worn by a girl as they smell of rouge which is different from my sister's.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_24=They are from Fuxiang Room in the capital. That type of rouge there is very expensive. I know it because my mother used to have some.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_25=She's with my father. I'll get her for you.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_26=Have you considered me before you did this? Do I really want the truth at the cost of my family? I don't care about my late mother. I was too young to remember her. You and your father are who I care about.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_27=Let me talk to Mr. Han. I will ask him to give me the Yao Blade so I can use it to find Tian Xi. We will find the people who killed your mother.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_28=Why do you mean by that? I know everything about Phantom's Mountain Manor.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_29=Of course, including the ghost.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_30=I didn't lie. I remember that day because it was my birthday. My sister gave me a sachet as birthday gift. (Place the sachet in your backpack as "evidence 1")
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_31=No, it appeared several times after that but I only saw it once. Why should I tell you more? I saw you speaking with Ding Mang for a long time. You are probably no better than him.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_32=I know Phantom's Mountain Manor has a bad reputation but my family would never kill the innocent.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_33=I have spoken with my sister and she said she did everything herself.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_34=No... My sister had a good relationship with my father. There must be a reason for her actions.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_35=Ok, I will.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_36=Ok.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_37=There's only one and it looked like a female. It appeared at midnight. My father was drunk at that time...My sister and I saw it while we were washing dishes. My sister chased after it as but she said it disappeared into the forest.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_38=My father has always been very good to her. The day after my sister started to avoid my father and no longer helped take care of him.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_39=Yes. I heard about the other times from my father. I'm a light sleeper so it was strange that I slept through those times. You'll have to ask others about what happened.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_40=What are you doing here?
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_41=What have you found?
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_42=I drink a cup of tea before I sleep every night…My sister gives it to me each night...why would she sedate me?
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_43=No. These are not my father's. They have smell of rouge which is from the Fuxiang Room in the capital. My mother used to use it but my sister and I haven't used any for a long time.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_44=She asked us to tie her up. Hold on. I'll go find her.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_45=Have you considered me when you did this? Do I want the truth at the cost of losing my family? I don't care about the late mother. I was too young to remember her. But I care about you and father. I hope both of you are fine and we live happily together.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_45_1=Hang Ling, I'm so sorry…
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_45_2=So, at least you are on my side.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_45_2=You are welcome.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_01=Are you Han Xue's sister?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_02=Do you believe that your sister disguised herself as a ghost and tried to kill your father?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_03=How is the relationship between your sister and father?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_04_1=Option One: (Did Han Ling do it out of jealousy?) Ask Han Ling
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_04_2=Option Two: (Maybe I can get clues from Han Xue) Ask Han Xue
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_05=How does your father treat you?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_06=What about your sister?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_07=(Diet and daily life? Strange...) Is there anyone that your sister likes?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_08=Ding Mang? Can you tell me about him?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_09=(This is important. I have to find Ding Mang.) Was Ding Mang there when it happened?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_10=Where is Ding Mang now?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_11=(Wish me luck.) Yes. That being the case I must hurry and find Ding Mang. Goodbye.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_12=(What Ding Mang told me is ridiculous. Should I tell her?) I've found some clues…where is Han Xue?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_13=Before anything I need you to answer some questions.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_14=Who stays in the room?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_15=The teacup has been used. Was it by you or your sister?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_16=The reason why you were in such a deep sleep is because there was a sedative placed in your water.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_17=Possibly. It may not have been her.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_18=Calm yourself. Jumping to conclusions will not help. Have you noticed anything odd about your sister recently? Or…a ghost…have you seen one?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_19=Do you remember what day you saw it?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_20=(Three days after Old Lady Qin was murdered and also the day when Tian Xi arrived in the Northern Plains.) Is there anything significant about that day?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_21=Was it only your father and sister celebrating your birthday with you? What about Ding Mang?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_22=I found a pair of men's shoes.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_23=Worn by a girl? (Are they Tian Xi's? Why would she wear a pair of men's shoes?) Can you tell me anything else?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_24=Thank you. Where is your sister?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_25=Thank you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_26=(Choking) Sorry...
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_27=Thank you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_28=What do you know?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_29=(Ghost? Ding Mang didn't say anything about a ghost. Does he not know about it? I must see if Han Ling can provide some clues.) Ok. I'm going to ask you some questions to see if you've been truthful. When did the ghost appear?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_30=It appeared only once?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_31=A good person? It's funny to hear people from Phantom's Mountain Manor talking about good or bad people.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_32=Killing is not the sole criteria when judging whether a person is good or not. For example, your sister tried to killed your father yet you defend her. Why are you so obsessive? Don't you want to find out the real reason why your sister tried to kill your father?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_33=Can you be sure of that?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_34=If you want to find the truth then you need to cooperate with me.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_35=I have some questions.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_36=A ghost appearing on your birthday. How many ghosts and were they male or female?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_37=What's the relationship between your sister and father?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_38=You mentioned that the ghost appeared several times but you only saw it once.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_39=(I've got some new clues. I'll try speaking with Han Xue again) Thank you. I'm going to speak with Han Xue now.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_40=I've got some clues and I am going to ask your sister.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_41=You slept so deep during those days because this the teacup contained a sedative.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_42=Because she didn't want you to know what she did. Do you recognize these shoes?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_43=(Rouge from the Fuxiang Room is exclusive to rich families. Do they belong to Tian Xi? I'd better ask Han Xue.) By the way, who tied up your sister?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_44=Ok. Take your time.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_45=Let me talk to Mr. Han. I will ask him to give me Yao Blade and find Tian Xi with it. We will find the mysterious people who killed your mother.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_001_45_1=(Han Ruogu won't believe me so easily. I'd better find Ding Mang first.)
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_01=Were you looking for me?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_02=I'm not interested in conspiracy theories. The so-called ghost was Han Xue and she wanted to kill Han Ruogu. It's that simple.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_03=Oh, so you're a clever one. Fine, I suppose you'll figure this out sooner or later: Han Ruogu was molesting his own daughter. It finally occurred to Han Xue that what he was doing to her was wrong.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_04=If you don't believe me, go talk to them yourself. Hear what they have to say.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_05=You are keen on solving mysteries, aren't you? Well, let's see what you have.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_06=One good turn deserves another. If I'm interested in what you have to say, then perhaps I can be of some use to you.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_07=Tian Xi? Is she beautiful?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_08=Then let me take one good look at her. I won't let a beautiful woman slip away from my sight like that!
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_09=Excellent! Then we have an agreement.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_10=I came to the Northern Plains because of Han Xue.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_11=I'm not sure, and maybe that's just as well. Yesterday, she stabbed her own father. Good thing she didn't kill him.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_12=They got along fine until a few days ago. I saw her staring at her father's house with hatred in her eyes. She told me that Han Ruogu did a disgraceful thing.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_13=She mumbled a bit, but I understood her. Her father was keeping her as a concubine.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_14=I don't know. Did Han Xue lie to me?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_15=Have you got the answer?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_16=So be it. What do you want?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_17=And what do I get in return?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_18=That's not enough. I'll take that secret letter from Lord Qin as well.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_19=Very well. I'll go get that sword of yours now.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_20=I've got the Brilliant Sword. You can tell me the truth now.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_21=That's it?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_22=I thought she would get close to me if she hated her father. Ah well, let's just forget this whole thing. At least this Lord Qin's bounty will keep me busy for a while.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_01=I need to know what happened in Phantom's Mountain Manor.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_02=As far as I know, Han Xue has a good relationship with her father.  So why did she want to kill him?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_03=That's outrageous!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_04_1=I'll go talk to Han Xue.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_04_2=I'll speak with Han Ruogu.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_05=Why should I help you?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_06=To be honest, I was sent by Lord Qin to catch Tian Xi. If you could help...
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_07=Why, of course. She is the third lady of the Changfeng Agency, after all.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_08=I'm sure she will exceed all your expectations.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_09=Apparently. Let me see what I can do for you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_10=You like her?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_11=You don't say. So she hasn't gotten along well with her father.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_12=Disgraceful thing?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_13=That's outrageous! If what you say is true, then how could Han Ruogu live alone in one house, while his own wife and daughter live together in another home?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_14=It is hard to say. Let me go talk to her in person.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_15=Yes. But first, I want you to honor our agreement.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_16=A blade inscribed with the character "Yao", which means "brilliant." It is in Han Ruogu's room.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_17=The truth.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_18=But…fine, it's a deal.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_19=I will wait for you here.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_20=Han Xue said those things to you because she didn't want you to pay attention to her. She avoided you because she knew how Han Ruogu just stood by while watching his wife die.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_21=That's it.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_001_22=The Brilliant Sword, then, for Lord Qin's letter. Now that we're done here, I will take your leave.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_003_40_1=Submit Teacup (Submitting wrong item will result in at most 20% HP reduction)

Npc_newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_02=Your kung fu is not bad. But you've already been poisoned with Half Moon, he he he…
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_03=That's why they call me the Blackpool Devil. If you want to live, work for me. Find Young Herbalist and get an antidote from him. Don't even try to steal it…if you don't know the precise prescription, it will just kill you instead!
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_01=Who are you? You look like you've been poisoned with Half Moon.
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_02=Well, so we have another one. Get me Viper Venom, Potent Scorpion Venom and Lightning Mink Venom first, then we'll make you an antidote.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_01=Why are you doing this? We've just met, and I mean you no harm!
Player_newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_02=You ruthless monster!
Player_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_01=Oh good, so you can tell. Are you the Young Herbalist? Blackpool Devil asked me to get an antidote.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_02=Right away!
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_03=Well? Did you get all the venoms I need?
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_04=All right, give me a moment…there, it's finished. Take the antidote to the Blackpool Devil.
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_01=Are you the one who was poisoned by Blackpool Devil? Go and check the corpse over there, then return to Blackpool Devil.
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_04=Do you have the antidote?
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_05=Yes, I'll take that Brilliant Sword from you. In return, I'll give you some Half Moon, and more than enough Hundred Beads to neutralize the poison! I think you got yourself the better end of the deal!
Player_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_03=Yes, it wasn't easy.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_04=Thank you!
Player_newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_03=Here, take this! Now cure me!
Player_newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_04=Such bad luck, for running into you. The Brilliant Sword is yours.
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_01m=Why are you here in the first place? Do you have a death wish?
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_02m=It is you who should show me respect! Around here, they call me the Little Devil. I'm famous!
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_03m=Indeed. You are poisoned with my Half Moon. You will die if you don't have antidote in two hours.
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_04m=Are you going to talk to me like that, while you're completely at my mercy? I need some medicinal herbs now. Collect them for me and I will consider whether to give you the antidote.
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_yt_01=Yes, I see her. Are you poisoned by Half Moon?
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_yt_02=Don't say anything. The poison is going to be effective. Drink the medicinal herbs.
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_yt_03=How do you feel?
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_mt_01=You are not dead? Have you got the medicinal herbs?
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_mt_02=Give it to me. What takes you so long time?
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_mt_03=What? That must be Young Herbalist. I need some more time to make the antidote. You kill Young Herbalist first.
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_yt_04=We meet again.
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_yt_05=Little Devil likes to threaten people like that. I have the antidote here. Take it.
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_yt_06=The Hundred Beads is for you. You will be more safe in the bog with it. I have an antidote for Blackpool Devil. Can you deliver it to him for me?
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_hmt_01=Who are you? How dare you interrupt me when I am practicing?
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_hmt_02=Why didn't he come? Forget it. Give it to me. You have Yao Blade? I like it. Give it to me.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_01m=Have more respect for your elders, child! I am here to track down Tian Xi, who is wanted for murder.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_02m=But I've never heard of you…ah, never mind. I have more urgent matters at hand.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_03m=But I've never met you! Why did you do this to me? Give me the antidote!
Player_newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_04m=Fine, you leave me with no choice.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_sj_yt_01=How do you know it? You are also a kid...What's your relationship with Little Devil?
Player_newworld_beiyuan_sj_yt_02=Really? I will take it.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_sj_yt_03=Are you with Little Devil? I don't believe you.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_sj_yt_04=Much better. Thank you. I must get going.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_sj_mt_01=I met a kid who called himself Young Herbalist on the road.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_sj_mt_02=Well...OK. I hope you keep your promise.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_sj_yt_05=Are you Young Herbalist? Little Devil asked me to kill you before he gives me the antidote.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_sj_yt_06=Thank you.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_sj_yt_07=Sure.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_sj_hmt_01=You are Blackpool Devil? I am here to give you Young Herbalist's antidote.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_sj_hmt_02=He doesn't look like a good person. I will give the blade to him and do something to the antidote.
Player_newworld_beiyuan_sj_hmt_03=I should keep my promise and give him the antidote. But Yao Blade is very important to me. I cannot give it to others.
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_mt_01a=You didn't kill Young Herbalist? Don't you want to live? Watch this.
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_hmt_01a=The antidote is not real. Alas!
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_mt_01b=He cheated me and knew the antidote of Half Moon. He cannot live. Kill!
Npc_newworld_beiyuan_sj_mt_01c=Nice Kung Fu. I won't be willing to let it go.

menu_newworld_beiyuan_yd_007_2_1=Due to the Lord Qin Residence murder case the Northern Plains will be filled with unrest. You'd better be careful.
title_newworld_beiyuan_yd_007_2_1=Thank you for your concern.
newworld_beiyuan_yd_007_2_1_1=You are welcome.
title_newworld_beiyuan_yd_004_001=Why do you claim Xian Xi is the murderer? You don't know what you're talking about. Watch!
title_beiyuan_yd_001=We came a long way to get to the Northern Plains. We must seize the opportunity.
title_beiyuan_yd_002=If we can uncover the truth, we will be known for generations.
title_beiyuan_yd_003=He is right. The Ancient Manual Script is sought after every faction. It is unexpected that both Lord Qin's Residence and the Changfeng Escort Agency have taken the script as reward.
title_beiyuan_yd_004=Tian Xi was audacious to have murdered Old Lady Qin. Now Lord Qin is furious and even His Majesty is aware of it.
title_beiyuan_yd_005=Lord Qin has identified Tian Xi as the murderer and issued an order to apprehend her. The Changfeng Escort Agency has offered a reward to apprehend not Tiaxn Xi but whomever is the real murder. This is unusual.
title_beiyuan_yd_006=In this case, we will play it by ear. It will be the best that we can catch Tian Xi and deliver her to Lord Qin. We should also still take time to look into things further to determine if someone else is the murderer.
title_beiyuan_yd_007=We have to consider things carefully before coming to a decision. First of all, it's not easy to find a girl in the vastness of the Northern Plains. Secondly, there are a lot of people other people arriving here due to this case. The three of us will have to formulate a plan.
title_beiyuan_yd_008=I am also worried. It is no longer just an altercation between Lord Qin's Residence and the Changfeng Escort Agency. The East Chamber, Phantom's Mountain Manor, Blackpool Devil, White Mountain Sect, Killers' Manor and Ancient Tomb Sect have all become involved. We must be careful.
title_beiyuan_yd_009=The reminder is necessary or things could become disastrous.
title_beiyuan_yd_01=You came to the Northern Plains alone and unprepared? And you're here for the reward?
title_beiyuan_yd_02=It's true. Old Lady Qin was found dead in a locked-room on her 60th birthday. Later someone Tian Xi appeared outside of Old Lady Qin's room with bloodstains on her clothes and Old Lady Qin's hairpin in her hand. Lord Qin has determined Tian Xi the murderer due to this.
title_beiyuan_yd_03=The Northern Plains is a harsh and cold land. Look at you. You'll be dead within a day. Take this medicine. It will help you resist the cold.
title_beiyuan_yd_04=You owe me nothing. Just remember that I helped you.
title_beiyuan_yd_05=Ok. Do you have anymore questions?
title_beiyuan_yd_06=You are empathetic toward Tian Xi. According to sources, Tian Xi has escaped to the Northern Plains. If you find her, will you be able to apprehend her?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_015_001=Everything you say is true, I'm truly impressed. Would you be willing to do me a favor? Please bring this sachet of incense to my friend.

menue_beiyuan_yd_01=Please forgive me. I heard Tian Xi murdered Old Lady Qin. Is it true?
menue_beiyuan_yd_02=I heard of Tian Xi before. She is kindhearted though being proud. I cannot believe Tian Xi is the murderer.

menue_beiyuan_yd_04=Of course.
menue_beiyuan_yd_05=(Coughing) I heard that Tian Xi is now in the Northern Plains. Is it true?
menue_beiyuan_yd_06=Of course. The evidence is irrefutable. I have to catch her and send her to the authorities.
menue_beiyuan_yd_07=Tian Xi is kindhearted. There must be something we don't know. I will find out the truth. If Tian Xi is framed, I will prove her innocent. But if not, I...
menue_newworld_beiyuan_a2_015_001=Of course. You can count on me.
menue_newworld_beiyuan_yd_007_1=(It seems he knows the mysterious woman. I cannot disclose what happened just now.) I picked this sachet on the road.

menu_newworld_beiyuan_a3_006_1_1a=Wait.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a3_006_1_1a=You've flattered me.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a3_006_2_1a=I'm working for Lord Qin. It seems that the Divine Water Palace can handle these matters on their own.

newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_2_4_1=Very well. Sorry to have bothered you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_2_5=Do you know of the Demon's Gang?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_2_5=They say, when a Ghost Mask shows up, someone is surely going to die.
newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_2_5_1=You don't say.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_002_2_6=I never expected Old Man Lucky to be involved.

menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_003_2_7=So, you are the famous Plague Lady, I presume?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_003_2_7=I think the word you are looking for is notorious.

menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_2_5=Are you practicing martial arts?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_2_5=Go away!
newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_2_5_1=So what they say is true…the people of Northern Plains are indeed very rude.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_2_6=Are you looking for this?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_2_6=Twin Fish Jade Pendant. The very thing. I once said that I would become a sworn ally to anyone who will bring me this item.
newworld_beiyuan_a1_004_2_6_1=Such an unexpected honor.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_2_6=You're a brave little one to be alone here.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_2_6=Don't call me that.
newworld_beiyuan_a1_005_2_6_1=All right, I'll be nice.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_2_5=You're really too young to be here alone in such a desolate place.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_2_5=You're the one to talk. I know this place better than anyone.
newworld_beiyuan_a1_006_2_5_1=You have a point there.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_5=It's nice to see you, Mr. Han. I need to ask you about something.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_5=I assume you mean Half Moon, right? You'd better be careful with that.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_5_1=Thank you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_6=Nice to see you. I may have a favor to ask.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_6=The Myriad Weave Red Net is more trouble than it's worth. When it disappeared eight years ago, it should have stayed that way.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_6_1=Thank you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_7=Nice to see you. I may have a favor to ask.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_7=The place described in this map does not appear to be the Northern Plains at all. How could the East Chamber be duped like this? You're better off getting that information from the imperial court instead.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_7_1=Thanks for your advice.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_8=Phantom Mountain's Manor has made a name for itself here in the Northern Plains. Most impressive.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_8=Indeed, this place is good for us.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_002_2_8_1=Oh.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_023_2_4=I never heard of you in Phantom's Mountain Manor. Where are you from?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_023_2_4=Now I'm Phantoms' Mountain Manor.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_023_2_4_1=Yes.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_2=Do you know who once owned this sword?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_2=Let me take a look. This looks like one of the Brilliant Twin Swords. I can't remember whom it belongs to now.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_2_1=Thank you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_3=I heard people of the East Chamber have seen all kinds of treasures. Can you recognize this?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_3=Why, do you want me to take a look at it…what is this thing doing here in the Northern Plains? Wasn't it supposed to be destroyed? Is this a fake? Just take this thing and go!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_3_1=Oh, if you say so.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_4=I heard people in East Chamber have a great insight.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_4=Where did you get that Golden Skull? Give it to me!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_4_1=No way! I won't be bullied by the likes of you!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_5=Why are you here alone?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_5=That's none of your business.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_5_1=Fine, suit yourself.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_6=Are you also interested in the Northern Plains?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_6=I think you already know the answer to that.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_004_2_6_1=Very well.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_4=Speaking of women, do you know anything about this hairpin?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_4=It's just an ordinary hairpin. Any servant would wear it.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_4_1=Ordinary? I see. Thank you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_5=Speaking of woman. Do you know anything about this woman's hair pin?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_5=Why should I help you examine your things?
newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_5_1=Don't be so mean.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_6=Pervert, is that what they call you? Just how many girls have you violated?
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_6=What the hell are you talking about? None, none whatsoever!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_005_2_6_1=Take it easy. I'm just asking.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_3=I wish your grandpa were here. He would be able to tell me something about these items I have with me.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_3=So can I. What you have there is a parasitic poison, created by a powerful faction in the Southern Territories.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_3_1=Oh, so that's what it is.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_4=I wish your grandpa were here. He must recognize this.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_4=You think I'm just making it up because I don't know anything? Fine, I'm not going to tell you anymore.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_4_1=Cannot you see it?
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_5=Don't be upset. Here, have some fun with this mask.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_5=Are you trying to kill me? That's a Ghost Mask. Whoever wears it, dies!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_5_1=What? No!
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_6=Here, you can play with this mask.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_6=You are a bad person. I don't want anything from you.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_6_1=Don't be such a baby. You know I didn’t mean to scare you.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_7=I see that the Northern Plains is so full of wonders and riches, even a child would be drawn here.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_7=None of your business!
newworld_beiyuan_a2_006_2_7_1=You are a mean little one.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_019_1_1=I'd like to meet the lady.
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_019_1_1=Our lady is not meeting with anybody today.
newworld_beiyuan_jy_019_1_1_1=Well.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_020_1_1=I was wondering if I could meet with the lady.

menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_017_2_2=Have you seen this hair pin before?
title_newworld_beiyuan_jy_017_2_2=No, I haven't.

menu_newworld_beiyuan_jy_017_2_3=Have you seen this hair pin?

menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_016_2_2=Your being alive is what matters now.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_016_2_2=You are right. Where did you get the Arrow of Gratitude? Its owner…his woman…they are no longer with us.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_016_2_2_1=And so it is.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_016_2_3=I'm sorry for your loss.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_016_2_3=Thanks. The Lady Portrait that you have looks familiar. Is that why you are here?
newworld_beiyuan_a2_016_2_3_1=You are in grief. We can talk about that later.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_016_2_4=Let the dead keep their stories. It's important that we stay alive.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_016_2_4=Thank you. Why are you clinging to Essence of Caducity? I don't expect you to use it.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_016_2_4_1=It's just another piece of evidence.
menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_016_2_5=Everyone dies eventually. We can remember those we love, and still let them go. You must recover your health and go on living.
title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_016_2_5=Yes, you take care, too. Remember, many people are coveting the Myriad Weave Red Net.
newworld_beiyuan_a2_016_2_5_1=Thanks for reminding me.

title_newworld_beiyuan_a2_017_2_3=No, don't bother me.

menu_newworld_beiyuan_a2_017_2_4=Are you familiar with this jade pendant?

xiakedao_jianshudashi_9=It's been nice training with you…may we meet again!
xiakedao_jianshudashi_10=I'm off!
xiakedao_jianshudashi_11=Styles of swordsmanship are always changing, and they've become too many to mention. However, back in China, the many styles still fall under several major types. The Taichi Sword of Wudang, for example, is the ultimate expression of the so-called "pliable" type, whilst the Emei practises a more "technical" discipline. Other types include the "drunken" and the "traveling" styles.
xiakedao_jianshudashi_12=Interesting. Thank you for your explanation.
xiakedao_jianshudashi_13=Again, there are many, but it's not just a repetition of various sword movements, but how you use the sword on a daily basis. There are those whose weapons would never draw blood, whilst others improve only in the heat of real battle, where lives are at stake.
xiakedao_jianshudashi_14=Thank you!
xiakedao_jianshudashi_15=Do not let the sword be just another weapon. It is an extension of yourself, so that having it in your hand ought to come as naturally as you breathe and walk.
xiakedao_jianshudashi_16=Thank you!
xiakedao_jianshudashi_17=Thank you for your words of wisdom, master. May we have a sparring match, so that I may put those words into action?
xiakedao_jianshudashi_18=Of course. I'll use a fraction of my true strength, until you're ready for more.
xiakedao_jianshudashi_19=Thank you. Let's begin!
xiakedao_jianshudashi_18_1=We've done enough sparring for today. Get some rest, and come back later!
xiakedao_jianshudashi_19_1=But…all right.
newworld_xkdnpc_012_attack_text1=Let's begin. En garde!
newworld_xkdnpc_012_attack_text2=You're taking too much time. Are you learning anything?
newworld_xkdnpc_012_attack_text3=Not bad! I see you have a knack for learning this skill!
newworld_xkdnpc_013=Tian Boan (expert bladesman)
newworld_xkdnpc_013_attack=Tian Boan (Tyrant blade)
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_01=The blade is the mainstay of melee weapons. A bladesman must not only be strong, but fearless!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_02=Are you the expert bladesman I've been hearing about?
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_03=I've been wielding a blade since I was six years old. At age ten, they called me a master. Tell you what, since you caught me in a good mood today, I'll teach you a thing or two, but only if can answer my questions correctly!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_04=I'd be honored! Please, ask me anything.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_q1=How is the blade typically described by poets?
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a1r=The soul of the infantry.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a1w=The noblest of sidearms.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_q2=How should a blademan behave in battle?
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a2r=One must advance or hold ground, but never yield.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a2w=One must nimbly dodge and weave to move with the flow of battle.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_q3=How does one cleave?
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a3r=A cleave is an offensive move, intending to slay the target with a final, decisive strike.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a3w=Thrust towards your target, then execute the cleave as a finishing move.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_q4=How does one sweep?
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a4r=<s>
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a4w=Taunt your target with a wide sweep, intimidating him into thinking you are about to strike him down.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_q5=What is a pick?
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a5r=A sweep catches the target off balance, but must be executed only when the target's defense is lowered.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a5w=To pick is to make a quick cut in very close quarters, when you breach your target's defenses.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_q6=How does one stab?
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a6r=A pick is a fast, reactive move, a quick slash linking your next chain of attack.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a6w=<s>
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_q7=How does one chop?
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a7r=Like a cleave, a chop is a powerful, decisive attack, unleashed when your victory is certain.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a7w=A blade is not designed to stab. However, it does have a sharp end, which is best utilized after a long chop, when your target least expects it.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_q8=How does one taunt?
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a8r=<s>
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a8w=<s>
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_q9=how does one thrust?
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a9r=<s>
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a9w=<s>
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_q10=How does one make a quick cut?
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a10r=<s>
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_05_a10w=<s>
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_06=Good answer. That's exactly what I'd say.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_07=I need to take care of something right now. Come see me later!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_08=Farewell!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_09=That's right. Exactly what I think as well.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_10=Next question, please.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_11=No, that's incorrect!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_12=It appears you're not the kind of bladesman I had in mind.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_13=You better take care, then. It's a dangerous world out there.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_14=So long!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_15=I'm not in the mood to teach you right now. Come back later!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_16=May we meet again soon!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_17=Ha ha, that's right! All right, let's have a friendly match, I'll give you some pointers as we trade our blows.
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_18=Thank you! I'm ready!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_19=You look exhausted. Go get some rest, and we'll spar some other time!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_20=Thank you!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_21=I'm ready when you are. Let's see what I can learn from you!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_22_0=On your guard, then!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_22_1=Swing harder! Have you had anything to eat?
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_22_2=Keep going! Don't stop!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_22_3=Don't just stand there and look at me! Cut me down with all your strength!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_22_4=All these years of training you've had, and you're still as soft as a beginner!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_23=No, no, you need more training on your own! I'm leaving!
newworld_xkdnpc_013_talk_24=Not bad, not bad! I need to take care of something right now. We'll do this again soon!
newworld_xkdnpc_016=Gu Jue (stranded monk)
newworld_xkdnpc_017=Gu Wu (stranded nun)
newworld_xkdnpc_018=Chang Fa (stranded peasant)

newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_02=Help! Will anyone help me?
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_03=Help, someone, help! I'm so hungry and thirsty!
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_04=I'm dying! Is there anyone who can help me?
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_05=I've been pious all my life…what have I done to deserve this?
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_06=Somebody, give me some water…I'm so thirsty!
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_07=I need something to eat…I've not eaten for many days!
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_08=I'm so thirsty…drinking seawater just makes me even thirstier…
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_09=I wish I had never got on that damn boat! Now I'm going to die on this god-forsaken island…
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_10=I have a family waiting for me back home…please help!
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_11=Please help! I'll do anything to repay your kindness!
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_12=What happened to you?
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_12title=What does it look like? We're shipwrecked, and stranded here for days without any food or water! We're dying here!
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_12text=I'll see if I can find some food and drinking water for you.
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_13=I'll get you some drinking water. What would you like to eat?
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_13title=If you can bring me some cooked meat and a bowl of drinking water, or ten fruits, I'd be back on my feet in no time!
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_13text=I'll see what I can do.
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_14=Here are some cooked meat and drinking water. Take them!
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_14_1=Here are some fruits for you. Eat up!
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_15=I don't have any food, either…
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_16=Since you're going to die, anyway, why don't I just end your misery now and take your things?
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_17=Thank you, hero! You've saved my life!
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_18=I lost everything in the shipwreck. I don't have anything to give you.
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_19=I don't have anything to give you as thanks right now…I will reward you properly when I can!
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_20=Thank you for your help. You saved my life!
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_21=The shipwreck took away everything I have, except these stones I have with me.
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_22=Please, take this, it's all I have.
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_23=We hear this is a bountiful island, full of live game and edible fruits. If I only have the strength to find them myself…
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_24=Just hang in there. I'll get them for you.
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_25=Have mercy! Don't kill me!
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_26=I really have nothing to give you! Please, spare me…

newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_28=Please don't kill me…
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_29=The shipwreck took away everything I have, except these stones I have with me.
newworld_xkdnpc_016_talk_30=Here, take them! Just don't kill me!
newworld_xkdnpc_021=mottled stone wall
newworld_xkdnpc_022=Mottled Stone Wall
talk_newworld_xkdnpc_022=(The carvings on this mottled stone wall depict some words, and a person practicing kung fu…)
task_newworld_xkdnpc_022=There are some texts and figures practicing martial arts on the stone wall.
newworld_xkdnpc_022_talk_01=Let's take a closer look.
newworld_xkdnpc_021_talk_01=Ow, my head…everything is still blurry…
newworld_xkdnpc_021_talk_02=What is this place? What am I doing here?
newworld_xkdnpc_021_talk_03=You hear a voice inside your head: "You are reliving someone's memory. Go to the old man."
newworld_xkdnpc_021_talk_03_1=All right…
newworld_xkdnpc_021_talk_04=This old man looks very skilled. I'd like to spar with him.
newworld_xkdnpc_021_talk_05=Voice inside your head: "Prove your worth to the elder in three tests."
newworld_xkdnpc_021_talk_06=Very well. Let's do this…but how?

newworld_xkdnpc_030_talk_01=Hmm, this dancing move does not really follow the Taichi Sword technique…
newworld_xkdnpc_030_talk_02=This winged stance can be very strong, but takes a long time to build up its power…
newworld_xkdnpc_030_talk_03=I like the speed of this move! Excellent!
newworld_xkdnpc_030_talk_04=Solar eclipse!
newworld_xkdnpc_030_talk_05=This move is powerful, but it also uses up much internal strength.
newworld_xkdnpc_030_talk_06=Sinking earth! I stand alone!
newworld_xkdnpc_030_talk_07=Falling stars!
newworld_xkdnpc_030_talk_08=Howling river!
newworld_xkdnpc_030_talk_09=This is a balanced move, readily adjustable for both offense and defense.
newworld_xkdnpc_030_talk_10=This move is powerful, but it takes too long to get ready for it.
newworld_xkdnpc_030_talk_11=This is a solid defense…
newworld_xkdnpc_030_player_01=Whoa…where am I now? Why is everthing so blurry?
newworld_xkdnpc_030_player_02=I thought I was starting to make sense of the inscribed writings…maybe that's how I got here.
newworld_xkdnpc_030_player_03=There's somewhere there…what's he doing?
newworld_xkdnpc_030_player_04=Well, let's ask him and find out.
newworld_xkdnpc_030_boss_01=Sir…
newworld_xkdnpc_030_boss_02=…….
newworld_xkdnpc_030_boss_03=Sir…can you tell me what this place is?

newworld_xkdnpc_030_boss_07=Sir, I've thought of something…ow, I'm getting so dizzy…
newworld_xkdnpc_030_boss_08=(You are still talking. Wait a moment before selecting the next dialogue.)
newworld_xkdnpc_030_boss_09=(You are in a state of silent comprehension. Please wait.)
newworld_xkdnpc_030_boss_10=(You are feeling disoriented. The more you stare at the carvings, the dizzier you feel…perhaps it's best you come back later.)

newworld_xkdnpc_030_boss_24=I think I'm making some progress. Let's keep going.
newworld_xkdnpc_030_boss_25=Other than getting dizzier as I stare at the carvings, nothing else is happening. Maybe I should come back some other time.

newworld_xkdnpc_014_talk_02=Sure! What's the game?
newworld_xkdnpc_014_talk_03=It's a simple guessing game we play with our hands. Know it?
newworld_xkdnpc_014_talk_04=Show me. I'm a quick learner.
newworld_xkdnpc_014_talk_05=Now, all at the same time, we show a hand sign like rock, paper or scissors, while calling out the hand sign. If you are the first to call out the correct hand sign for both of us, you win! Also, to start each round, you put down 1 stone coin for me. If you win, I'll pay you back 10 stone coins! Interested?
newworld_xkdnpc_014_talk_06=What kind of nonsense is this? Fine, I'll play, if only to make you happy.

talk_newworld_xkdnpc_041_text_03=Hmm, the chi is in balance, but the meridians to the seven phases are still unlocked. How frustrating!
talk_newworld_xkdnpc_041_text_04=Seven phases…but nine acupoints? The fifth acupoint appears to be the locus…among the others, there must be one that is disrupting the flow of chi.
talk_newworld_xkdnpc_041_text_05=How do I find this disrupting acupoint? I need a true expert here on this island to spar with me, so that we can discover it together…
talk_newworld_xkdnpc_041_text_06=Come, young one! Help me solve this puzzle!
talk_newworld_xkdnpc_041_text_07=I…I'm not sure if I can help you…
talk_newworld_xkdnpc_041_text_07_1=Very well. Let me pull out the sword!
talk_newworld_xkdnpc_041_text_08=No, not like that! Listen carefully: There are nine swords on the ground, corresponding to the nine acupoints on the old sword itself. Each acupoint has a chi value, and you must pick three different swords so that their chi values add up to 15. This is what I've discovered: Acupoint Three has the value of 2, Acupoint Four is 3, Acupoint Six is 7, Acupoint Seven is 8, Acupoint Nine is 6. In the end, you must clear the meridian ending in the acupoint with the chi value of 4!

newworld_xkdnpc_051_talk_06=Of course. What would you like to have?
newworld_xkdnpc_052_talk_01=I make the finest wines on this island. If you want a taste, you'd better bring me something good, and then play a drinking game with me!
newworld_xkdnpc_052_talk_02=All right, tell me what I can get you.
newworld_xkdnpc_052_talk_03=I've spent all my money on wine, so bring me a stone coin!
newworld_xkdnpc_052_talk_04=I want someone to make me a nice meal. Bring me 5 pieces of raw meat!

newworld_xkdnpc_052_talk_09=Now, all at the same time, we show a hand sign like rock, paper or scissors, while calling out the hand sign. If you are the first to call out the correct hand sign for both of us, you win! If you lose, you have to drink a round. If you win, I'll pay you 10 stone coins! Got it?
newworld_xkdnpc_052_talk_10=I get to drink, or get paid? Sounds like a win-win to me! I'm in!

newworld_xkdnpc_054_talk_002=You got it all wrong! My master says, all life is sacred according to the Tao, the way of nature. Buddha has nothing to do with it!
newworld_xkdnpc_054_talk_003=You're the one who's wrong! The Tao is but another expression of goodness and mercy, which is what Buddha teaches!
newworld_xkdnpc_054_talk_004=The way of nature is the way to goodness! How can it be otherwise?
newworld_xkdnpc_054_talk_005=There is evil as well as good in nature. Are you saying the Tao is the way to evil as well?
newworld_xkdnpc_054_talk_006=No, no, that's not what I'm saying at all! Oh wait…is that right…does the way of nature encompass both good and evil?
newworld_xkdnpc_054_talk_007=Good and evil are mutually exclusive! You can't be good and evil at the same time!
newworld_xkdnpc_054_talk_008=No, no, we Taoists are good people! My master is a good person! My fellow Taoist brothers, they are all good people!

newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_003=Ha! The little Taoist is so young and simple-minded. He'll never beat me in a debate!
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_004=If you're so much wiser, you should be setting a good example for him, instead of picking on him.
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_005=Don't blame me if he's not as smart as I am!
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_006=You're too stuck-up for your own good! What were you two arguing about, anyway?
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_007=Hee hee, wouldn't you like to know? Why don't I give you a quiz?
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_008=Fine, I'm no monk, but go ahead.
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_009=Which of the following texts gives us the concept of "to see the world in a grain of sand"?
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_010=The Avatamsaka Sutra.
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_011=The Tao Te Ching.
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_012=The Sutra of Great Compassion.
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_013="Life is but a dream": Is this a Buddhist or Taoist concept?
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_014=Taoist.
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_015=Buddhist.
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_016=So you know something about Buddhism! All right, here is a question about Taoism: What is the meaning of the way to explain all things, and yet all things cannot be explained in the way?
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_017=It is a matter of perception.
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_018=It depends on a broader definition of "the way."
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_019=Correct! I'm impressed. Now, answer me this: Does the way of nature lead to good, or to evil?
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_020=Both. Good and evil are relative to each other. To perceive one is to perceive the other.
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_021=Right again! Damn you!
newworld_xkdnpc_055_talk_022=When you've been around for as long as I have, you pick up a few things. Be nice to your little friend, will you?
newworld_xkdnpc_056_talk_001=Wahhh…that mean little monk! He's always picking on me…

newworld_xkdnpc_056_talk_003=Wahhh…that little monk always beats me in a debate. He's always the smarter one!
newworld_xkdnpc_056_talk_004=He thinks he's so clever, eh? Let's go show him who knows better!
newworld_xkdnpc_056_talk_005=No, you go! He's so mean to me, that nasty little monk…
newworld_xkdnpc_056_talk_006=All right, stay here. I'll show him.
newworld_xkdnpc_056_talk_007=Waahhhh….
newworld_xkdnpc_056_talk_008=Don't cry. I've just out-debated that little monk.

newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_003=Focus on Buddha's teachings. Why do you have to make things more difficult for yourself?
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_004=If I do not see the real world, as Buddha himself once did, how will I ever put his teachings into practice?
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_005=Buddha's wisdom is deep and profound. To undestand it is to have focus and dedication.
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_006=And that I shall have, by dedicating myself to the welfare of all people, not just those secluded in a monastery!
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_007=The world at large is full of sin. It is a distraction.
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_008=To see the world in sin is to understand the value of virtue all the more.
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_009=We must follow what is best for us. You must reconsider!
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_013=You are already aware of the sinfulness of the world. Why become a part of it, when you already know your way to salvation?
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_014=I was born of the world. I must therefore become a part of the world.
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_015=We Buddhists strive to leave the mortal coil, to escape from the world of sin and suffering. What better way to do so, then to devote oneself to a life of secluded contemplation?
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_016=Buddha was once a worldly man, and he also taught of ways of mercy and kindness. To be kind to others in a world of sin, is to transcend sin itself!
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_017=How will you attain true salvation, if you are corrupted by the sins of the world?
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_018=We are sinners, one and all! But I will follow the path of Buddha, and go not astray!
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_019=If you are so mired in sin, how will you ever attain enlightment?
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_010=(Continue to follow the conversation with the monks.)
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_011=It's wrong.
newworld_xkdnpc_057_talk_012=(You've already heard enough from the monks for today. Come back later!)
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_001=Do not be tempted by worldly distractions! Yi Jing, you must return to the monastery with me!
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_002=Why do you want to take Master Jing away? Let me go ask him.
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_003=Jing Yi has gone into the laymen's world, against the wishes of our abbot. I intend to bring him back to our cloistered sanctuary, so that he can be reconciled with the dharma.
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_004=I understand that you can be a pious monk, whether or not you seclude yourself in a monastery, away from the world at large. Why do you insist on seclusion?
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_005=The outside world has too many distractions. How will you learn the true meaning of dharma in a such a short lifetime, amid all the chaos?
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_006=We all have our own respective destinies. Life is indeed as short as you say, so why shouldn't we all follow where our own hearts beckon?
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_007=With due respect, you are in no position to lecture me. Since you're not a monk, I don't expect you to understand.
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_008=I'm not a monk, but I have much respect for your faith, and strive to understand it the best I can.
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_009=That's absurd! If you presume to understand my faith, then answer this: Which text teaches you that you reap what you sow, even in the depth of your own heart?
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_010=From the Jade Treatise of Ethics. The idea is a variation of the Golden Rule, taught in the Christian Bible.
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_011=<s>
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_012=<s>
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_013=The trinity of Eastern faiths - Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism - are three facets of the same. Is this concept more akin with Buddhists, or Taoists?

newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_015=<s>
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_016=Impressive, so you are well learned. Let me ask you this, then: To save a life is to ascend seven levels of heaven. How is this concept symbolized?
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_017=By the seven spokes in the wheel of transmigration.
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_018=By the seven tiers of a Buddhist pagoda.
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_019=Correct! If you are so wise, then tell me, why must Yi Jing and I insist on our different views regarding the laity? Who is to say which one of us is right?
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_020=There is no right or wrong in this. What matters is your respect for one's true calling.
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_021=But…the abbot says Yi Jing is not ready to go out into the real world. I must bring him back.
newworld_xkdnpc_058_talk_022=Please don't be so stubborn, Master Xu.
newworld_xkdnpc_059_talk_001=Buddha is merciful to all. How will I understand the nature of sin and virtue, if I do not go live in the real world?
newworld_xkdnpc_059_talk_002=You have a kind heart, Master Jing. Why does Master Xu insist on taking you back to the monastery?
newworld_xkdnpc_059_talk_003=At the monastery, I study the sutras, where all things are distilled as abstractions. I long to live in the real world, where I put Buddha's teachings of kindness and mercy into practice!
newworld_xkdnpc_059_talk_004=That is very noble of you. Why does Master Xu not see it your way?
newworld_xkdnpc_059_talk_005=My calling is my own. Just as I will not force Brother Xu to come with me, I will not go back with him!
newworld_xkdnpc_059_talk_006=I see. Why don't I go have a talk with Master Xu, and see if he'll come around.
newworld_xkdnpc_059_talk_007=Do not try to convince me again. I'm not going back to the monastery!
newworld_xkdnpc_059_talk_008=As stubborn as he is, I'm sure Master Xu will eventually see things you way.
newworld_xkdnpc_059_talk_009=Amitaba! May you go with Buddha's blessings!

newworld_xkdnpc_060=Wang Er (old fishmonger)
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_001=Oh no! What's going to happen to my little girl?
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_002=What happened to her?
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_003=How many of those grouper fish do you need? Where exactly can I find them?
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_004=Here are 30 fish for you! Go make the antidote now!
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_005=My daughter was bitten by a snake…now she's so weak, she can't even get out of bed!
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_006=That's terrible! What can we do to save her?
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_007=A monk told me that the liver oil of the six-striped grouper fish can be made into an antidote. Those fish can only be found near an island in these parts…
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_008=That can be anywhere…I'll keep my eyes open for them!
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_009=The monk spotted those six-striped groups whilst aboard the Treasure of the Eastern Seas ferry, near the Island with No Name. We'll need at least 30 fish to make the antidote!
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_010=I'll head over there right now! I'll get your fish!
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_012=Are these the right kind of fish…oh please, great hero, you must help her!
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_013=(Give the old man 30 six-striped groupers.)
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_014=You don't have enough groupers!
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_015=Thank you, o great hero, thank you! My daughter is saved!

newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_020=Help, please….won't anyone help me?
newworld_xkdnpc_060_talk_021=Oh, my poor little girl!

newworld_xkdnpc_062_talk_002=What are some of your favorite wines?
newworld_xkdnpc_062_talk_003=I've travelled all over the empire, and sampled many fine quaffs. Among them, the multigrain brew of Sichuan Province is one of my favorites…it has a full body, robust flavor, and leaves a cool, pleasant aftertaste.
newworld_xkdnpc_062_talk_004=I wish I can have a taste of that!
newworld_xkdnpc_062_talk_005=Ha ha! I may not know about anything else, but I can talk forever about booze! I'd do anything for a fine cup of wine!

newworld_xkdnpc_062_talk_014=Oh, you're too kind…
newworld_xkdnpc_062_talk_015=Ha! Don't listen to a word that drunk is saying!
newworld_xkdnpc_062_talk_016=He's saying he's going to get some more wine, but he'll just end up too drunk even to stand on his own feet! I'll have to carry him home again, damn monk!
newworld_xkdnpc_062_talk_017=What Chenggang wine? You drank it all last month!
newworld_xkdnpc_062_talk_018=If you're going to be like that, I'm not going to share my meat with you!
newworld_xkdnpc_062_talk_019=Sorry, Brother Wu…I can't help it, I just get drunk every time I have a drink…
newworld_xkdnpc_062_talk_020=Next time you're like this, I'm going to throw you into the lake!
newworld_xkdnpc_062_talk_021=Don't…don't be like that…

newworld_xkdnpc_110_sys_001=You feel an errie presence at the stone wall, which is making you dizzing and faint…
newworld_xkdnpc_110_sys_002=Where am I…those two…aren't they Zhu Hai and Hou Ying, ancient heroes from the Spring and Autumn period in Li Bai's "A Warrior's Journey"?
newworld_xkdnpc_110_sys_003=Is this a dream? Ah, I may as well go greet them.
newworld_xkdnpc_110_sys_004=You're suddenly feeling both hot and cold. Execute a Taichi-based internal skill to balance your chi!
newworld_xkdnpc_110_sys_005=You're suddenly burning up. Execute an internal skill with Yin and soft attributes to reduce the heat!
newworld_xkdnpc_110_sys_006=You feel a chill overcoming your body. Execute an internal skill with hard and Yang attributes to mitigate the chill!
newworld_xkdnpc_110_sys_007=Congratulations, you have passed the second phase of the drinking test! Go talk to Hou Ying.
newworld_xkdnpc_110_sys_008=These writings are making you dizzy! Perhaps you should come back another day.

newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_002=Isn't it funny that we keep running into each other? Ha ha!
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_003=Have we met, elder?
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_004=Ha ha! See? I told you this one would be like this!
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_0041=Don't you remember us, kid?
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_005=I told you, every time the kid wakes up, he has totally forgotten who we are! You lost the bet, so drink up!
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_006=Why must you be so forgetful? Fine, bottoms up…
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_007=What's going on? What am I forgetting?
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_008=My young friend, you're here just in time. I have several jugs of fine wine here, which can be fortified by my own inner strength! We'll see how many of these you can chug down! Ha ha!
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_009=Keep an eye on these wines! Here we go!
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_010=All right, I'm going to start channeling my chi to fortify these wines. You must drink them in the exact order I tell you, or you risk being overcome by your own inner demons!

newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_025=You drank the wine in the wrong order…you start to feel dizzy.
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_026=You drank from 8 jugs of wine in the correct order!
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_028=You're doing well! You're halfway through the drinking test!
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_029=Are you starting to feel both hot and cold at the same time?
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_030=This is the second phase of the drinking test. Drink these three cups of wine, which will stir up the chi in your body. You must now learn to channel your chi in a timely manner!
newworld_xkdnpc_110_talk_031=Learn to channel your chi. If you feel you're burning, execute an internal skill with the Yin attribute to reduce the heat. If you're freezing, mitigate the chill by using an internal skill with the Yang attribute. If you're feeling hot and cold, execute a Taichi-style internal skill to balance your chi!

title_xiake_event_pizi_003=Some of us become bandits, so we can stand up to the vile, corrupt officials who get rich at the expense of us common folks, and offer us no protection against enemies from foreign shores! Care to join us, and be a hero amongst bandits?
title_xiake_event_pizi_004=It's easy! I have a task for you, to see if you have what it takes to be a bandit.

title_xiake_shp_jiuxian_001=(Singing off key) Have wine, will travel…la la la…
title_xiake_shp_jiuxian_002=A fine wine must be served in a fine cup to enhance the experience!
title_xiake_shp_jiuxian_003=<font color="#FF0000">I have with me 9 different kinds of fine wine, but with no cups to serve them. I hear the fisherman has a large cup, a rhino horn cup and an antique porcelain cup. The Joy Seekers gambling house should have a jade cup, a luminous cup, and an emerald cup. A Japanese ninja is said to have an antique rattan cup, a bronze cup and a glass cup.</font>
title_xiake_shp_jiuxian_004=Well, you caught me in a good mood today, so I'll be glad to tell you what you want to know.
title_xiake_shp_jiuxian_005_1=As recommended by the famous poet Li Bai, the jade cup is best for accentuating the delicate bouquet of the fen sorghum liquor.
title_xiake_shp_jiuxian_005_2=Imported vodka - what we sometimes misleadingly call "white wine" in the East -  is a strong, hearty spirit, best poured into a rhino horn cup.
title_xiake_shp_jiuxian_005_3=Wines made from grapes are subtle in their sweetness, especially suited to share with your lady companion! Let a luminous cup brighten your evening of romance!
title_xiake_shp_jiuxian_005_4=Sorghum wine is the quaff for grand occasions. A stately bronze cup is most fitting.
title_xiake_shp_jiuxian_005_5=Do not look down on the humble, everyday rice wine. This is the choice of nobles and peasants alike, and is best consumed in massive quantities in a large cup!
title_xiake_shp_jiuxian_005_6=The uniquely clean taste of herbal wines deserves to be served in a vessel that is just as exotic. An antique rattan cup will do nicely.
title_xiake_shp_jiuxian_005_7=Pear wine has been celebrated in song and poetry since ancient times, and nothing can be more festive than an elegant emerald cup!
title_xiake_shp_jiuxian_005_8=The fine froth of the Yulu mint liquor can be truly appreciated only in a clear glass cup.
title_xiake_shp_jiuxian_005_9=Shaoxing wine is aged beneath the earth to enrich its flavor, which is best preserved in an antique porcelain cup.
menue_xiake_shp_jiuxian_001=You must know a lot about wine and spirits, after all these years of drinking. I'd like to learn a thing or two from you.
menue_xiake_shp_jiuxian_001_1=Here are the 9 different wine cups you requested.
menue_xiake_shp_jiuxian_002=If you say so…I'd rather have wine without a cup, than an empty cup without wine!

menue_xiake_shp_jiuxian_003_6=Which cup is for serving herbal wine?

menue_xiake_shp_jiuxian_003_9=Which cup is for serving Shaoxing wine?

title_xiake_shit_tea_choose_001=Here are my samples of these rare and precious teas. Now, you will need the special water needed to brew these teas properly. To taste these teas in their perfect state is a pleasure like no other; I hope you will not disappoint me.

menue_xiake_shit_tea_choose_001_2=I'll have some Scorpion Tea.
menue_xiake_shit_tea_choose_001_3=I'll have some Snow Fog Tea.
menue_xiake_shit_tea_choose_001_4=I'll have some Drunken Beauty Tea.
title_xiake_shit_tea_choose_002=These are fresh specimens of the rare spring waters I mentioned.
menue_xiake_shit_tea_choose_002_1=Add condensed spring water.
menue_xiake_shit_tea_choose_002_2=Add frosty spring water.
menue_xiake_shit_tea_choose_002_3=Add lava spring water.
menue_xiake_shit_tea_choose_002_4=Add floral dew water.
title_xiake_shit_tea_desc_001=I once traveled all over the world in search of exotic teas. Amongst the many teas I've sampled, four of them are especially outstanding: Rootless Tea, Scorpion Tail Tea, Snow Fog Tea, and Drunken Beauty Tea.
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_001_1=What is Rootless Tea?
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_001_2=What is Scorpion Tail Tea?
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_001_3=What is Snow Fog Tea?
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_001_4=What is Drunken Beauty Tea?
title_xiake_shit_tea_desc_002_1=Rootless tea is grown just above the cloud canopy in the mountains. There, the plants absorb moisture directly from the air, instead of from the roots. This tea is to be infused only with condensed spring water to maintain it delicate purity.
title_xiake_shit_tea_desc_002_2=Scorpion Tail Tea is slowly roasted over the lava pits of an active volcano. It is very intense in its color and flavor. This tea is to be infused only with cold frosty spring water to counter its tremendous heat.
title_xiake_shit_tea_desc_002_3=Snow Fog Tea derives from the harvest of frozen tea leaves in winter, similar to how ice wines are made with frozen grapes. This tea is to be infused only with boiling lava spring water to awaken its deep flavor.
title_xiake_shit_tea_desc_002_4=Drunken Beauty Tea is so named for the intoxicating scent of its blossoms, which are harvested and dried along with the leaves. This tea is to be infused only with floral dew water to accentuate its aroma.
title_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_1=The appreciation of tea can be broadly described in four different experiences: tea drinking, tea sampling, tea making and the way of the tea.
title_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_2=Tea drinking is the simplest, most basic thing you can do with tea, which of course is to quench your thirst.
title_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_3=To sample tea is not just to quench your thirst, but to savor the different feelings one gets to experience whilst tasting the different teas.
title_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_4=Tea making is not just about the technique of growing and preparing teas. In many cultures, especially in Japan, the serving of tea is highly ritualized to highlight its social significance.
title_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_5="Way of the Tea" refers to experience of tea drinking as a metaphor of life itself. As you drink tea, you get to contemplate the meaning of peace, harmony, and the brevity of one's existence on earth.
title_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_6=Well, I've given you quite a lecture. Let me ask you this: What is your preferred setting for sampling tea?
title_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_7=There is no single correct answer to this question. To appreciate tea in the fullest is to be in a rarefied state of mind, and that can be determined only in your heart.
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_1=Interesting. Please tell me more.
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_2=What about tea sampling?
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_3=What about tea making?
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_4=What is the way of the tea?
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_5=I am impressed. Tea drinking is a most profound art indeed!
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_6_1=A quaint little tea stall by the road, under a small thatched roof.
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_6_2=An elegant pavilion at a luxurious estate.
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_6_3=A quiet, private room at a familiar place.
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_6_4=I have no preferences. It's only the tea itself that matters.
menue_xiake_shit_tea_desc_3_6_5=I know.
title_xiake_shit_zongshi_0=You're quite an accomplished fighter for your age! If you can defeat my ten disciples, I will give you a gift.
menue_xiake_shit_zongshi_0=That's very kind of you. Thank you.

menu_newworld_event_xiake_063_3_1=I know a few moves. I can show you, if you like!

title_newworld_event_xiake_063_3_2=Not at all, you're quite good! Here, enjoy your tea, as long as you promise to come back to me tomorrow for a rematch.
newworld_event_xiake_063_3_2_1=Of course! You have my word!
task_newworld_event_xiake_123=Meet your bitter foes with your sword drawn. Then make peace with them over cups of fine tea!
menu_newworld_event_xiake_123_1_1=The aroma of this tea is intoxicating! Where did you get it?
title_newworld_event_xiake_123_1_1=Ha ha…you won't be able to buy this tea around here, I tell you!
menu_newworld_event_xiake_123_2_1=Really? So what's the story behind this little bowl of tea?
title_newworld_event_xiake_123_2_1=Teas are made in many different ways. You start with the fresh, unfermented green tea. When it's fully fermented, you get your red tea. You also have Pu'er as an example of the roasted black tea. Different flowers are also used as infusion ingredients...
menu_newworld_event_xiake_123_3_1=I didn't realize tea comes in so many different varieties!
title_newworld_event_xiake_123_3_1=It's not the leaves themselves that make the teas so different, it's also how you make the tea. It's always best to use the freshest mountain spring water. You also must make sure the leaves are free of any contaminants or impurities.
menu_newworld_event_xiake_123_4_1=I was told that the tea set you use to serve tea also affects its quality. Is this true?
title_newworld_event_xiake_123_4_1=You are well informed indeed! Ceramic kettles made with purple sand is best. To preserve the aroma of the tea, your cup must have a lid. Other utensils for having tea include a pick to remove impurities, a spoon to infuse the exact amount of tea, and a sieve to separate the tea from the leaves.
menu_newworld_event_xiake_123_5_1=All this fuss, over a simple cup of tea!
title_newworld_event_xiake_123_5_1=That's not the last of it! Even the cup itself matters!
menu_newworld_event_xiake_123_6_1=That doesn't surprise me at all.
title_newworld_event_xiake_123_6_1=Blue porcelain is used for delicate green and herbal teas. The darker red or black teas should be served in ceramics made with purple sand to withstand the heat. The common white porcelain will accentuate the color of any tea, and makes a fine conversational piece in itself, as it is often decorated with calligraphy.
menu_newworld_event_xiake_123_7_1=I have no idea that drinking tea is such a sophisticated art.
title_newworld_event_xiake_123_7_1=Now that you do, you will need a lifetime of learning to fully appreciate that little cup of tea of yours! Ha ha!
newworld_event_xiake_123_7_1_1=This is all very fascinating. I look forward to learn all that I can about the art of tea!
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_001=Tea can resolve the feud.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_002=You must be a great expert, to have made such a fine tea! May I ask you a few questions about the art of tea?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_003=Not at all, but I'll be happy to share what I know with you.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_004=What is the main difference among different kinds of tea?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_005=Tell me about the water used to infuse tea.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_006=What are the different utensils for serving tea?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_007=Should different kinds of tea cups be used to serve different teas?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_008=Teas differn mainly in how they are made. You start with the fresh, unfermented green tea. When it's fully fermented, you get your red tea. You also have Pu'er as an example of the roasted black tea. Different flowers are also used as infusion ingredients.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_009=Like the tea leaves themselves, water also plays a role in determining its quality. Of course, we all live in the real world, and have to make do with what we can get.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_010=Ideally, you want fresh mountain spring water, which is not only clean and pure, but embodies the living energy of nature itself. Your next choices are melted snow, purified rain, and even water from running streams and lakes, as long as it is free of any contaminants.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_011=Water for infusing tea must be clean, light, cool and refreshing in itself, and originating from a fresh, lively source. Different teas also call for different temperatures while you infuse them.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_012=Aside from the cup itself, which needs a lid to preserve the tea's delicate aroma, you also need a pick for removing impurities, a spoon to infuse just the right amount of tea, and a sieve to seprate the leaves from the tea once it's ready to drink.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_013=Absolutely! Blue porcelain is best to bring out the subtle flavor of the green and floral teas. For the deeper flavor of the red and black teas, a cup made from purple sand can withstand the heat from the longer brewing time.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_014=Of course! Blue porcelain is best to bring out the subtle flavor of the green and floral teas. The common white porcelain will accentuate the color of any tea, and makes a fine conversational piece in itself, as it is often decorated with calligraphy.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_015=Which of the following is not a tea?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_016=绿茶

Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_022=Maojian green tea.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_023=Which of the following is best for infusing tea?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_024=Pure snow-melted water.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_025=Fresh mountain spring water.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_026=Fresh water from lakes or rivers.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_027=Do different kinds of tea require water at different temperatures?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_028=No. The temperature should all be the same.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_029=Yes. Different teas require different water temperatures.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_030=It doesn't matter.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_031=Which one of these is not a tea utensil?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_032=A sieve.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_033=A bottle.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_034=A spoon.

Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_036=绿茶
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_037=红茶
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_038=<s>
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_039=Why is the white porcelain cup a good conversational piece?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_040=It is easily cleaned.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_041=It is inexpensive.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_042=It is often decorated with calligraphy.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_043=Then let me quiz you to see what you know!
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_044=Thank you. I have learned much.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_045=Correct! Next question!
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_046=Well, I'm glad to see that you have learned something, after all. Won't you join me tomorrow for tea?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_047=You still have much to learn about tea. Come back to me tomorrow, and I'll be happy to tell you more!
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_048=Thank you, I'd be delighted.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_049=Go ahead, ask me anything!
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_050=Of course. I shall look forward to it!
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_051=Keep up the good work. Remember, tea appreciation is an art that stays with you for life!
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_ChaYeWenDa_052=I will keep that in mind.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_001=Ever since I came on this island, all I do is just to survive…finding food, shelter and whatnot. I have not met a single expert who can teach me advanced skills!
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_002=Don't be so discourged, young one! There is a lot for you to discover here, if you keep your eyes open!
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_003=Sometimes I envy the simple life of a fisherman. You have no idea what it feels like, to have aspirations of greatness so unfulfilled!
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_004=Yes, I am but a simple fisherman, but I've seen my share of the likes you, coming and going in search of greatness, but finds none when it is right in front of him!
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_005=What do you know of greatness, of ambition? Do you even have one martial arts scroll that can improve my skills?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_006=No, that I don't have, but I have no need of such things. If you are so reckless in your search for greatness, you will find only misery and despair.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_007=What is the meaning of this?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_008=Never mind that for now, let me ask you something instead. Why do they call this place "Hero Island"?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_009=I hear there is a cavern here, where secrets of advanced martial arts are closely guarded. That is why I, following so many heroes from the mainland and the Eastern Seas, have journeyed to this remote place.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_010=Indeed..and have you met many heroes on this island?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_011=No, not as many as I had hoped, but I do see plenty of bandits, thieves and other lowlife.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_012=Don't you see, those bandits and thieves were once just like you, coming here in search of greatness? But blind ambition had led them astray, and now they're reduced to nothing.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_013=…………
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_014=I have lived on this island for many years. People are fighting each other all the time, but out of all that, few ever emerge as true heroes.
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_015=Why so?
Xiehq_XiaKeDao_cunminwenda_A_016=A true hero is not only skillful, but brave and kind. There are plenty of old scrolls for you to find all over the island, but that which make you truly heroic - deeds of valor and mercy - now those you will have to look very hard indeed!

waiyuruqin_qi_juqingxiangwanfa_903_1=My daughter was badly ill. I had no choice but stole the central plains pill and deserted to the Foreign. Now I've been chased here. Please help me!
waiyuruqin_qi_juqingxiangwanfa_903_2=I was once the heeler of Zhuo Bei but he never put me in an important position. So later I took a central plains master as my master.

waiyuruqin_qi_juqingxiangwanfa_909_4=I'm later. But I'm surprised that these central plains people hadn't rescue a poor child. Maybe I should re-evaluate the competition between the central plains and the Foreign.
waiyuruqin_qi_juqingxiangwanfa_909_5=It's very difficult for the central plains to resist the Foreign. Can you draw out the mechanical diagram of the valley, then I can go to have a investigation by my self.

waiyuruqin_qi_juqingxiangwanfa_919_2=In my opinion, the central plains martial arts are very difficult to be dislodged due to their centuries-old history. So the Foreign Wulin will finally lose its momentum and combine with the central plains. What do you think of it?
