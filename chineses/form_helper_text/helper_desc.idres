In Age of Wushu, after a hero enters a Sect, he or she must abide by its rules to become a legitimate disciple.  <br><s><s>Each Sect has its own set of rules, pertaining to joining the school, becoming a master, punishments and rewards, and other functions.  The rules aren't meant to be burdensome but simply reflect each sect's culture and the overall worldview of the game.  <br><s><s>Each player's unique personality will lead him or her to a different sect and follow its rules. For example, Shaolin disciples may not binge drink or indulge on meat; Wudang disciples may not slay the innocent; Royal Guard disciples must show their tokens when leaving and entering. Wanderer's Valley has very few rules, which suits players of a more libertine personality.  So learn about each sect and gain a deeper understanding of their cultures!  <br><br><font color="#453627">[The Sect Rules]</font><br><br><font color="#453627">[A barometer of relations between Sects: Impression Value]</font><br><s><s>When traveling, pay attention to how you act.

If that value reaches a certain point you might be banned from entering the sect. If you cause the Bad Impression Value to soar, you might become its public enemy, and word will get around. You might even be captured as a result!  So know that what goes around comes around, and reveal your courage and insight. <br><br><font color="#453627">[A Yardstick for Disciple's Comportment: Discipline Value]</font><br><s><s>After joining a sect, you can check your Discipline Value in the Personal Interface and the Sect Interface. If you commit an act that goes against school rules, your sect's Discipline Value will reflect it and increase. When it reaches a certain point you will be punished.  Of course, the Discipline Value can also go down. If you want to lower it, you can go to the sect and atone for your wrongs. <br> <br><font color="#453627">[The Bitterness of Committing Wrongs: Sect Punishment]</font><br><s><s>When your Bad Impression Value at a certain sect or your own Discipline Value reaches a certain point, the sect will punish you.

It's best to avoid these, so don't break the rules. But if your curiosity gets the best of you, just be prepared!
